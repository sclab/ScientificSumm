Securities markets effectively allow traders to place bets
on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions. Examples
include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like
CBOE [17], futures markets like CME [30], other derivatives
markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [11, 12],
sports betting markets [7, 13, 32], horse racing markets [33],
idea futures markets [16], decision markets [14] and even
market games [4, 24, 25]. The economic value of securities
markets is two-fold. First, they allow traders to hedge risk,
or to insure against undesirable outcomes. For example, the
owner of a stock might buy a put option (the right to sell
the stock at a particular price) in order to insure against
a stock downturn. Or the owner of a house may purchase
an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage
to the house. Second, securities markets allow traders to
speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when
market prices do not reflect their assessment of the 
likelihood of future outcomes. For example, a trader might buy
a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that
the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of
risk exposure to changes in the stock price. Because traders
stand to earn a profit if they can make effective 
probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very
accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].
Real securities markets have complex payoff structures
with various triggers. However, these can all be modeled
as collections of more basic or atomic Arrow-Debreu 
securities [1, 8, 20]. One unit of one Arrow-Debreu security pays
off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event
occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur. So, for
example, one unit of a security denoted Acme100 might
pay $1 iff Acme"s stock is above $100 on January 4, 2004.
An Acme stock option as it would be defined on a 
finan144
cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic
securities.1
In this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for
trading in compound securities markets with payoffs 
contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including
conditionals. For example, given binary events A, B, and
C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security 
denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event
A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each. Another trader may
bid to sell six units of a security A|C that pays off $1 iff
A occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event C 
occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if C does
not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the 
security is refunded) [5]. Bids may also be divisible, meaning
that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested
quantity, or indivisible, meaning that bids must be fulfilled
either completely or not at all. Given a set of such bids,
the auctioneer faces a complex matching problem to decide
which bids are accepted for how many units at what price.
Typically, the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own,
only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders, but
we also consider alternative formulations where the 
auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk.
We examine the computational complexity of the 
auctioneer"s matching problem. Let the length of the description
of all the available securities be O(n). With n events, the
matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case
and Σp
2-complete in the indivisible case. This Σp
2-complete
hardness holds even when the bidding language is 
significantly restricted. With log n events, the problem is 
polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible
case.
Section 2 presents some necessary background 
information, motivation, and related work. Section 3 formally 
describes our framework for compound securities, and defines
the auctioneer"s matching problem. Section 4 briefly 
discusses natural algorithms for solving the matching problem.
Section 5 proves our central computational complexity 
results. Section 6 discusses the possibility of tractable special
cases. Section 7 concludes with a summary and some ideas
of future directions.
