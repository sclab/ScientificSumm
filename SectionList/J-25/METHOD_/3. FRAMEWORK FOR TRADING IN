COMPOUND SECURITIES
3.1 High-level description
Common knowledge among agents is the set of events A.
There are no predefined securities. Instead, agents offer to
buy or sell securities of their own design that pay off 
contingent on logical combinations of events and event negations.
Combination operators may include conjunctions, 
disjunctions, and conditionals.
For all practical purposes, it is impossible for agents to
trade in enough securities (2n
) to form a complete market,
so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the 
number and complexity of their bids, and the extent to which
their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed. In its
most general form, the problem is game-theoretic in nature,
since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes
other agents will accept. At the other end of the spectrum, a
simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on
currently available securities at current prices. In between
these two formulations are other possible interesting 
optimization problems. Approximation algorithms might also
be pursued.
The auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy
and sell orders to maximize surplus (the cash and securities
left over after accepted bids are fulfilled). For example, offers
to sell A1A2 at $0.2 and A1
¯A2 at $0.1 can match with an
offer to buy A1 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1. Or an offer to
sell A1 at $0.3 can match with an offer to buy A1A2 at
$0.4, with surplus $0.1 in cash and A1
¯A2 in securities. In
general, a single security might qualify for multiple matches,
but only one can be transacted. So the auctioneer must find
the optimal set of matches that maximizes surplus, which
could be measured in a number of ways. Again, 
approximation algorithms might be considered. In another 
formulation, the auctioneer functions as a market maker willing to
take on a certain amount of risk.
Informally, our motivation is to provide a mechanism that
allows a very high degree of expressivity in placing hedges
and bets, and is also capable of approximating the optimal
(complete-market) allocation of risk, trading off the number
and complexity of securities and transactions needed.
3.2 Formal description
3.2.1 Securities
We use φ and ψ to denote arbitrary boolean formulas, or
logical combinations of events in A. We denote securities
φ|ψ . Securities pay off $1 if and only if (iff) φ and ψ are
true, pay off $0 iff φ is false and ψ is true, and are canceled
(i.e., any price paid is refunded) iff ψ is false. We define
T ≡ Ω to be the event true and F ≡ ∅ to be the event
false. We abbreviate φ|T as φ .
3.2.2 Orders
Agents place orders, denoted o, of the form q units of
φ|ψ at price p per unit, where q > 0 implies a buy
order and q < 0 implies a sell order. We assume agents
submitting buy (sell) orders will accept any price p∗
≤ p
(p∗
≥ p). We distinguish between divisible and indivisible
orders. Agents submitting divisible orders will accept any
quantity αq where 0 < α ≤ 1. Agents submitting 
indivisible orders will accept only exactly q units, or none at all.
We believe that, given the nature of what is being traded
(state-contingent dollars), most agents will be content to
trade using divisible orders.
Every order o can be translated into a payoff vector Υ
across all states ω ∈ Ω. The payoff Υ ω
in state ω is q ·
1ω∈ψ(1ω∈φ − p), where 1ω∈E equals 1 iff ω ∈ E and zero
otherwise. Recall that the 2n
states correspond to the 2n
possible combinations of event outcomes. We index multiple
orders with subscripts (e.g., oi and Υi). Let the set of all
orders be O and the set of all corresponding payoff vectors
be P.
Example 1. (Translating orders into payoff vectors) 
Suppose that |A| = 3. Consider an order to buy two units of
A2 ∨ A3|A1 at price $0.8. The corresponding payoff vector
is:
Υ = Υ A1A2A3

3.2.3 The matching problem
The auctioneer"s task, called the matching problem, is to
determine which orders to accept among all orders o ∈ O.
Let αi be the fraction of order oi accepted by the auctioneer
(in the indivisible case, αi must be either 0 or 1; in the
divisible case, αi can range from 0 to 1). If αi = 0, then
order oi is considered rejected and no transactions take place
concerning this order. For accepted orders (αi > 0), the
auctioneer receives the money lost by bidders and pays out
the money won by bidders, so the auctioneer"s payoff vector
is:
Υauc =
X
Υi∈P
−αiΥi.
We also call the auctioneer"s payoff vector the surplus vector,
since it is the (possibly state-contingent) money left over
after all accepted orders are filled.
Assume that the auctioneer wants to choose a set of orders
so that it is guaranteed not to lose any money in any future
state, but that the auctioneer does not necessarily insist on
obtaining a positive benefit from the transaction (i.e., the
auctioneer is content to break even).
Definition 1. (Matching problem, indivisible case) Given
a set of orders O, does there exist αi ∈ {0, 1} with at least
one αi = 1 such that
∀ω, Υ ω
auc ≥ 0?
In other words, does there exist a nonempty subset of orders
that the auctioneer can accept without risk? 2
If ∀ω, Υ
ω
auc = c where c is nonnegative, then the surplus
leftover after processing this match is c dollars. Let m =
minω[Υ
ω
auc]. In general, processing a match leaves m dollars
in cash and Υ
ω
auc − m in state-contingent dollars, which can
then be translated into securities.
Example 2. (Indivisible order matching) Suppose |A| =
2. Consider an order to buy one unit of A1A2 at price
0.4 and an order to sell one unit of A1 at price 0.3. The

corresponding payoff vectors are:
Υ1 = Υ

¯A1
¯A2
1
= 0.6, −0.4, −0.4, −0.4
Υ2 = −0.7, −0.7, 0.3, 0.3
The auctioneer"s payoff vector (the negative of the 
componentwise sum of the above two vectors) is:
Υauc = −Υ1 − Υ2 = 0.1, 1.1, 0.1, 0.1 .
Since all components are nonnegative, the two orders match.
The auctioneer can process both orders, leaving a surplus of
$0.1 in cash and one unit of A1
¯A2 in securities. 2
Now consider the divisible case, where order can be 
partially filled.
Definition 2. (Matching problem, divisible case) Given
a set of orders O, does there exist αi ∈ [0, 1] with at least
one αi > 0 such that
∀ω, Υ ω
auc ≥ 0,
2
Example 3. (Divisible order matching) Suppose |A| = 2.
Consider an order to sell one unit of A1 at price $0.5, an
order to buy one unit of A1A2|A1 ∨ A2 at price $0.5, and
an order to buy one unit of A1| ¯A2 at price $0.4. The
corresponding payoff vectors are:
Υ1 = Υ
A1A2
1 ,Υ
A1
¯A2

= −0.5, −0.5, 0.5, 0.5
Υ2 = 0.5, −0.5, −0.5, 0
Υ3 = 0, 0.6, 0, −0.4
It is clear by inspection that no non-empty subset of whole
orders constitutes a match: in all cases where αi ∈ {0, 1}
(other than all αi = 0), at least one state sums to a positive
amount (negative for the auctioneer). However, if α1 =
α2 = 3/5 and α3 = 1, then the auctioneer"s payoff vector is:
Υauc = −
3
5
Υ1 −
3
5
Υ2 − Υ3 = 0, 0, 0, 0.1 ,
constituting a match. The auctioneer can process 3/5 of the
first and second orders, and all of the third order, leaving a
surplus of 0.1 units of ¯A1
¯A2 . In this example, a divisible
match exists even though an indivisible match is not possible;
we examine the distinction in detail in Section 5, where we
separate the two matching problems into distinct complexity
classes. 2
The matching problems defined above are decision 
problems: the task is only to show the existence or nonexistence
of a match. However, there may be multiple matches from
which the auctioneer can choose. Sometimes the choices are
equivalent from the auctioneer"s perspective; alternatively,
an objective function can be used to find an optimal match
according to that objective.
Example 4. (Auctioneer alternatives I) Suppose |A| =
2. Consider an order to sell one unit of A1 at price $0.7,
an order to sell one unit of A2 at price $0.7, an order to
buy one unit of A1A2 at price $0.4, an order to buy one
unit of A1
¯A2 at price $0.4, and an order to buy one unit
of ¯A1A2 at price $0.4. The corresponding payoff vectors
are:
Υ1 = −0.3,−0.3, 0.7, 0.7
Υ2 = −0.3, 0.7,−0.3, 0.7
Υ3 = 0.6,−0.4,−0.4,−0.4
Υ4 = −0.4, 0.6,−0.4,−0.4
Υ5 = −0.4,−0.4, 0.6,−0.4
Consider the indivisible case. The auctioneer could choose
to accept bids 1, 3, and 4 together, or the auctioneer could
choose to accept bids 2, 3, and 5 together. Both constitute
matches, and in fact both yield identical payoffs (Υauc =
0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 , or $0.1 in cash) for the auctioneer. 2
Example 5. (Auctioneer alternatives II) Suppose |A| =
2. Consider an order to sell two units of A1 at price $0.6,
an order to buy one unit of A1A2 at price $0.3, and an
order to buy one unit of A1
¯A2 at price $0.5. The 
corresponding payoff vectors are:
Υ1 = −0.4,−0.4, 0.6, 0.6
Υ2 = 0.7,−0.3,−0.3,−0.3
Υ3 = −0.5, 0.5,−0.5,−0.5
Consider the divisible case. The auctioneer could choose to
accept one unit each of all three bids, yielding a payoff to
the auctioneer of $0.2 in cash (Υauc = 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 ).
Alternatively, the auctioneer could choose to accept 4/3 units
of bid 1, and one unit each of bids 2 and 3, yielding a payoff
to the auctioneer of 1/3 units of security A1 . Both choices
constitute matches (in fact, accepting any number of units
of bid 1 between 1 and 4/3 can be part of a match), though
depending on the auctioneer"s objective, one choice might
be preferred over another. For example, if the auctioneer
believes that A1 is very likely to occur, it may prefer to accept
4/3 units of bid 1. 2
There are many possible criteria for the auctioneer to 
decide among matches, all of which seem reasonable in some
circumstances. One natural quantity to maximize is the
volume of trade among bidders; another is the auctioneer"s
utility, either with or without the arbitrage constraint.
Definition 3. (Trade maximization problem) Given a set
of indivisible (divisible) orders O, choose αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈
[0, 1]) to maximize
X
i
αiqi,
under the constraint that
∀ω, Υ ω
auc ≥ 0.
2
Another reasonable variation is to maximize the total 
percent of orders filled, or
P
i αi, under the same (risk-free)
constraint that ∀ω, Υ
ω
auc ≥ 0.
Definition 4. (Auctioneer risk-free utility-maximization
problem) Let the auctioneer"s subjective probability for each
state ω be Pr(ω), and let the auctioneer"s utility for y 
dollars be u(y). Given a set of indivisible (divisible) orders O,
choose αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maximize
X
ω∈Ω
Pr(ω)u(Υ ω
auc),
148
under the constraint that
∀ω, Υ ω
auc ≥ 0.

Definition 5. (Auctioneer standard utility-maximization
problem) Let the auctioneer"s subjective probability for each
state ω be Pr(ω), and let the auctioneer"s utility for y 
dollars be u(y). Given a set of indivisible (divisible) orders O,
choose αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maximize
X
ω∈Ω
Pr(ω)u

Υ ω
auc

.

This last objective function drops the risk-free (arbitrage)
constraint. In this case, the auctioneer is a market maker
with beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes, and the 
auctioneer may actually lose money is some outcomes.
Still other variations and other optimization criteria seem
reasonable, including social welfare, etc. It also seems 
reasonable to suppose that the surplus be shared among bidders
and the auctioneer, rather than retained solely by the 
auctioneer. This is analogous to choosing a common transaction
price in a double auction (e.g., the midpoint between the bid
and ask prices), rather than the buyer paying the bid price
and the seller receiving the ask price, with the difference
going to the auctioneer. The problem becomes more 
complicated when dividing surplus securities, in part because
they are valued differently by different agents. Formulating
reasonable sharing rules and examining the resulting 
incentive properties seems a rich and promising avenue for further
investigation.
