FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We have analyzed the computational complexity of 
matching for securities based on logical formulas. Many possible
avenues for future work exist, including
1. Analyzing the agents" optimization problem:
• How to choose quantities and bid/ask prices for
a collection of securities to maximizes one"s 
expected utility, both for linear and nonlinear utility
functions.
153
• How to choose securities; that is, deciding on
what collection of boolean formulas to offer to
trade, subject to constraints or penalties on the
number or complexity of bids.
• How do make the above choices in a game 
theoretically sound way, taking into account the choices
of other traders, their reasoning about other traders,
etc.
2. Although matching is likely intractable, are there good
heuristics that achieve matches in many cases or 
approximate a matching?
3. Exploring sharing rules for dividing the surplus, and
incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms.
4. We may consider a market to be in computational 
equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find
a strategy that increases utility. With few exceptions
[3, 22], little is known about computational 
equilibriums. A natural question is to determine whether a
market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is
not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances
this may occur.
