7.1 Practical Analyses
According to the former description and analyses, it is easy to
know that the above newly proposed algorithm has the following
properties:
Property 3: When there exist no fault and compromised nodes, by
using new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on
H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the probability of direct pairwise key
establishment between any two nodes can be estimated as
P=(m(u-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1), where N is the total number of nodes in
the sensor network, and N=um
* vn
.
Proof: Since the predistributed pairwise keys for any node FA
={ f iiil n

jjinii m >< −11
,...,,,...,2,1
( jm,y) } in the newly proposed
algorithm. Obviously, in the logical hypercube formed by the
nodes in the same cluster of node A, there are n(v-1) nodes, which
58
have direct pairwise key with node A. And in the logical
hypercube formed by the nodes in different clusters from that of
node A, there are m(u-1) nodes, which have direct pairwise key
with node A. Therefore, there are totally m(u-1)+n(v-1) nodes,
which have direct pairwise key with node A. So, the probability of
pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be
estimated as P=(m(u-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1), since the whole sensor
network has N sensor nodes in all.
Figure.4 presents the comparision between the probability of
direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes and the
dimension n, when the sensor network has different total nodes,
and use the new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on
H(8,2,3,v,n) model.

Figure.4 Comparision between the probability of direct
pairwise key establishment between any two nodes and the
dimension n, when the sensor network has different total
nodes, and use the new pairwise key predistribution scheme
based on H(8,2,3,v,n) model.
From Figure.4, it is easy to know that by using new pairwise key
predistribution scheme based on H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the
probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two
nodes decreases with the increasing of the scale of the sensor
networks, and in addition, the probability of direct pairwise key
establishment between any two nodes decreases with the
increasing of the dimension n, when the scale of the sensor
network is fixed.
Theorem 4: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor
network, then when u ≥ v2
, the probability of direct pairwise key
establishment between any two nodes, when using the key
distribution scheme based on the hypercube model H(v,p), is
smaller than that when using the key distribution scheme based on
the H(k,u,m,v,n) model.
Proof: Since u ≥ v, then we can let u=vt
, where t ≥ 2. Since
the total number of nodes in H(v,p) is vp
=N, the total number of
nodes in H(k,u,m,v,n) is um
* vn
=N. Let p=x+n, then there is
um
*vn
= vx
* vn
⇒ um
=vx
⇒ x=tm.
From the property 3, it is easy to know that the probability of
direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be
estimated as P=(m(u-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1). According to the
description in [7], it is well know that the probability of direct
pairwise key establishment between any two nodes can be
estimated as P"= p(v-1)/(N-1)= (x(v-1)+n(v-1))/(N-1).
Next, we will prove that m(u-1) ≥ x(v-1):
m(u-1)= m(vt
-1), x(v-1)= tm(v-1). Construct a function as
f(t)= vt
-1- t(v-1), where t ≥ 2. When t=2, it is obvious that there is
f(t)= vt
-2v+1=( v-1)2
≥ 0 and f"(t)=t vt-1
- v+1 ≥ 2v- v+1= v+1>0.
So, there is f(t) ≥ 0 ⇒ vt
-1 ≥ t(v-1) ⇒ m(vt
-1) ≥ tm(v-1) ⇒ 
m(u1) ≥ x(v-1).
Therefore, the conclusion of the theorem stands.
As for the conclusion of theorem 4, we give an example to
illustrate.
Supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is
N=214
, and H(k,u,m,v,n)=H(16,4,2,2,10), H(v,p)= H(10,14), then
the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any
two nodes based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model is P= 
(m(u-1)+n(v1))/(N-1)= (2(4-1)+10(2-1))/(214
-1)=16/(214
-1), but the probability
of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based
on the H(v,p) model is P"= p(v-1)/(N-1)=14(2-1)/(214
-1)= 14/(214

1).
Supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is
N, Figure.5 illustrates the comparison between the probability of
direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based
on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model and the probability of direct pairwise
key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(v,p)
model, when u=4 and v=2.

models.
From Figure.5, it is easy to know that the theorem 5 stands.
Theorem 5: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor
network, then the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the
hypercube model H(v,p), is only a special case of the pairwise key
distribution scheme based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model.
Proof: As for the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the
H(k,u,m,v,n) model, let k=1 (u=1, m=0), which means that the
total sensor network includes only one cluster. Then obviously,
the H(k,u,m,v,n) model will degrade into the H(v,n) model.
According to the former anayses in this paper and the definition
of the pairwise key distribution scheme based on the hypercube
model H(v,p) in [7], it is easy to know that the conclusion of the
theorem stands.

7.2 Security Analyses
By using the pairwise key establishment algorithm based on the
H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the intruders can launch two kinds of attacks:
1) The attackers may target the pairwise key between two
particular sensor node, in order to compromise the pairwise key
between them, or prevent them to establish pairwise key. 2) The
attackers may attack against the whole sensor network, inorder to
decrease the probability of the pairwise key establishment, or
increase the cost of the pairwise key establishment.
Attacks against a Pair of sensor nodes
1. Supposing that the intruders want to attack two particular sensor
nodes u,v, where u,v are all not compromised nodes, but the
intruders want to compromise the pairwise key between them.
1) If u,v can establish direct pairwise key, then the only way to
compromise the key is to compromise the common bivariate
polynomial f(x,y) between u,v. Since the degree of the bivariate
polynomial f(x,y) is t, so the intruders need to compromise at least
t+1 sensor nodes that have a share of the bivariate polynomial f(x,y).
2) If u,v can establish indirect pairwise key through intermediate
nodes, then the intruders need to compromise at least one
intermediate node, or compromise the common bivariate
polynomial f(x,y) between two neighboring intermediate nodes. But
even if the intruders succeed to do that, node u and v can still 
reestablish indirect pairwise key through alternative intermediate
nodes.
2. Supposing that the intruders want to attack two particular sensor
nodes u,v, where u,v are all not compromised nodes, but the
intruders want to prevent them to establish the pairwise key.
Then, the intruders need to compromise all of the m+n bivariate
polynomials of node u or v. Since the degree of the bivariate
polynomial f(x,y) is t, so for bivariate polynomial, the intruders need
to compromise at least t+1 sensor nodes that have a share of the
given bivariate polynomial. Therefore, the intruders need to
compromise (m+n)(t+1) sensor nodes altogether to prevent u,v to
establish the pairwise key.
Attacks against the sensor network
Supposing that the Attackers know the distribution of the
polynomials over sensor nodes, it may systematically attack the
network by compromising the polynomials in F one by one in order
to compromise the entire network. Assume the fraction of the
compromised polynomials is pc, then there are up to
N"=pc × { vn
v
N
umv n
n
mn ××+×× ][ }= pc ××N (m+n)
Sensor nodes that have at least one compromised polynomial share.
Among all of the remaining N- N" sensor nodes, none of them
includes a compromised polynomial share. So, the remaining N- N"
sensor nodes can establish direct pairwise key by using any one of
their polynomial shares. However, the indirect pairwise keys in the
remaining N- N" sensor nodes may be affected. And they may need
to re-establish a new indirect pairwise key between them by select
alternative intermediate nodes that do not belong to the N"
compromised nodes.
Supposing that the scale of the sensor network is N=10000, Figure.6
presents the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes
with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks
based on different H(k,u,m,v,n) distribution models.
From Figure.6, it is easy to know that, when the scale of the sensor
network is fixed, the number of the affected sensor nodes in the
sensor network increases with the increasing of the number of
compromised nodes.

networks based on different H(k,u,m,v,n) distribution models.
Theorem 6: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor
network, and the fraction of compromised nodes is pc, then when
u>v, the number of affected nodes of the H(v,p) model based key
predistribution scheme, is bigger than that of the H(k,u,m,v,n) model
based key predistribution scheme.
Proof: Since the number of affected nodes of the H(k,u,m,v,n)
model based key predistribution scheme is pc ××N (m+n), and it is
proved in [7] that the number of affected nodes of the H(v,p) model
based key predistribution scheme is pc ××N p. Let p=x+n, then
there is um

. Since u>v ⇒ x>m ⇒
pc ××N (m+n)< pc ××N (x+n)= pc ××N p.
Supposing that the scale of the sensor network is N=10000, Figure.7
presents the comparison between pc and the number of sensor nodes
with at least one compromised polynomial share in sensor networks
based on H(9,3,2,2,n) and H(2,p) distribution models.
From Figure.7, it is easy to know that the conclusion of theorem 9 is
correct, and the number of the affected sensor nodes in the sensor
network increases with the increasing of the number of
compromised nodes, when the scale of the sensor network is fixed.
