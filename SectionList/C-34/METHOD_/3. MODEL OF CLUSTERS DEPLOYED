SENSOR NETWORKS
In some actual applications of sensor networks, sensors can be
deployed through airplanes. Supposing that the deployment
rounds of sensors are k, and the communication radius of any
sensors is r, then the sensors deployed in the same round can be
regarded as belonging to a same Cluster. We assign a unique
cluster number l (1 ≤ l ≤ k) for each cluster. Supposing that the
sensors form a connected graph in any cluster after deployment
through airplanes, and then the Fig.1 presents an actual model of
clusters deployed sensor networks.
Figure.1 An actual model of clusters deployed sensor
networks.
From Figure.1, it is easy to know that, for a given node A, there
exist lots of nodes in the same cluster of A, which can be
communicated directly with A, since the nodes are deployed
densely in a cluster. But there exist much less nodes in a cluster
neighboring to the cluster of A, which can be communicated
directly with A. since the two clusters are not deployed at the
same time.
