A new hierarchical hypercube model named H(k,u,m,v,n) is
proposed, which can be used for pairwise key predistribution for
cluster deployed sensor networks. And Based on the H(k,u,m,v,n)
model, an innovative pairwise key predistribution scheme and
algorithm are designed respectively, by combing the good
properties of the Polynomial Key and Key Pool encryption
schemes.
The new algorithm uses the good characteristics of node codes
and high fault-tolerance of H(k,u,m,v,n) model to route and
predistribute pairwise keys, in which nodes are not needed to be
able to communicate with each other directly such as that the
algorithms proposed by [7] shall need. So, the traditional pairwise
key predistribution algorithm based on hypercube model [7] is
only a special case of the new algorithm proposed in this paper.
Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the newly
proposed algorithm is an efficient pairwise key establishment
algorithm that is suitable for the cluster deployed sensor networks.
