In this paper we have exposed a formal model of semantic
alignment as a sequence of information-channel refinements
that are relative to the particular states of the environment
in which two agents communicate and align their respective
conceptualisations of these states. Before us, Kent [6] and
Kalfoglou and Schorlemmer [4, 10] have applied Channel
Theory to formalise semantic alignment using also Barwise
and Seligman"s insight to focus on tokens as the enablers
of information flow. Their approach to semantic alignment,
however, like most ontology matching mechanisms 
developed to date (regardless of whether they follow a functional,
design-time-based approach, or an interaction-based, 
runtime-based approach), still defines semantic alignment in
terms of a priori design decisions such as the concept 
taxonomy of the ontologies or the external sources brought into
the alignment process. Instead the model we have presented
in this paper makes explicit the particular states of the 
environment in which agents are situated and are attempting
to gradually align their ontological entities.
In the future, our effort will focus on the practical side of
the situated semantic alignment problem. We plan to 
further refine the model presented here (e.g., to include 
pragmatic issues such as termination criteria for the alignment
process) and to devise concrete ontology negotiation 
protocols based on this model that agents may be able to enact.
The formal model exposed in this paper will constitute a
solid base of future practical results.
