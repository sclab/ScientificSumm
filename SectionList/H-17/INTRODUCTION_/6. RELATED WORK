[3, 30] provide a good overview of inverted indexing in Web
search engines and IR systems. Experimental studies and analyses
of various partitioning schemes for an inverted index are presented
in [6, 23, 33]. The pruning algorithms that we have presented in
this paper are independent of the partitioning scheme used.
The works in [1, 5, 7, 20, 27] are the most related to ours, as they
describe pruning techniques based on the idea of keeping the 
postings that contribute the most in the final ranking. However, [1, 5, 7,
27] do not consider any query-independent quality (such as 
PageRank) in the ranking function. [32] presents a generic framework
for computing approximate top-k answers with some probabilistic
bounds on the quality of results. Our work essentially extends [1,
2, 4, 7, 20, 27, 31] by proposing mechanisms for providing the
correctness guarantee to the computed top-k results.
Search engines use various methods of caching as a means of 
reducing the cost associated with queries [18, 19, 21, 31]. This thread
of work is also orthogonal to ours because a caching scheme may
operate on top of our p-index in order to minimize the answer 
computation cost. The exact ranking functions employed by current
search engines are closely guarded secrets. In general, however,
the rankings are based on query-dependent relevance and 
queryindependent document quality. Query-dependent relevance can
be calculated in a variety of ways (see [3, 30]). Similarly, there are a
number of works that measure the quality of the documents, 
typically as captured through link-based analysis [17, 28, 26]. Since
our work does not assume a particular form of ranking function, it
is complementary to this body of work.
There has been a great body of work on top-k result calculation.
The main idea is to either stop the traversal of the inverted lists
early, or to shrink the lists by pruning postings from the lists [14,
4, 11, 8]. Our proof for the correctness indicator function was 
primarily inspired by [12].
