Web search engines typically prune their large-scale inverted 
indexes in order to scale to enormous query loads. While this 
approach may improve performance, by computing the top results
from a pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in
the result quality. In this paper, we provided a framework for
new pruning techniques and answer computation algorithms that
guarantee that the top matching pages are always placed at the
top of search results in the correct order. We studied two pruning
techniques, namely keyword-based and document-based pruning as
well as their combination. Our experimental results demonstrated
that our algorithms can effectively be used to prune an inverted
index without degradation in the quality of results. In particular, a
keyword-pruned index can guarantee 73% of the queries with a size
of 30% of the full index, while a document-pruned index can 
guarantee 68% of the queries with the same size. When we combine the
two pruning algorithms we can guarantee 60% of the queries with
an index size of 16%. It is our hope that our work will help search
engines develop better, faster and more efficient indexes and thus
provide for a better user search experience on the Web.
