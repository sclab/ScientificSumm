We use in this paper real hotel reviews collected from the
popular travel site TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor indexes hotels
from cities across the world, along with reviews written by
travelers. Users can search the site by giving the hotel"s
name and location (optional). The reviews for a given hotel
are displayed as a list (ordered from the most recent to the
oldest), with 5 reviews per page. The reviews contain:
• information about the author of the review (e.g., dates
of stay, username of the reviewer, location of the 
reviewer);
• the overall rating (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest);
• a textual review containing a title for the review, free
comments, and the main things the reviewer liked and
disliked;
• numerical ratings (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest) for
different features (e.g., cleanliness, service, location,
etc.)
Below the name of the hotel, TripAdvisor displays the
address of the hotel, general information (number of rooms,
number of stars, short description, etc), the average overall
rating, the TripAdvisor ranking, and an average rating for
each feature. Figure 1 shows the page for a popular Boston
hotel whose name (along with advertisements) was explicitly
erased.
We selected three cities for this study: Boston, Sydney
and Las Vegas. For each city we considered all hotels that
had at least 10 reviews, and recorded all reviews. Table 1
presents the number of hotels considered in each city, the
total number of reviews recorded for each city, and the 
distribution of hotels with respect to the star-rating (as 
available on the TripAdvisor site). Note that not all hotels have
a star-rating.
Table 1: A summary of the data set.
City # Reviews # Hotels # of Hotels with
1,2,3,4 & 5 stars
Boston 3993 58 1+3+17+15+2
Sydney 1371 47 0+0+9+13+10
Las Vegas 5593 40 0+3+10+9+6
For each review we recorded the overall rating, the 
textual review (title and body of the review) and the numerical
rating on 7 features: Rooms(R), Service(S), Cleanliness(C),
Value(V), Food(F), Location(L) and Noise(N). 
TripAdvisor does not require users to submit anything other than
the overall rating, hence a typical review rates few 
additional features, regardless of the discussion in the textual
comment. Only the features Rooms(R), Service(S), 
Cleanliness(C) and Value(V) are rated by a significant number
of users. However, we also selected the features Food(F),
Location(L) and Noise(N) because they are referred to in a
significant number of textual comments. For each feature we
record the numerical rating given by the user, or 0 when the
rating is missing. The typical length of the textual comment
amounts to approximately 200 words. All data was collected
by crawling the TripAdvisor site in September 2006.
2.1 Formal notation
We will formally refer to a review by a tuple (r, T) where:
• r = (rf ) is a vector containing the ratings
rf ∈ {0, 1, . . . 5} for the features f ∈ F =
{O, R, S, C, V, F, L, N}; note that the overall rating,
rO, is abusively recorded as the rating for the feature
Overall(O);
• T is the textual comment that accompanies the review.

Reviews are indexed according to the variable i, such that
(ri
, Ti
) is the ith
review in our database. Since we don"t
record the username of the reviewer, we will also say that
the ith
review in our data set was submitted by user i. When
we need to consider only the reviews of a given hotel, h, we
will use (ri(h)
, Ti(h)
) to denote the ith
review about the hotel
h.
