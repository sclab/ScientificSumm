Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general
purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for
many queries. As a new trend, vertical search has shown
promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge
and is more effective in connecting users with the 
information they want. There are many vertical search engines,
including some for paper search (e.g. Libra [21], Citeseer
[7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g. Froogle
[5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6],
local search [2], as well as news search [3]. We believe the
vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.
Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data
crawling, information extraction, object identification and
integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or
Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the
most important factors. This is because it deals with the
core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming
from multiple communities.
Although object-level ranking has been well studied in
building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds
of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively
ranked. For example, algorithms that evolved from 
PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed
to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can
only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.
Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in 
paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g.
conferences). This allows heterogeneous objects to be well
linked to form a graph through leveraging all the 
relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among
the multiple communities.
However, this assumption does not always stand for some
domains. High-quality photo search, movie search and news
search are exceptions. For example, a photograph forum
377
website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, 
authors and reviewers. Yet different photo forums seem to
lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.
This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited
are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical 
photos. Consequently, although each photo has a rating score
in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from 
different photo forums. Similar problems also exist in movie
search and news search. Although two movie titles can be
identified as the same one by title and director in different
movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine 
rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies
effectively. We call such non-trivial object relationship in
which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.
Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web
[13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost
[15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12]. We will contrast
differences of these methods with the proposed methods 
after we have described the problem and our methods.
We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking 
problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with 
incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo
search as the test bed for this investigation. In the following,
we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo
search.
1.1 High-Quality Photo Search
In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become
an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge
number of images. However, compared to the more than 1
billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual
queries submitted to image search engines are relatively 
minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text
queries submitted to commercial search engines [24]. This
is partially because user requirements for image search are
far less than those for general text search. On the other
hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well
meet various user requirements, because there is no 
effective and practical solution to understand image content.
To better understand user needs in image search, we 
conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search
engine. The result shows that more than 20% of image
search queries are related to nature and places and daily
life categories. Users apparently are interested in enjoying
high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of 
locations or other kinds. However, such user needs are not
well supported by current image search engines because of
the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.
Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the
ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two
key factors: relevance and quality. For the relevance 
factor, search in current commercial image search engines 
provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries,
except for some ambiguity. However, as to quality factor,
there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.
Though content-based image quality assessment has been
investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from
ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate
future.
Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image
search engine that can fulfill the potentially large 
requirement of enjoying high-quality photos. Various proliferating
Web communities, however, notices us that people today
have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the
Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for
building a better image search engine.
In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher
quality than personal photos, and are also much more 
appealing to public users than personal photos. In addition,
photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich 
metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to
be provide by photographers. These metadata are actually
the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly
can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.
More important, there are volunteer users in Web 
communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.
The rating information is generally of great value in solving
the photo quality ranking problem.
Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting
to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich
metadata and integrating information form various photo
Web forums. In this paper, we specifically focus on how to
rank photos from multiple Web forums.
Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums
can be empirically normalized based on the number of 
photos and the number of users in each forum. However, such
a straightforward approach usually requires large manual
effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective 
results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are
tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine. To address
this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between
different photo forums. That is, we first adopt an efficient
algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered
as hidden links connecting multiple forums. We then 
formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem,
which eventually results in an optimal ranking function.
1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. We have proposed and built a vertical image search 
engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo
forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching
for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is 
impossible in traditional image search engines.
2. We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking
algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships,
which can automatically and efficiently integrate as
many as possible Web communities with rating 
information and achieves an equal qualitative result 
compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the 
ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between
different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the 
optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some
other related research. In Section 3, we describe the 
experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted
to evaluate our algorithm. Our conclusion and a discussion
of future work is in Section 4.
It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo
search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking
algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that
includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, 
sculptures, music, and so on.
