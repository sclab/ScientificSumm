In this paper, we studied the Web object-ranking 
problem in the cases of lacking object relationships where 
traditional ranking algorithms are no longer valid, and took
high-quality photo search as the test bed for this 
investigation. We have built a vertical high-quality photo search
engine, and proposed score fusion methods which can 
automatically integrate as many data sources (Web forums) as
possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden
links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and
minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different
forums. Both the intermediate results and the user 
studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical
and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the 
aforesaid relationships. Though the experiments were conducted
on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are
also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video
clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and
so on.
Current system is far from being perfect. In order to make
this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the
vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed. The
following points, for example, may improve the searching
results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle 
analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g.,
novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various
communities who may have different interests and 
preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. 
incorporating more useful information, including photographers" and
reviewers" information, to model the photos in a 
heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.
We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend
relevant high-quality photos to browsers.
One open problem is whether we can find an objective and
efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead
of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which
blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning
parameters in one algorithm.
