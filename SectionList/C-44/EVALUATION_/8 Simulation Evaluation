Our evaluation of MSP was conducted on three platforms:
(i) an indoor system with 46 MICAz motes using straight-line
scan, (ii) an outdoor system with 20 MICAz motes using sound
wave propagation, and (iii) an extensive simulation under 
various kinds of physical settings.
In order to understand the behavior of MSP under 
numerous settings, we start our evaluation with simulations.
Then, we implemented basic MSP and all the advanced
MSP methods for the case where time synchronization is
available in the network. The simulation and 
implementation details are omitted in this paper due to space 
constraints, but related documents [25] are provided online at
http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/MSP. Full implementation and
evaluation of system without time synchronization are yet to be
completed in the near future.
In simulation, we assume all the node sequences are perfect
so as to reveal the performance of MSP achievable in the 
absence of incomplete node sequences or sequence flips. In our
simulations, all the anchor nodes and target nodes are assumed
to be deployed uniformly. The mean and maximum errors are
averaged over 50 runs to obtain high confidence. For legibility
reasons, we do not plot the confidence intervals in this paper.
All the simulations are based on the straight-line scan example.
We implement three scan strategies:
• Random Scan: The slope of the scan line is randomly 
chosen at each time.
• Regular Scan: The slope is predetermined to rotate 
uniformly from 0 degree to 180 degrees. For example, if the
system scans 6 times, then the scan angles would be: 0,
30, 60, 90, 120, and 150.
• Adaptive Scan: The slope of each scan is determined
based on the localization results from previous scans.
We start with basic MSP and then demonstrate the 
performance improvements one step at a time by adding (i) 
sequencebased MSP, (ii) iterative MSP, (iii) DBE MSP and (iv) adaptive
MSP.
8.1 Performance of Basic MSP
The evaluation starts with basic MSP, where we compare the
performance of random scan and regular scan under different
configurations. We intend to illustrate the impact of the number
of anchors M, the number of scans d, and target node density
(number of target nodes N in a fixed-size region) on the 
localization error. Table 1 shows the default simulation parameters.
The error of each node is defined as the distance between the
estimated location and the real position. We note that by 
default we only use three anchors, which is considerably fewer
than existing range-free solutions [8, 4].
Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we 
compare regular scan with random scan under a different number
of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. The number of anchors

Figure 15. Improvements of Sequence-Based MSP over Basic MSP
is 3 by default. Figure 14(a) indicates the following: (i) as
the number of scans increases, the localization error decreases
significantly; for example, localization errors drop more than
60% from 3 scans to 30 scans; (ii) statistically, regular scan
achieves better performance than random scan under identical
number of scans. However, the performance gap reduces as
the number of scans increases. This is expected since a large
number of random numbers converges to a uniform 
distribution. Figure 14(a) also demonstrates that MSP requires only
a small number of anchors to perform very well, compared to
existing range-free solutions [8, 4].
Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we
compare regular scan with random scan under different 
number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. The results shown in
Figure 14(b) indicate that (i) as the number of anchor nodes
increases, the localization error decreases, and (ii) 
statistically, regular scan obtains better results than random scan with
identical number of anchors. By combining Figures 14(a)
and 14(b), we can conclude that MSP allows a flexible tradeoff
between physical cost (anchor nodes) and soft cost 
(localization events).
Impact of the Target Node Density: In this experiment, we
confirm that the density of target nodes has no impact on the
accuracy, which motivated the design of sequence-based MSP.
In this experiment, we compare regular scan with random scan
under different number of target nodes from 10 to 190 in steps
of 20. Results in Figure 14(c) show that mean localization 
errors remain constant across different node densities. However,
when the number of target nodes increases, the average 
maximum error increases.
Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that
in basic MSP, regular scan are better than random scan under
different numbers of anchors and scan events. This is because
regular scans uniformly eliminate the map from different 
directions, while random scans would obtain sequences with 
redundant overlapping information, if two scans choose two similar
scanning slopes.
8.2 Improvements of Sequence-Based MSP
This section evaluates the benefits of exploiting the order
information among target nodes by comparing sequence-based
MSP with basic MSP. In this and the following sections, 
regular scan is used for straight-line scan event generation. The
purpose of using regular scan is to keep the scan events and
the node sequences identical for both sequence-based MSP and
basic MSP, so that the only difference between them is the 
sequence processing procedure.
Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we
compare sequence-based MSP with basic MSP under different
number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. Figure 15(a) 
indicates significant performance improvement in sequence-based
MSP over basic MSP across all scan settings, especially when
the number of scans is large. For example, when the number
of scans is 30, errors in sequence-based MSP are about 20%
of that of basic MSP. We conclude that sequence-based MSP
performs extremely well when there are many scan events.
Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we
use different number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. As
seen in Figure 15(b), the mean error and maximum error of
sequence-based MSP is much smaller than that of basic MSP.
Especially when there is limited number of anchors in the 
system, e.g., 3 anchors, the error rate was almost halved by 
using sequence-based MSP. This phenomenon has an interesting
explanation: the cutting lines created by anchor nodes are 
exploited by both basic MSP and sequence-based MSP, so as the

number of anchor nodes increases, anchors tend to dominate
the contribution. Therefore the performance gaps lessens.
Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 15(c) 
demonstrates the benefits of exploiting order information among 
target nodes. Since sequence-based MSP makes use of the 
information among the target nodes, having more target nodes
contributes to the overall system accuracy. As the number of
target nodes increases, the mean error and maximum error of
sequence-based MSP decreases. Clearly the mean error in 
basic MSP is not affected by the number of target nodes, as shown
in Figure 15(c).
Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that
exploiting order information among target nodes can improve
accuracy significantly, especially when the number of events is
large but with few anchors.
8.3 Iterative MSP over Sequence-Based MSP
In this experiment, the same node sequences were processed
iteratively multiple times. In Figure 16, the two single marks
are results from basic MSP, since basic MSP doesn"t perform
iterations. The two curves present the performance of 
iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that
when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to
sequence-based MSP. Therefore, Figure 16 compares the three
methods to one another.
Figure 16 shows that the second iteration can reduce the
mean error and maximum error dramatically. After that, the
performance gain gradually reduces, especially when c > 5.
This is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to 
exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first 
iteration. Such exploitation decays quickly over iterations.
8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP
Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with
distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE
MSP could bring about statistically better performance. 
Figure 17 presents cumulative distribution localization errors. In
general, the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly to the left
of that of non-DBE MSP, which indicates that DBE MSP has
a smaller statistical mean error and averaged maximum error
than non-DBE MSP. We note that because DBE is augmented
on top of the best solution so far, the performance 
improvement is not significant. When we apply DBE on basic MSP
methods, the improvement is much more significant. We omit
these results because of space constraints.
8.5 Improvements of Adaptive MSP
This section illustrates the performance of adaptive MSP
over non-adaptive MSP. We note that feedback-based 
adaptation can be applied to all MSP methods, since it affects only
the scanning angles but not the sequence processing. In this
experiment, we evaluated how adaptive MSP can improve the
best solution so far. The default angle granularity (step) for
adaptive searching is 5 degrees.
Impact of Area Shape: First, if system settings are regular,
the adaptive method hardly contributes to the results. For a
square area (regular), the performance of adaptive MSP and
regular scans are very close. However, if the shape of the area
is not regular, adaptive MSP helps to choose the appropriate
localization events to compensate. Therefore, adaptive MSP
can achieve a better mean error and maximum error as shown
in Figure 18(a). For example, adaptive MSP improves 
localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is
10.
Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 18(a) shows that
when the node density is low, adaptive MSP brings more 
benefit than when node density is high. This phenomenon makes
statistical sense, because the law of large numbers tells us that
node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when
the number of nodes is increased. Adaptive MSP has an edge
25

when layout is not uniform.
Impact of Candidate Angle Density: Figure 18(b) shows that
the smaller the candidate scan angle step, the better the 
statistical performance in terms of mean error. The rationale is clear,
as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive MSP more 
opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle.
8.6 Simulation Summary
Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated 
step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other
to improve localization performance. In other words, these 
optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly 
improve the overall performance. We note that our simulations
were done under assumption that the complete node sequence
can be obtained without sequence flips. In the next section, we
present two real-system implementations that reveal and 
address these practical issues.
