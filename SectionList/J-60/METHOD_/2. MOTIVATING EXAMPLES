In this section we examine the concepts of subgame perfect
and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies for
completely informed and p-informed environments. We also
present the notion of q-maliciousness and some other related
considerations through two illustrative examples.
2.1 The Fair Assignment Problem
Our first example is an adjustment to computerized 
context of an ancient procedure to ensure that the wealthiest
man in Athens would sponsor a theatrical production known
as the Choregia [27]. In the fair assignment problem, Alice
and Bob are two workers, and there is a new task to be 
performed. Their goal is to assign the task to the least loaded
worker without any monetary transfers. The informational
assumption is that Alice and Bob know both loads and the
duration of the new task.3
2
E.g., minimizing the makespan within a factor of 2 [32] and
Rawls" Rule over some multi-dimensional domains [20].
3
In first glance one might ask why the completely informed
agents could not simply sign a contract, specifying the 
desired goal. Such a contract is sometimes infeasible due to
fact that the true state cannot be observed by outsiders,
especially not the court.
Claim 1. The fair assignment goal cannot be implemented
in dominant strategies.4
2.1.1 Basic Mechanism
The following simple mechanism implements this goal in
subgame perfect equilibrium.
• Stage 1: Alice either agrees to perform the new task
or refuses.
• Stage 2: If she refuses, Bob has to choose between:
- (a) Performing the task himself.
- (b) Exchanging his load with Alice and 
performing the new task as well.
Let LT
A, LT
B be the true loads of Alice and Bob, and let
t > 0 be the load of the new task. Assume that load 
exchanging takes zero time and cost. We shall see that the
basic mechanism achieves the goal in a subgame perfect
equilibrium. Intuitively this means that in equilibrium each
player will choose his best action at each point he might
reach, assuming similar behavior of others, and thus every
SPE is a Nash equilibrium.
Claim 2. ([27]) The task is assigned to the least loaded
worker in subgame perfect equilibrium.
Proof. By backward induction argument (look forward
and reason backward), consider the following cases:
1. LT
B ≤ LT
A. If stage 2 is reached then Bob will not
exchange.
2. LT
A < LT
B < LT
A + t. If stage 2 is reached Bob will
exchange, and this is what Alice prefers.
3. LT
A + t ≤ LT
B. If stage 2 is reached then Bob would
exchange, as a result it is strictly preferable by Alice
to perform the task.
Note that the basic mechanism does not use monetary
transfers at all and is decentralized in the sense that no third
party is needed to run the procedure. The goal is achieved in
equilibrium (ties are broken in favor of Alice). However, in
the second case exchange do occur in an equilibrium point.
Recall the unrealistic assumption that load exchange takes
zero time and cost. Introducing fines, the next mechanism
overcomes this drawback.
2.1.2 Elicitation Mechanism
In this subsection we shall see a centralized mechanism for
the fair assignment goal without load exchange in 
equilibrium. The additional assumptions are as follows. The cost
performing a load of duration d is exactly d. We assume
that the duration t of the new task is < T. The payoffs

proof: Assume that there exists a mechanism that 
implements this goal in dominant strategies. Then by the 
Revelation Principle [23] there exists a mechanism that implements
this goal for which the dominant strategy of each player is
to report his true load. Clearly, truthfully reporting cannot
be a dominant strategy for this goal (if monetary transfers
are not available), as players would prefer to report higher
loads.
242
of the utility maximizers agents are quasilinear. The 
following mechanism is an adaptation of Moore and Repullo"s
elicitation mechanism [28]5
.
• Stage 1: (Elicitation of Alice"s load)
Alice announces LA.
Bob announces LA ≤ LA.
If LA = LA (Bob agrees) goto the next Stage.
Otherwise (Bob challenges), Alice is assigned the
task.
She then has to choose between:
- (a) Transferring her original load to Bob and 
paying him LA − 0.5 · min{ , LA − LA}.
Alice pays to the mechanism.
Bob pays the fine of T + to the mechanism.
- (b) No load transfer. Alice pays to Bob. STOP.
• Stage 2: The elicitation of Bob"s load is similar to
Stage 1 (switching the roles of Alice and Bob).
• Stage 3: If LA < LB Alice is assigned the task,
otherwise Bob. STOP.
Observe that Alice is assigned the task and fined with
whenever Bob challenges. We shall see that the bonus of
is paid to a challenging player only in out of equilibria cases.
Claim 3. If the mechanism stops at Stage 3, then the
payoff of each agent is at least −t and at most 0.
Proposition 1. It is a subgame perfect equilibrium of the
elicitation mechanism to report the true load, and to 
challenge with the true load only if the other agent overreports.
Proof. Assume w.l.o.g that the elicitation of Alice"s load
is done after Bob"s, and that Stage 2 is reached. If Alice
truly reports LA = LT
A, Bob strictly prefers to agree. 
Otherwise, if Bob challenges, Alice would always strictly prefer
to transfer (as in this case Bob would perform her load for
smaller cost), as a result Bob would pay T + to the 
mechanism. This punishing outcome is less preferable than the
normal outcome of Stage 3 achieved had he agreed.
If Alice misreports LA > LT
A, then Bob can ensure himself
the bonus (which is always strictly preferable than reaching
Stage 3) by challenging with LA = LT
A, and so whenever
Bob gets the bonus Alice gains the worst of all payoffs.
Reporting a lower load LA < LT
A is not beneficial for Alice.
In this case, Bob would strictly prefer to agree (and not to
announce LA < LA, as he limited to challenge with a smaller
load than what she announces). Thus such misreporting can
only increase the possibility that she is assigned the task.
And so there is no incentive for Alice to do so.
All together, Alice would prefer to report the truth in this
stage. And so Stage 2 would not abnormally end by STOP,
and similarly Stage 1.
Observe that the elicitation mechanism is almost balanced:
in all outcomes no money comes in or out, except for the
non-equilibrium outcome (a), in which both players pay to
the mechanism.
5
In [28], if an agent misreport his type then it is always
beneficial to the other agent to challenge. In particular,
even if the agent reports a lower load.
2.1.3 Elicitation Mechanism for Partially Informed
Agents
In this subsection we consider partially informed agents.
Formally:
Definition 1. An agent A is p-informed about agent B,
if A knows the type of B with probability p (independently
of what B knows).
It turns out that a version of the elicitation mechanism
works for this relaxed information assumption, if we use the
concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated 
strategies6
. We replace the fixed fine of in the elicitation 
mechanism with the fine:
βp = max{L,
1 − p
2p − 1
T} + ,
and assume the bounds LT
A, LT
B ≤ L.
Proposition 2. If all agents are p-informed, p > 0.5,
the elicitation mechanism(βp) implements the fair 
assignment goal with the concept of iterative elimination of weakly
dominated strategies. The strategy of each player is to report
the true load and to challenge with the true load if the other
agent overreport.
Proof. Assume w.l.o.g that the elicitation of Alice"s load
is done after Bob"s, and that Stage 2 is reached. First 
observe that underreporting the true value is a dominated
strategy, whether Bob is not informed and mistakenly
challenges with a lower load (as βp ≥ L) or not, or even
if t is very small. Now we shall see that overreporting her
value is a dominated strategy, as well.
Alice"s expected payoff gained by misreporting ≤
p (payoff if she lies and Bob is informed) +(1 − p) (max
payoff if Bob is not informed) ≤
p (−t − βp) < p (−t) + (1 − p) (−t − βp) ≤
p (min payoff of true report if Bob is informed) + (1 − p)
(min payoff if Bob is not informed) ≤
Alice"s expected payoff if she truly reports.
The term (−t−βp) in the left hand side is due to the fact
that if Bob is informed he will always prefer to challenge.
In the right hand side, if he is informed, then challenging is
a dominated strategy, and if he is not informed the worst
harm he can make is to challenge. Thus in stage 2 Alice will
report her true load. This implies that challenging without
being informed is a dominated strategy for Bob.
This argument can be reasoned also for the first stage,
when Bob reports his value. Bob knows the maximum payoff
he can gain is at most zero since he cannot expect to get the
bonus in the next stage.
2.1.4 Extensions
The elicitation mechanism for partially informed agents is
rather general. As in [28], we need the capability to judge
between two distinct declarations in the elicitation rounds,
6
A strategy si of player i is weakly dominated if there exists
si such that (i) the payoff gained by si is at least as high as
the payoff gained by si, for all strategies of the other players
and all preferences, and (ii) there exist a preference and a
combination of strategies for the other players such that the
payoff gained by si is strictly higher than the payoff gained
by si.
243
and upper and lower bounds based on the possible payoffs
derived from the last stage. In addition, for p-informed 
environments, some structure is needed to ensure that 
underbidding is a dominated strategy.
The Choregia-type mechanisms can be applied to more
than 2 players with the same number of stages: the player in
the first stage can simply points out the name of the 
wealthiest agent. Similarly, the elicitation mechanisms can be 
extended in a straightforward manner. These mechanisms can
be budget-balanced, as some player might replace the role
of the designer, and collect the fines, as observed in [28].
Open Problem 1. Design a decentralized budget balanced
mechanism with reasonable fines for independently p-informed
n players, where p ≤ 1 − 1/2

n−1 .
2.2 Seller and Buyer Scenario
A player might cause severe harm to others by choosing a
non-equilibrium outcome. In the mechanism for the fair 
assignment goal, an agent might maliciously challenge even
if the other agent truly reports his load. In this subsection
we consider such malicious scenarios. For the ease of 
exposition we present a second example. We demonstrate that
equilibria remain unchanged even if players are malicious.
In the seller-buyer example there is one item to be traded
and two possible future states. The goal is to sell the item for
the average low price pl = ls+lb
2
in state L, and the higher
price ph = hs+hb
2
in the other state H, where ls is seller"s
cost and lb is buyer"s value in state L, and similarly hs, hb in
H. The players fix the prices without knowing what will be
the future state. Assume that ls < hs < lb < hb, and that
trade can occur in both prices (that is, pl, ph ∈ (hs, lb)).
Only the players can observe the realization of the true
state. The payoffs are of the form ub = xv−tb, us = ts −xvs,
where the binary variable x indicates if trade occurred, and
tb, ts are the transfers. Consider the following decentralized
trade mechanism.
• Stage 1: If seller reports H goto Stage 2. Otherwise,
trade at the low price pl. STOP.
• Stage 2: The buyer has to choose between:
- (a) Trade at the high price ph.
- (b) No trade and seller pays ∆ to the buyer.
Claim 4. Let ∆ = lb−ph+ . The unique subgame perfect
equilibrium of the trade mechanism is to report the true state
in Stage 1 and trading if Stage 2 is reached.
Note that the outcome (b) is never chosen in equilibrium.
2.2.1 Trade Mechanism for Malicious Agents
The buyer might maliciously punish the seller by 
choosing the outcome (b) when the true state is H. The following
notion quantifies the consideration that a player is not 
indifferent to the private surpluses of others.
Definition 2. A player is q-malicious if his payoff equals:
(1 − q) (his private surplus) − q (summation of others
surpluses), q ∈ [0, 1].
This definition appeared independently in [7] in different
context. We shall see that the traders would avoid such bad
behavior if they are q-malicious, where q < 0.5, that is if
their non-indifference impact is bounded by 0.5. 
Equilibria outcomes remain unchanged, and so cooperation is
achieved as in the original case of non-malicious players.
Consider the trade mechanism with pl = (1 − q) hs + q lb ,
ph = q hs + (1 − q) lb , ∆ = (1 − q) (hb − lb − ). Note that
pl < ph for q < 0.5.
Claim 5. If q < 0.5, then the unique subgame perfect
equilibrium for q-malicious players remains unchanged.
Proof. By backward induction we consider two cases.
In state H, the q-malicious buyer would prefer to trade if
(1 − q)(hb − ph) + q(hs − ph) > (1 − q)∆ + q(∆). Indeed,
(1 − q)hb + qhs > ∆ + ph. Trivially, the seller prefers to
trade at the higher price, (1 − q)(pl − hs) + q(pl − hb) <
(1 − q)(ph − hs) + q(ph − hb).
In state L the buyer prefers the no trade outcome, as
(1−q)(lb −ph)+q(ls −ph) < ∆. The seller prefers to trade
at a low price, as (1 − q)(pl − ls) + q(pl − lb) > 0 > −∆.
2.2.2 Discussion
No mechanism can Nash-implement this trading goal if
the only possible outcomes are trade at pl and trade at ph.
To see this, it is enough to consider normal forms (as any 
extensive form mechanism can be presented as a normal one).
Consider a matrix representation, where the seller is the row
player and the buyer is the column player, in which every 
entry includes an outcome. Suppose there is equilibrium entry
for the state L. The associate column must be all pl, 
otherwise the seller would have an incentive to deviate. Similarly,
the associate row of the H equilibrium entry must be all ph
(otherwise the buyer would deviate), a contradiction. 7 8
The buyer prefers pl and seller ph, and so the preferences
are identical in both states. Hence reporting preferences
over outcomes is not enough - players must supply 
additional information. This is captured by outcome (b) in
the trade mechanism.
Intuitively, if a goal is not Nash-implementable we need
to add more outcomes. The drawback is that some new
additional equilibria must be ruled out. E.g., additional
Nash equilibrium for the trade mechanism is (trade at pl,
(b)). That is, the seller chooses to trade at low price at either
states, and the buyer always chooses the no trade option that
fines the seller, if the second stage is reached. Such buyer"s
threat is not credible, because if the mechanism is played
only once, and Stage 2 is reached in state H, the buyer would
strictly decrease his payoff if he chooses (b). Clearly, this is
not a subgame perfect equilibrium. Although each extensive
game-form is strategically equivalent to a normal form one,
the extensive form representation places more structure and
so it seems plausible that the subgame perfect equilibrium
will be played.9
7
Formally, this goal is not Maskin monotonic, a necessary
condition for Nash-implementability [24].
8
A similar argument applies for the Fair Assignment 
Problem.
9
Interestingly, it is a straight forward to construct a 
sequential mechanism with unique SPE, and additional NE with a
strictly larger payoff for every player.
