In this paper we have seen a new partial informational
assumption, and we have demonstrated its suitability to
networks in which computational agents can easily collect
and distribute information. We then described some 
mechanisms using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly
dominated strategies. Some issues for future work include:
• As we have seen, the implementation issue in p-informed
environments is straightforward - it is easy to construct
incentive compatible mechanisms even for 
non-singleparameter cases. The challenge is to find more realistic
scenarios in which the partial informational 
assumption is applicable.
• Mechanisms for information propagation and 
maintenance. In our examples we choose p such that the
maintenance cost over time is negligible. However,
the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent
can use the recorded information to eliminate data
that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease
his maintenance costs. As a result, the probability
that the environment is informed decreases, and 
selfish agents would not cooperate. Incentives for 
information propagation should be considered as well (e.g.,
for P2P networks for file sharing).
• It seems that some social choice goals cannot be 
implemented if each player is at least 1/n-malicious (where
n is the number of players). It would be interesting to
identify these cases.
