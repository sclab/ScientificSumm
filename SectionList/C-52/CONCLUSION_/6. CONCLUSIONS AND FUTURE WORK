In distributed multi-player games played across the Internet, 
object and player trajectory within the game space are exchanged in
terms of DR vectors. Due to the variable delay between players,
these DR vectors reach different players at different times. There is
unfair advantage gained by receivers who are closer to the sender
of the DR as they are able to render the sender"s position more
accurately in real time. In this paper, we first developed a model
for estimating the error in rendering player trajectories at the 
receivers. We then presented an algorithm based on scheduling the
DR vectors to be sent to different players at different times thereby
equalizing the error at different players. This algorithm is aimed
at making the game fair to all players, but tends to increase the
mean error of the players. To counter this effect, we presented
budget based algorithms where the DR vectors are still 
scheduled to be sent at different players at different times but the 
algorithm balances the need for fairness with the requirement that the
error of the worst case players (who are furthest from the sender)
are not increased compared to the base case (where all DR vectors
are sent to all players every time a DR vector is generated). We 
presented two variations of the budget based algorithms and through
experimentation showed that the algorithms reduce the standard 
deviation of the error thereby making the game more fair and at the
same time has comparable mean error to the base case.
