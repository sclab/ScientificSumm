Although many information retrieval systems (e.g., web search
engines and digital library systems) have been successfully deployed,
the current retrieval systems are far from optimal. A major 
deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user
modeling and are not adaptive to individual users [17]. This 
inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases:
(1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to
search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or
the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the
same results for these users. Without considering the actual user, it
is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2)
A user"s information needs may change over time. The same user
may use Java sometimes to mean the Java island in Indonesia
and some other times to mean the programming language. 
Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to
recognize the correct sense.
In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model
the user appropriately and personalize search according to each 
individual user. The major goal of user modeling for information
retrieval is to accurately model a user"s information need, which is,
unfortunately, a very difficult task. Indeed, it is even hard for a user
to precisely describe what his/her information need is.
What information is available for a system to infer a user"s 
information need? Obviously, the user"s query provides the most direct
evidence. Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on
the query to model a user"s information need. However, since a
query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based
on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished . An effective way
to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user
to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for
satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user 
modeling based on such examples of relevant documents. This is called
relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for
improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20]. Unfortunately, in real world
applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to
provide relevant examples for feedback [11].
It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a user"s 
information need based on any implicit feedback information, which
naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require
any extra user effort. Indeed, several previous studies have shown
that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy. In [3],
a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a user"s
explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and
browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time,
mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).
It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling
on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong
correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that 
implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.
In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn
a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking
of search results that suits a group of users" preferences. In [25],
the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited
through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy.

While a user may have general long term interests and 
preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to
satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short
period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user
would generally no longer be interested in such information. For
example, a user may be looking for information about used cars
in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is
generally no longer interested in such information. In such cases,
implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time
is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and
feedback information, such as which of the search results for the
current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much
more useful. Consider the query Java again. Any of the 
following immediate feedback information about the user could 
potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query:
(1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as 
opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user
viewed a page where words such as programming, software,
and applet occur many times.
To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate
and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been
well addressed in the previous work. In this paper, we study how to
construct and update a user model based on the immediate search
context and implicit feedback information and use the model to 
improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval. In order to maximally 
benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling,
we propose to perform eager implicit feedback. That is, as soon
as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would
update the system"s belief about the user"s information need and
respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user
model. We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing
interactive information retrieval based on eager user model 
updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by
choosing a system action to optimize a utility function. In a 
traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query
with documents and rank documents according to their relevance
values. As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent
cycle of query and result display. In the proposed new retrieval
paradigm, the user"s search context plays an important role and the
inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the
user. The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different
from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.
We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two
types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related 
immediately preceding query and using the query and the 
corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current
query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to 
immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the
user. Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search
agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on
top of a popular search engine (Google). Experiments on web
search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over
Google. Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally
exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any
extra effort. Thus the developed search agent can improve existing
web search performance without additional effort from the user.
The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section 2,
we discuss the related work. In Section 3, we present a 
decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.
In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an 
intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager
implicit feedback. In Section 5, we report our experiment results
using the search agent. Section 6 concludes our work.
