Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been 
studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work
in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of 
immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query
and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous
work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback 
information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of
implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback 
information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits 
longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework
to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval 
process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling
separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval 
models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with
documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a 
personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing
work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.
Currently some search engines provide rudimentary 
personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows
users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from 
predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are
brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users
the option to save web sites they like and block those they 
dislike. In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit
user modeling without any additional user efforts. Furthermore, the
personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side. There are
two remarkable advantages on this. First, the user does not need to
worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for
personalized search [26]. Second, both the computation of 
personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client
side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].
There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or
query dynamics [13]. UCAIR makes direct use of a user"s query
history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search
session. UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries 
belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from
the previous query to perform query expansion.
Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query 
expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand
the query, we use user"s implicit feedback information to expand
the current query. These two techniques may be combined.
