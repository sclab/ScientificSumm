In this paper, we address the rank aggregation problem
where different, but not disjoint, lists of documents are to
be fused. We noticed that the input rankings can hide ties,
so they should not be considered as complete orders. Only
robust information should be used from each input ranking.
Current rank aggregation methods, and especially 
positional methods (e.g. combSUM [15]), are not initially 
designed to work with such rankings. They should be adapted
by considering specific working assumptions.
We propose a new outranking method for rank 
aggregation which is well adapted to the IR context. Indeed, it
ranks two documents w.r.t. the intensity of their positions
difference in each input ranking and also considering the
number of the input rankings that are concordant and 
discordant in favor of a specific document. There is also no
need to make specific assumptions on the positions of the
missing documents. This is an important feature since the
absence of a document from a ranking should not be 
necessarily interpreted negatively.
Experimental results show that the outranking method
significantly out-performs popular classical positional data
fusion methods like combSUM and combMNZ strategies. It
also out-performs a good performing majoritarian methods
which is the Markov chain method. These results are tested
against different test collections and queries. From the 
experiments, we can also conclude that in order to improve the
performances, we should fuse result lists of well performing
IR models, and that majoritarian data fusion methods 
perform better than positional methods.
The proposed method can have a real impact on Web
metasearch performances since only ranks are available from
most primary search engines, whereas most of the current
approaches need scores to merge result lists into one single
list.
Further work involves investigating whether the 
outranking approach performs well in various other contexts, e.g.
using the document scores or some combination of 
document ranks and scores.
