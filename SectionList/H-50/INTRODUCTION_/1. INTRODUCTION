A wide range of current Information Retrieval (IR) 
approaches are based on various search models (Boolean, 
Vector Space, Probabilistic, Language, etc. [2]) in order to 
retrieve relevant documents in response to a user request. The
result lists produced by these approaches depend on the 
exact definition of the relevance concept.
Rank aggregation approaches, also called data fusion 
approaches, consist in combining these result lists in order
to produce a new and hopefully better ranking. Such 
approaches give rise to metasearch engines in the Web context.
We consider, in the following, cases where only ranks are
available and no other additional information is provided
such as the relevance scores. This corresponds indeed to the
reality, where only ordinal information is available.
Data fusion is also relevant in other contexts, such as when
the user writes several queries of his/her information need
(e.g., a boolean query and a natural language query) [4], or
when many document surrogates are available [16].
Several studies argued that rank aggregation has the 
potential of combining effectively all the various sources of 
evidence considered in various input methods. For instance,
experiments carried out in [16], [30], [4] and [19] showed that
documents which appear in the lists of the majority of the
input methods are more likely to be relevant. Moreover, Lee
[19] and Vogt and Cottrell [31] found that various retrieval
approaches often return very different irrelevant documents,
but many of the same relevant documents. Bartell et al.
[3] also found that rank aggregation methods improve the
performances w.r.t. those of the input methods, even when
some of them have weak individual performances. These
methods also tend to smooth out biases of the input 
methods according to Montague and Aslam [22]. Data fusion has
recently been proved to improve performances for both the
ad-hoc retrieval and categorization tasks within the TREC
genomics track in 2005 [1].
The rank aggregation problem was addressed in various
fields such as i) in social choice theory which studies 
voting algorithms which specify winners of elections or winners
of competitions in tournaments [29], ii) in statistics when
studying correlation between rankings, iii) in distributed
databases when results from different databases must be
combined [12], and iv) in collaborative filtering [23].
Most current rank aggregation methods consider each 
input ranking as a permutation over the same set of items.
They also give rigid interpretation to the exact ranking of
the items. Both of these assumptions are rather not valid in
the IR context, as will be shown in the following sections.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We
first review current rank aggregation methods in Section 2.
Then we outline the specificities of the data fusion problem
in the IR context (Section 3). In Section 4, we present a
new aggregation method which is proven to best fit the IR
context. Experimental results are presented in Section 5 and
conclusions are provided in a final section.
