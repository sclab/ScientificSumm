AGGREGATION PROBLEM IN THE IR CONTEXT
3.1 Limited Significance of the Rankings
The exact positions of documents in one input ranking
have limited significance and should not be overemphasized.
For instance, having three relevant documents in the first
three positions, any perturbation of these three items will
have the same value. Indeed, in the IR context, the complete
order provided by an input method may hide ties. In this
case, we call such rankings semi orders. This was outlined in
[13] as the problem of aggregation with ties. It is therefore
important to build the consensus ranking based on robust
information:
• Documents with near positions in j are more likely
to have similar interest or relevance. Thus a slight
perturbation of the initial ranking is meaningless.
• Assuming that document di is better ranked than 
document di in a ranking j, di is more likely to be 
definitively more relevant than di in j when the number
of intermediate positions between di and di increases.
3.2 Partial Lists
In real world applications, such as metasearch engines,
rankings provided by the input methods are often partial
lists. This was outlined in [14] as the problem of having to
merge top-k results from various input lists. For instance,
in the experiments carried out by Dwork et al. [11], authors
found that among the top 100 best documents of 7 input
search engines, 67% of the documents were present in only
one search engine, whereas less than two documents were
present in all the search engines.
Rank aggregation of partial lists raises four major 
difficulties which we state hereafter, proposing for each of them
various working assumptions:
1. Partial lists can have various lengths, which can favour
long lists. We thus consider the following two working
hypotheses:
H1
k : We only consider the top k best documents from
each input ranking.
H1
all: We consider all the documents from each input
ranking.
2. Since there are different documents in the input 
rankings, we must decide which documents should be kept
in the consensus ranking. Two working hypotheses are
therefore considered:
H2
k : We only consider documents which are present in
at least k input rankings (k > 1).
H2
all: We consider all the documents which are ranked
in at least one input ranking.
Hereafter, we call documents which will be retained
in the consensus ranking, candidate documents, and
documents that will be excluded from the consensus
ranking, excluded documents. We also call a candidate
document which is missing in one or more rankings, a
missing document.
3. Some candidate documents are missing documents in
some input rankings. Main reasons for a missing 
document are that it was not indexed or it was indexed
but deemed irrelevant ; usually this information is not
available. We consider the following two working 
hypotheses:
H3
yes: Each missing document in each j is assigned
a position.
H3
no: No assumption is made, that is each missing 
document is considered neither better nor worse than any
other document.
4. When assumption H2
k holds, each input ranking may
contain documents which will not be considered in the
consensus ranking. Regarding the positions of the 
candidate documents, we can consider the following 
working hypotheses:
H4
init: The initial positions of candidate documents
are kept in each input ranking.
H4
new: Candidate documents receive new positions in
each input ranking, after discarding excluded ones.
In the IR context, rank aggregation methods need to 
decide more or less explicitly which assumptions to retain
w.r.t. the above-mentioned difficulties.
