AGGREGATION
4.1 Presentation
Positional methods consider implicitly that the positions
of the documents in the input rankings are scores giving thus
a cardinal meaning to an ordinal information. This 
constitutes a strong assumption that is questionable, especially
when the input rankings have different lengths. Moreover,
for positional methods, assumptions H3
and H4
, which are
often arbitrary, have a strong impact on the results. For
instance, let us consider an input ranking of 500 documents
out of 1000 candidate documents. Whether we assign to
each of the missing documents the position 1, 501, 750 or
1000 -corresponding to variations of H3
yes- will give rise to
very contrasted results, especially regarding the top of the
consensus ranking.
Majoritarian methods do not suffer from the 
above-mentioned drawbacks of the positional methods since they build
consensus rankings exploiting only ordinal information 
contained in the input rankings. Nevertheless, they suppose
that such rankings are complete orders, ignoring that they
may hide ties. Therefore, majoritarian methods base 
consensus rankings on illusory discriminant information rather
than less discriminant but more robust information.
Trying to overcome the limits of current rank aggregation
methods, we found that outranking approaches, which were
initially used for multiple criteria aggregation problems [26],
can also be used for the rank aggregation purpose, where
each ranking plays the role of a criterion. Therefore, in
order to decide whether a document di should be ranked
better than di in the consensus ranking σ, the two following
conditions should be met:
• a concordance condition which ensures that a 
majority of the input rankings are concordant with diσdi
(majority principle).
• a discordance condition which ensures that none of the
discordant input rankings strongly refutes dσd 
(respect of minorities principle).
Formally, the concordance coalition with diσdi is
Csp (diσdi ) = { j∈ PR : rj
i ≤ rj
i − sp}
where sp is a preference threshold which is the variation
of document positions -whether it is absolute or relative to
the ranking length- which draws the boundaries between an
indifference and a preference situation between documents.
The discordance coalition with diσdi is
Dsv (diσdi ) = { j∈ PR : rj
i ≥ rj
i + sv}
where sv is a veto threshold which is the variation of 
document positions -whether it is absolute or relative to the
ranking length- which draws the boundaries between a weak
and a strong opposition to diσdi .
Depending on the exact definition of the preceding 
concordance and discordance coalitions leading to the definition
of some decision rules, several outranking relations can be
defined. They can be more or less demanding depending on
i) the values of the thresholds sp and sv, ii) the importance
or minimal size cmin required for the concordance coalition,
and iii) the importance or maximum size dmax of the 
discordance coalition.
A generic outranking relation can thus be defined as 
follows:
diS(sp,sv,cmin,dmax)di ⇔ |Csp (diσdi )| ≥ cmin
AND |Dsv (diσdi )| ≤ dmax
This expression defines a family of nested outranking 
relations since S(sp,sv,cmin,dmax) ⊆ S(sp,sv,cmin,dmax) when
cmin ≥ cmin and/or dmax ≤ dmax and/or sp ≥ sp and/or
sv ≤ sv. This expression also generalizes the majority rule
which corresponds to the particular relation S(0,∞, n
2
,n). It
also satisfies important properties of rank aggregation 
methods, called neutrality, Pareto-optimality, Condorcet 
property and Extended Condorcet property, in the social choice
literature [29].
Outranking relations are not necessarily transitive and do
not necessarily correspond to rankings since directed cycles
may exist. Therefore, we need specific procedures in order to
derive a consensus ranking. We propose the following 
procedure which finds its roots in [27]. It consists in partitioning
the set of documents into r ranked classes.
Each class Ch contains documents with the same relevance
and results from the application of all relations (if possible)
to the set of documents remaining after previous classes are
computed. Documents within the same equivalence class are
ranked arbitrarily.
Formally, let
• R be the set of candidate documents for a query,
• S1
, S2
, . . . be a family of nested outranking relations,
• Fk(di, E) = |{di ∈ E : diSk
di }| be the number of
documents in E(E ⊆ R) that could be considered
‘worse" than di according to relation Sk
,
• fk(di, E) = |{di ∈ E : di Sk
di}| be the number of
documents in E that could be considered ‘better" than
di according to Sk
,
• sk(di, E) = Fk(di, E) − fk(di, E) be the qualification
of di in E according to Sk
.
Each class Ch results from a distillation process. It 
corresponds to the last distillate of a series of sets E0 ⊇ E1 ⊇ . . .
where E0 = R \ (C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Ch−1) and Ek is a reduced 
subset of Ek−1 resulting from the application of the following
procedure:
1. compute for each di ∈ Ek−1 its qualification according
to Sk
, i.e. sk(di, Ek−1),
2. define smax = maxdi∈Ek−1 {sk(di, Ek−1)}, then
3. Ek = {di ∈ Ek−1 : sk(di, Ek−1) = smax}
When one outranking relation is used, the distillation 
process stops after the first application of the previous 
procedure, i.e., Ch corresponds to distillate E1. When different
outranking relations are used, the distillation process stops
when all the pre-defined outranking relations have been used
or when |Ek| = 1.
4.2 Illustrative Example
This section illustrates the concepts and procedures of
section 4.1. Let us consider a set of candidate documents
R = {d1, d2, d3, d4, d5}. The following table gives a profile
PR of different rankings of the documents of R: PR = ( 1
, 2, 3, 4).

d1 1 3 1 5
d2 2 1 3 3
d3 3 2 2 1
d4 4 4 5 2
d5 5 5 4 4
Let us suppose that the preference and veto thresholds
are set to values 1 and 4 respectively, and that the 
concordance and discordance thresholds are set to values 2 and 1
respectively. The following tables give the concordance, 
discordance and outranking matrices. Each entry csp (di, di )
(dsv (di, di )) in the concordance (discordance) matrix gives
the number of rankings that are concordant (discordant)
with diσdi , i.e. csp (di, di ) = |Csp (diσdi )| and dsv (di, di ) =
|Dsv (diσdi )|.

0Outranking Matrix (S1)
For instance, the concordance coalition for the assertion
d1σd4 is C1(d1σd4) = { 1, 2, 3} and the discordance
coalition for the same assertion is D4(d1σd4) = ∅. 
Therefore, c1(d1, d4) = 3, d4(d1, d4) = 0 and d1S1
d4 holds.
Notice that Fk(di, R) (fk(di, R)) is given by summing the
values of the ith
row (column) of the outranking matrix. The
consensus ranking is obtained as follows: to get the first class
C1, we compute the qualifications of all the documents of
E0 = R with respect to S1
. They are respectively 2, 2, 2, -2
and -4. Therefore smax equals 2 and C1 = E1 = {d1, d2, d3}.
Observe that, if we had used a second outranking relation
S2(⊇ S1), these three documents could have been 
possibly discriminated. At this stage, we remove documents of
C1 from the outranking matrix and compute the next class
C2: we compute the new qualifications of the documents of
E0 = R \ C1 = {d4, d5}. They are respectively 1 and -1. So
C3 = E1 = {d4}. The last document d5 is the only 
document of the last class C3. Thus, the consensus ranking is
{d1, d2, d3} → {d4} → {d5}.
