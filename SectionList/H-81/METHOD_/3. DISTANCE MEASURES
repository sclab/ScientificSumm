The distance measures used in this work have been collected from
various areas (Subsection 3.1). Because they work on differently
quantised data, Subsection 3.2 sketches a model for unification on
the basis of quantitative descriptions. Finally, Subsection 3.3
introduces the distance measures as well as their origin and the
idea they implement.
3.1 Sources
Distance measurement is used in many research areas such as
psychology, sociology (e.g. comparing test results), medicine (e.g.
comparing parameters of test persons), economics (e.g. comparing
balance sheet ratios), etc. Naturally, the character of data available
in these areas differs significantly. Essentially, there are two
extreme cases of data vectors (and distance measures): 
predicatebased (all vector elements are binary, e.g. {0, 1}) and quantitative
(all vector elements are continuous, e.g. [0, 1]).
Predicates express the existence of properties and represent 
highlevel information while quantitative values can be used to measure
and mostly represent low-level information. Predicates are often
employed in psychology, sociology and other human-related
sciences and most predicate-based distance measures were
therefore developed in these areas. Descriptions in visual
information retrieval are nearly ever (if they do not integrate
semantic information) quantitative. Consequently, mostly
quantitative distance measures are used in visual information
retrieval.
The goal of this work is to compare the MPEG-7 distance
measures with the most powerful distance measures developed in
other areas. Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative
but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined
exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the
application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative
data. The model developed for this purpose is presented in the
next section.
3.2 Quantisation model
The goal of the quantisation model is to redefine the set operators
that are usually used in predicate-based distance measures on
continuous data. The first in visual information retrieval to follow
this approach were Santini and Jain, who tried to apply Tversky's
Feature Contrast Model [17] to content-based image retrieval
[12], [13]. They interpreted continuous data as fuzzy predicates
and used fuzzy set operators. Unfortunately, their model suffered
from several shortcomings they described in [12], [13] (for
example, the quantitative model worked only for one specific
version of the original predicate-based measure).
The main idea of the presented quantisation model is that set
operators are replaced by statistical functions. In [5] the authors
could show that this interpretation of set operators is reasonable.
The model offers a solution for the descriptors considered in the
evaluation. It is not specific to one distance measure, but can be
applied to any predicate-based measure. Below, it will be shown
that the model does not only work for predicate data but for
quantitative data as well. Each measure implementing the model
can be used as a substitute for the original predicate-based measure.
Generally, binary properties of two objects (e.g. media objects)
can exist in both objects (denoted as a), in just one (b, c) or in
none of them (d). The operator needed for these relationships are
UNION, MINUS and NOT. In the quantisation model they are
replaced as follows (see [5] for further details).

a selects properties that are present in both data vectors (Xi, Xj
representing media objects), b and c select properties that are
present in just one of them and d selects properties that are present
in neither of the two data vectors. Every property is selected by
the extent to which it is present (a and d: mean, b and c:
difference) and only if the amount to which it is present exceeds a
certain threshold (depending on the mean and standard deviation
over all elements of descriptor space).
The implementation of these operators is based on one assumption.
It is assumed that vector elements measure on interval scale. That
means, each element expresses that the measured property is
"more or less" present ("0": not at all, "M": fully present). This is
true for most visual descriptors and all MPEG-7 descriptors. A
natural origin as it is assumed here ("0") is not needed.
Introducing p (called discriminance-defining parameter) for the
thresholds 21 ,εε has the positive consequence that a, b, c, d can
then be controlled through a single parameter. p is an additional
criterion for the behaviour of a distance measure and determines
the thresholds used in the operators. It expresses how accurate
data items are present (quantisation) and consequently, how
accurate they should be investigated. p can be set by the user or
automatically. Interesting are the limits:
1. Mp →⇒∞→ 21 ,εε
In this case, all elements (=properties) are assumed to be
continuous (high quantisation). In consequence, all properties of a
descriptor are used by the operators. Then, the distance measure is
not discriminant for properties.
2. 0,0 21 →⇒→ εεp
In this case, all properties are assumed to be predicates. In
consequence, only binary elements (=predicates) are used by the
operators (1-bit quantisation). The distance measure is then highly
discriminant for properties.
Between these limits, a distance measure that uses the
quantisation model is - depending on p - more or less
discriminant for properties. This means, it selects a subset of all
available description vector elements for distance measurement.
For both predicate data and quantitative data it can be shown that
the quantisation model is reasonable. If description vectors consist
of binary elements only, p should be used as follows (for example,
p can easily be set automatically):
( )σµεε ,min..,0,0 21 ==⇒→ pgep
In this case, a, b, c, d measure like the set operators they replace.
For example, Table 1 shows their behaviour for two 
onedimensional feature vectors Xi and Xj. As can be seen, the
statistical measures work like set operators. Actually, the
quantisation model works accurate on predicate data for any p≠∞.
To show that the model is reasonable for quantitative data the
following fact is used. It is easy to show that for predicate data
some quantitative distance measures degenerate to 
predicatebased measures. For example, the L1
metric (Manhattan metric)
degenerates to the Hamming distance (from [9], without weights):
distanceHammingcbxxL
k
jkik =+≡−= ∑1
If it can be shown that the quantisation model is able to
reconstruct the quantitative measure from the degenerated
predicate-based measure, the model is obviously able to extend
predicate-based measures to the quantitative domain. This is easy
to illustrate. For purely quantitative feature vectors, p should be
used as follows (again, p can easily be set automatically):
1, 21 =⇒∞→ εεp
Then, a and d become continuous functions:

This means, for sufficiently high p every predicate-based distance
measure that is either not using b and c or just as b+c, b-c or c-b,
can be transformed into a continuous quantitative distance

The quantisation model successfully reconstructs the L1
metric
and no distance measure-specific modification has to be made to
the model. This demonstrates that the model is reasonable. In the
following it will be used to extend successful predicate-based
distance measures on the quantitative domain.
The major advantages of the quantisation model are: (1) it is
application domain independent, (2) the implementation is
straightforward, (3) the model is easy to use and finally, (4) the
new parameter p allows to control the similarity measurement
process in a new way (discriminance on property level).
3.3 Implemented measures
For the evaluation described in this work next to predicate-based
(based on the quantisation model) and quantitative measures, the
distance measures recommended in the MPEG-7 standard were
implemented (all together 38 different distance measures).
Table 2 summarises those predicate-based measures that
performed best in the evaluation (in sum 20 predicate-based
measures were investigated). For these measures, K is the number
of predicates in the data vectors Xi and Xj. In P1, the sum is used
for Tversky's f() (as Tversky himself does in [17]) and α, β are
weights for element b and c. In [5] the author's investigated
Tversky's Feature Contrast Model and found α=1, β=0 to be the
optimum parameters.
Some of the predicate-based measures are very simple (e.g. P2,
P4) but have been heavily exploited in psychological research.
Pattern difference (P6) - a very powerful measure - is used in the
statistics package SPSS for cluster analysis. P7 is a correlation
coefficient for predicates developed by Pearson.
Table 3 shows the best quantitative distance measures that were
used. Q1 and Q2 are metric-based and were implemented as
representatives for the entire group of Minkowski distances. The
wi are weights. In Q5, ii σµ , are mean and standard deviation
for the elements of descriptor Xi. In Q6, m is
2
M
(=0.5). Q3, the
Canberra metric, is a normalised form of Q1. Similarly, Q4,
Clark's divergence coefficient is a normalised version of Q2. Q6 is
a further-developed correlation coefficient that is invariant against
sign changes. This measure is used even though its particular
properties are of minor importance for this application domain.
Finally, Q8 is a measure that takes the differences between
adjacent vector elements into account. This makes it structurally
different from all other measures.
Obviously, one important distance measure is missing. The
Mahalanobis distance was not considered, because different
descriptors would require different covariance matrices and for
some descriptors it is simply impossible to define a covariance
matrix. If the identity matrix was used in this case, the
Mahalanobis distance would degenerate to a Minkowski distance.
Additionally, the recommended MPEG-7 distances were
implemented with the following parameters: In the distance
measure of the Color Layout descriptor all weights were set to "1"
(as in all other implemented measures). In the distance measure of
the Dominant Color descriptor the following parameters were
used: 20,1,3.0,7.0 21 ==== dTww α (as recommended). In the
Homogeneous Texture descriptor's distance all ( )kα were set to
"1" and matching was done rotation- and scale-invariant.
Important! Some of the measures presented in this section are
distance measures while others are similarity measures. For the
tests, it is important to notice, that all similarity measures were
inverted to distance measures.
