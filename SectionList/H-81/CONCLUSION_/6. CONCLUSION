The evaluation presented in this paper aims at testing the
recommended distance measures and finding better ones for the
basic visual MPEG-7 descriptors. Eight descriptors were selected,
38 distance measures were implemented, media collections were
created and assessed, performance indicators were defined and
more than 22500 tests were performed. To be able to use
predicate-based distance measures next to quantitative measures a
quantisation model was defined that allows the application of
predicate-based measures on continuous data.
In the evaluation the best overall distance measures for visual
content - as extracted by the visual MPEG-7 descriptors - turned
out to be the pattern difference measure and the Meehl index (for
homogeneous descriptions). Since these two measures perform
significantly better than the MPEG-7 recommendations they
should be further tested on large collections of image and video
content (e.g. from [15]).
The choice of the right distance function for similarity
measurement depends on the descriptor, the queried media
collection and the semantic level of the user's idea of similarity.
This work offers suitable distance measures for various situations.
In consequence, the distance measures identified as the best will
be implemented in the open MPEG-7 based visual information
retrieval framework VizIR [4].
