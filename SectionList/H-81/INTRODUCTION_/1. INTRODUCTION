The MPEG-7 standard defines - among others - a set of
descriptors for visual media. Each descriptor consists of a feature
extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format)
and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different
kinds of media (e.g. on temporal media). The MPEG-7 descriptors
have been carefully designed to meet - partially 
complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing,
retrieval, etc. [9]. In the following, we will exclusively deal with
the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.
The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour,
texture, shape, motion and others (e.g. face description) and sum
up to 16 basic descriptors. For retrieval applications, a rule for
each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the
similarity of two descriptions. Common rules are distance
functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis
distance. Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include
distance measures in the normative part, because it was not
designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be)
retrieval-specific. However, the MPEG-7 authors give
recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular
descriptor. These recommendations are based on accurate
knowledge of the descriptors' behaviour and the description
structures.
In the present study a large number of successful distance
measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine,
social and economic sciences, etc.) were implemented and applied
on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the
recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for
any reasonable class of media objects. From the MPEG-7 tests
and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and
which distance measures have been tested on the visual
descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets. The hypothesis is that
analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but
only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance
measure for a specific feature extraction method.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives a minimum of
background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance
measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).
Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance
measures. Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test
data and the implemented evaluation methods. Finally, Section 5
presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors.
