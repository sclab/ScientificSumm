In the results presented below the first indicator from Subsection
4.2 was used to evaluate distance measures. In a first step
parameter p had to be set in a way that all measures are equally
discriminant. Distance measurement is fair if the following
condition holds true for any predicate-based measure dP and any
continuous measure dC:
( ) ( )CP dcppdcp ≈,
Then, it is guaranteed that predicate-based measures do not create
larger clusters (with a higher number of similar objects) for the
price of higher cluster pollution. In more than 1000 test queries
the optimum value was found to be p=1.
Results are organised as follows: Subsection 5.1 summarises the

best distance measures per descriptor, Section 5.2 shows the best
overall distance measures and Section 5.3 points out other
interesting results (for example, distance measures that work
particularly good on specific ground truth groups).
5.1 Best measure per descriptor
Figure 2 shows the evaluation results for the first indicator. For
each descriptor the best measure and the performance of the
MPEG-7 recommendation are shown. The results are aggregated
over the tested datasets.
On first sight, it becomes clear that the MPEG-7
recommendations are mostly relatively good but never the best.
For Color Layout the difference between MP7 and the best
measure, the Meehl index (Q8), is just 4% and the MPEG-7
measure has a smaller standard deviation. The reason why the
Meehl index is better may be that this descriptors generates
descriptions with elements that have very similar variance.
Statistical analysis confirmed that (see [6]).
For Color Structure, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture,
Region-based Shape and Scalable Color by far the best measure is
pattern difference (P6). Psychological research on human visual
perception has revealed that in many situation differences between
the query object and a candidate weigh much stronger than
common properties. The pattern difference measure implements
this insight in the most consequent way. In the author's opinion,
the reason why pattern difference performs so extremely well on
many descriptors is due to this fact. Additional advantages of
pattern difference are that it usually has a very low variance 
andbecause it is a predicate-based measure - its discriminance (and
cluster structure) can be tuned with parameter p.
The best measure for Dominant Color turned out to be Clark's
Divergence coefficient (Q4). This is a similar measure to pattern
difference on the continuous domain. The Texture Browsing
descriptor is a special problem. In the MPEG-7 standard it is
recommended to use it exclusively for browsing. After testing it
for retrieval on various distance measures the author supports this
opinion. It is very difficult to find a good distance measure for
Texture Browsing. The proposed Manhattan metric, for example,
performs very bad. The best measure is predicate-based (P7). It
works on common properties (a, d) but produces clusters with
very high cluster pollution. For this descriptor the second
indicator is up to eight times higher than for predicate-based
measures on other descriptors.
5.2 Best overall measures
Figure 3 summarises the results over all descriptors and media
collections. The diagram should give an indication on the general
potential of the investigated distance measures for visual
information retrieval.
It can be seen that the best overall measure is a predicate-based
one. The top performance of pattern difference (P6) proves that
the quantisation model is a reasonable method to extend
predicate-based distance measures on the continuous domain. The
second best group of measures are the MPEG-7
recommendations, which have a slightly higher mean but a lower
standard deviation than pattern difference. The third best measure
is the Meehl index (Q8), a measure developed for psychological
applications but because of its characteristic properties 
tailormade for certain (homogeneous) descriptors.
Minkowski metrics are also among the best measures: the average
mean and variance of the Manhattan metric (Q1) and the
Euclidean metric (Q2) are in the range of Q8. Of course, these
measures do not perform particularly well for any of the
descriptors. Remarkably for a predicate-based measure, Tversky's
Feature Contrast Model (P1) is also in the group of very good
measures (even though it is not among the best) that ends with
Q5, the correlation coefficient. The other measures either have a
significantly higher mean or a very large standard deviation.
5.3 Other interesting results
Distance measures that perform in average worse than others may
in certain situations (e.g. on specific content) still perform better.
For Color Layout, for example, Q7 is a very good measure on
colour photos. It performs as good as Q8 and has a lower standard
deviation. For artificial images the pattern difference and the
Hamming distance produce comparable results as well.
If colour information is available in media objects, pattern
difference performs well on Dominant Color (just 20% worse Q4)
and in case of difficult ground truth (group 5, 7, 10) the Meehl
index is as strong as P6.
