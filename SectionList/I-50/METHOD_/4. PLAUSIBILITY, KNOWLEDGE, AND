BELIEFS IN CTLKP
In this section we study some relevant properties of 
plausibility, knowledge, and beliefs; in particular, axioms KDT45
are examined. But first, we identify two important 
subclasses of models with plausibility.
A CTLKP model is plausibly serial (or p-serial) for agent
a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path 
according to a, i.e. on(Υa) = Q. As we will see further, a
weaker requirement is sometimes sufficient. We call a model
weakly p-serial if every state has at least one 
indistinguishable counterpart which lies on a plausible path, i.e. for each
q ∈ Q there is a q ∈ Q such that q ∼a q and q ∈ on(Υa).
Obviously, p-seriality implies weak p-seriality. We get the
following characterization of both model classes.
Proposition 4. M is plausibly serial for agent a iff 
formula Pl aE f is valid in M. M is weakly p-serial for agent
a iff ¬KaPl aA f⊥ is valid in M.
4.1 Axiomatic Properties
Theorem 5. Axioms K, D, 4, and 5 for knowledge are
strongly valid, and axiom T is valid. That is, modalities Ka
form system S5 in the sense of normal validity, and KD45
in the sense of strong validity.
We do not include proofs here due to lack of space. The
interested reader is referred to [2], where detailed proofs are
given.
Proposition 6. Axioms K, 4, and 5 for beliefs are
strongly valid. That is, we have:
|≡ (Baϕ ∧ Ba(ϕ → ψ)) → Baψ, |≡ (Baϕ → BaBaϕ), and
|≡ (¬Baϕ → Ba¬Baϕ).
The next proposition concerns the consistency axiom
D: Baϕ → ¬Ba¬ϕ. It is easy to see that the axiom is not
valid in general: as we have no restrictions on plausibility
sets Υa, it may be as well that Υa = ∅. In that case we have
Baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ, because the set of states to
be considered becomes empty. However, it turns out that D
is valid for a very natural class of models.
Proposition 7. Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the
class of all CTLKP models. However, it is strongly valid in
the class of weak p-serial models (and therefore also in the
class of p-serial models).
Moreover, as one may expect, beliefs do not have to be
always true.
Proposition 8. Axiom T for beliefs is not valid; i.e.,
|= (Baϕ → ϕ). The axiom is not even valid in the class of
p-serial models.
Theorem 9. Belief modalities Ba form system K45 in
the class of all models, and KD45 in the class of weakly
plausibly serial models (in the sense of both normal and
strong validity). Axiom T is not even valid for p-serial 
models.
4.2 Plausibility, Knowledge, and Beliefs
First, we investigate the relationship between knowledge
and plausibility/physicality operators. Then, we look at the
interaction between knowledge and beliefs.
Proposition 10. Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula, and M
be a CTLKP model. We have the following strong validities:
(i) |≡ Pl aKaϕ ↔ Kaϕ
(ii) |≡ Ph Kaϕ ↔ KaPh ϕ and |≡ KaPh ϕ ↔ Kaϕ
We now want to examine the relationship between 
knowledge and belief. For instance, if agent a believes in 
something, he knows that he believes it. Or, if he knows a fact,
he also believes that he knows it. On the other hand, for
instance, an agent does not necessarily believe in all the
things he knows. For example, we may know that an 
invasion from another galaxy is in principle possible (KaE♦
invasion), but if we do not take this possibility as plausible
(¬Pl aE♦ invasion), then we reject the corresponding belief
in consequence (¬BaE♦ invasion). Note that this property
reflects the strong connection between belief and plausibility
in our framework.
Proposition 11. The following formulae are strongly
valid:
(i) Baϕ → KaBaϕ, (ii) KaBaϕ → Baϕ,
(iii) Kaϕ → BaKaϕ.
The following formulae are not valid:
(iv) Baϕ → BaKaϕ, (v) Kaϕ → Baϕ
The last invalidity is especially important: it is not the
case that knowing something implies believing in it. This
emphasizes that we study a specific concept of beliefs here.
Note that its specific is not due to the plausibility-based 
definition of beliefs. The reason lies rather in the fact that we
investigate knowledge, beliefs and plausibility in a temporal
framework, as Proposition 12 shows.
Proposition 12. Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula that does
not include any temporal operators. Then Kaϕ → Baϕ is
strongly valid, and in the class of p-serial models we have
even that |≡ Kaϕ ↔ Baϕ.

Moreover, it is important that we use branching time with
explicit quantification over paths; this observation is 
formalized in Proposition 13.
Definition 1. We define the universal sublanguage of
CTLK in a way similar to [21]:
ϕu ::= p | ¬p | ϕu ∧ ϕu | ϕu ∨ ϕu | Aγu | Kaϕu,
γu ::= fϕu | 2 ϕu | ϕuU ϕu.
We call such ϕu universal formulae, and γu universal path
formulae.
Proposition 13. Let ϕu be a universal CTLK formula.
Then |≡ Kaϕu → Baϕu.
The following two theorems characterize the relationship
between knowledge and beliefs: first for the class of p-serial
models, and then, finally, for all models.
Theorem 14. The following formulae are strongly valid
in the class of plausibly serial CTLKP models:
(i) Baϕ ↔ KaPl aϕ, (ii) Kaϕ ↔ BaPh ϕ.
Theorem 15. Formula Baϕ ↔ KaPl a(E f → ϕ) is
strongly valid.
Note that this characterization has a strong commonsense
reading: believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in
all plausibly imaginable situations.
4.3 Properties of the Update
The first notable property of plausibility update is that it
influences only formulae in which plausibility plays a role,
i.e. ones in which belief or plausibility modalities occur.
Proposition 16. Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula that does
not include operators Pl a and Ba, and γ be a CTLKP path
formula. Then, we have |≡ ϕ ↔ (set-pla γ)ϕ.
What can be said about the result of an update? At first
sight, formula (set-pla γ)Pl aAγ seems a natural 
characterization; however, it is not valid. This is because, by leaving
the other (implausible) paths out of scope, we may leave out
of |γ| some paths that were needed to satisfy γ (see the 
example in Section 4.2). We propose two alternative ways out:
the first one restricts the language of the update similarly
to [21]; the other refers to physical possibilities, in a way
analogous to [13].
Proposition 17. The CTLKP formula (set-pla γ)Pl aAγ
is not valid. However, we have the following validities:
(i) |≡ (set-pla γu)Pl aAγu, where γu is a universal CTLK
path formula from Definition 1.
(ii) If ϕ, ϕ1, ϕ2 are arbitrary CTLK formulae, then:
|≡ (set-pla
fϕ)Pl aA f(Ph ϕ),
|≡ (set-pla 2 ϕ)Pl aA2 (Ph ϕ), and
|≡ (set-pla ϕ1U ϕ2)Pl aA(Ph ϕ1)U (Ph ϕ2).
