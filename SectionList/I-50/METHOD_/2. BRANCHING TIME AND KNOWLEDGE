In this paper we develop a framework for agents" beliefs
about how the world can (or must) evolve. Thus, we need a
notion of time and change, plus a notion of what the agents
are supposed to know in particular situations. CTLK [19]
is a straightforward combination of the computation tree
logic CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5].
CTL includes operators for temporal properties of 
systems: i.e., path quantifier E (there is a path), together
with temporal operators: f(in the next state), 2 
(always from now on) and U (until).1
Every occurrence of
a temporal operator is preceded by exactly one path 
quantifier in CTL (this variant of the language is sometimes called
vanilla CTL). Epistemic logic uses operators for 
representing agents" knowledge: Kaϕ is read as agent a knows
that ϕ.
Let Π be a set of atomic propositions with a typical 
element p, and Agt = {1, ..., k} be a set of agents with a typical
element a. The language of CTLK consists of formulae ϕ,
given as follows:
ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Kaϕ
γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.
We will sometimes refer to formulae ϕ as (vanilla) state
formulae and to formulae γ as (vanilla) path formulae.
The semantics of CTLK is based on Kripke models M =
Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π , which include a nonempty set of states
Q, a state transition relation R ⊆ Q × Q, epistemic 
indistinguishability relations ∼a⊆ Q × Q (one per agent), and a
valuation of propositions π : Π → P(Q). We assume that
relation R is serial and that all ∼a are equivalence relations.
A path λ in M refers to a possible behavior (or 
computation) of system M, and can be represented as an infinite
sequence of states that follow relation R, that is, a sequence
q0q1q2... such that qiRqi+1 for every i = 0, 1, 2, ... We 
denote the ith state in λ by λ[i]. The set of all paths in M
is denoted by ΛM (if the model is clear from context, M
will be omitted). A q-path is a path that starts from q,
i.e., λ[0] = q. A q-subpath is a sequence of states, starting
from q, which is a subpath of some path in the model, i.e.
a sequence q0q1... such that q = q0 and there are q0
, ..., qi
such that q0
...qi
q0q1... ∈ ΛM.2
The semantics of CTLK is
defined as follows:
M, q |= p iff q ∈ π(p);
M, q |= ¬ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ;
M, q |= ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |= ϕ and M, q |= ψ;
M, q |= E fϕ iff there is a q-path λ such that M, λ[1] |= ϕ;
M, q |= E2 ϕ iff there is a q-path λ such that M, λ[i] |= ϕ
for every i ≥ 0;

Additional operators A (for every path) and ♦ 
(sometime in the future) are defined in the usual way.

For CTLK models, λ is a q-subpath iff it is a q-path. It
will not always be so when plausible paths are introduced.
M, q |= EϕU ψ iff there is a q-path λ and i ≥ 0 such that
M, λ[i] |= ψ, and M, λ[j] |= ϕ for every 0 ≤ j < i;
M, q |= Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q .
