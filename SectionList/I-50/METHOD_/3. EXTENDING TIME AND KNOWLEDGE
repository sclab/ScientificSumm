WITH PLAUSIBILITY AND BELIEFS
In this section we discuss the central concept of this 
paper, i.e. the concept of plausibility. First, we outline the
idea informally. Then, we extend CTLK with the notion
of plausibility by adding plausible path operators Pl a and
physical path operator Ph to the logic. Formula Pl aϕ has
the intended meaning: according to agent a, it is plausible
that ϕ holds; formula Ph ϕ reads as: ϕ holds in all 
physically possible scenarios (i.e., even in implausible ones). The
plausible path operator restricts statements only to those
paths which are defined to be sensible, whereas the 
physical path operator generates statements about all paths that
may theoretically occur. Furthermore, we define beliefs on
top of plausibility and knowledge, as the facts that an agent
would know if he assumed that only plausible things could
happen. Finally, we discuss related work [7, 8, 20, 18, 16],
and compare it with our approach.
3.1 The Concept of Plausibility
It is well known how knowledge (or beliefs) can be 
modeled with Kripke structures. However, it is not so obvious
how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way
in one framework. Clearly, there should be a connection
between these two notions. Our approach is to use the 
notion of plausibility for this purpose. Plausibility can serve
as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics
of beliefs, in a similar way as indistinguishability of states
(represented by relation ∼a) is the semantic concept that
underlies knowledge. In this sense, our work follows [7, 20]:
essentially, beliefs are what an agent would know if he took
only plausible options into account. In our approach, 
however, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property.
That is, we do not consider states (or possible worlds) to be
more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors
to be plausible, and others implausible. Moreover, 
behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the
Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system.
An actual notion of plausibility (that is, a particular set of
plausible paths) can emerge in many different ways. It may
result from observations and learning; an agent can learn
from its observations and see specific patterns of events as
plausible (a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a
suit). Knowledge exchange is another possibility (e.g., an
agent a can tell agent b that player c always bluffs when he
is smiling). Game theory, with its rationality criteria 
(undominated strategies, maxmin, Nash equilibrium etc.) is 
another viable source of plausibility assumptions. Last but not
least, folk knowledge can be used to establish 
plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior (players normally want
to win a game, people want to live).
In any case, restricting the reasoning to plausible 
possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning 
feasible, as the space of all possibilities (we call them physical
possibilities in the rest of the paper) is exceedingly large in
real life. Of course, this does not exclude a more extensive
analysis in special cases, e.g. when our plausibility 
assumptions do not seem accurate any more, or when the cost of
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 583
inaccurate assumptions can be too high (as in the case of
high-budget business decisions). But even in these cases, we
usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely
- we only revise them to make them more cautious.3
To formalize this idea, we extend models of CTLK with
sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a,
physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the
language of CTLK. Now, it is possible to make statements
that refer to plausible paths only, as well as statements that
regard all paths that may occur in the system.
3.2 CTLK with Plausibility
In this section, we extend the logic of CTLK with 
plausibility; we call the resulting logic CTLKP. Formally, the
language of CTLKP is defined as:
ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Pl aϕ | Ph ϕ | Kaϕ | Baϕ
γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.
For instance, we may claim it is plausible to assume that
a shop is closed after the opening hours, though the manager
may be physically able to open it at any time: Pl aA2 (late →
¬open) ∧ Ph E♦ (late ∧ open).
The semantics of CTLKP extends that of CTLK as 
follows. Firstly, we augment the models with sets of plausible
paths. A model with plausibility is given as
M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π ,
where Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π is a CTLK model, and Υa ⊆ ΛM
is the set of paths in M that are plausible according to agent
a. If we want to make it clear that Υa is taken from model
M, we will write ΥM
a . It seems worth emphasizing that this
notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic. It is 
subjective because Υa represents agent a"s subjective view on what
is plausible - and indeed, different agents may have 
different ideas on plausibility (i.e., Υa may differ from Υb). It is
holistic because Υa represents agent a"s idea of the 
plausible behavior of the whole system (including the behavior of
other agents).
Remark 1. In our models, plausibility is also global, i.e.,
plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system.
Investigating systems, in which plausibility is relativized with
respect to states (like in [7]), might be an interesting avenue
of future work. However, such an approach - while obviously
more flexible - allows for potentially counterintuitive system
descriptions. For example, it might be the case that path λ
is plausible in q = λ[0], but the set of plausible paths in
q = λ[1] is empty. That is, by following plausible path λ we
are bound to get to an implausible situation. But then, does
it make sense to consider λ as plausible?
Secondly, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P ,
which we call plausible satisfaction. Let M be a CTLKP
3
That is, when planning to open an industrial plant in the
UK, we will probably consider the possibility of our main
contractor taking her life, but we will still not take into 
account the possibilities of: an invasion of UFO, England being
destroyed by a meteorite, Fidel Castro becoming the British
Prime Minister etc. Note that this is fundamentally different
from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely
scenarios are assigned very low probabilities: in that case,
they also have a very small influence on our final decision,
but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities
to evaluate the options.
model and P ⊆ ΛM be an arbitrary subset of paths in M
(not necessarily any ΥM
a ). |=P restricts the evaluation of
temporal formulae to the paths given in P only. The 
absolute satisfaction relation |= is defined as |=ΛM .
Let on(P) be the set of all states that lie on at least one
path in P, i.e. on(P) = {q ∈ Q | ∃λ ∈ P∃i (λ[i] = q)}. Now,
the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the 
following clauses:
M, q |=P p iff q ∈ π(p);
M, q |=P ¬ϕ iff M, q |=P ϕ;
M, q |=P ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, q |=P ϕ and M, q |=P ψ;
M, q |=P E fϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that
M, λ[1] |=P ϕ;
M, q |=P E2 ϕ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P such that
M, λ[i] |=P ϕ for every i ≥ 0;
M, q |=P EϕU ψ iff there is a q-subpath λ ∈ P and i ≥ 0
such that M, λ[i] |=P ψ, and M, λ[j] |=P ϕ for every
0 ≤ j < i;
M, q |=P Pl aϕ iff M, q |=Υa
ϕ;
M, q |=P Ph ϕ iff M, q |= ϕ;
M, q |=P Kaϕ iff M, q |= ϕ for every q such that q ∼a q ;
M, q |=P Baϕ iff for all q ∈ on(Υa) with q ∼a q , we have
that M, q |=Υa
ϕ.
One of the main reasons for using the concept of 
plausibility is that we want to define agents" beliefs out of more
primitive concepts - in our case, these are plausibility and
indistinguishability - in a way analogous to [20, 7]. If an
agent knows that ϕ, he must be sure about it. However,
beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts.
Still, they should make sense to the agent; if he believes that
ϕ, then the formula should at least hold in all futures that
he envisages as plausible. Thus, beliefs of an agent may be
seen as things known to him if he disregards all non-plausible
possibilities.
We say that ϕ is M-true (M |= ϕ) if M, q |= ϕ for all
q ∈ QM. ϕ is valid (|= ϕ) if M |= ϕ for all models M. ϕ
is M-strongly true (M |≡ ϕ) if M, q |=P ϕ for all q ∈ QM
and all P ⊆ ΛM. ϕ is strongly valid ( |≡ ϕ) if M |≡ ϕ for all
models M.
Proposition 2. Strong truth and strong validity imply
truth and validity, respectively. The reverse does not hold.
Ultimately, we are going to be interested in normal (not
strong) validity, as parameterizing the satisfaction relation
with a set P is just a technical device for propagating sets
of plausible paths Υa into the semantics of nested formulae.
The importance of strong validity, however, lies in the fact
that |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ makes ϕ and ψ completely interchangeable,
while the same is not true for normal validity.
Proposition 3. Let Φ[ϕ/ψ] denote formula Φ in which
every occurrence of ψ was replaced by ϕ. Also, let |≡ ϕ ↔ ψ.
Then for all M, q, P: M, q |=P Φ iff M, q |=P Φ[ϕ/ψ] (in
particular, M, q |= Φ iff M, q |= Φ[ϕ/ψ]).
Note that |= ϕ ↔ ψ does not even imply that M, q |= Φ iff
M, q |= Φ[ϕ/ψ].

Figure 1: Guessing Robots game
Example 1 (Guessing Robots). Consider a simple
game with two agents a and b, shown in Figure 1. First,
a chooses a real number r ∈ [0, 1] (without revealing the
number to b); then, b chooses a real number r ∈ [0, 1].
The agents win the game (and collect EUR 1, 000, 000) if
both chose 1, otherwise they lose. Formally, we model the
game with a CTLKP model M, in which the set of states
Q includes qs for the initial situation, states qr, r ∈ [0, 1],
for the situations after a has chosen number r, and final
states qw, ql for the winning and the losing situation, 
respectively. The transition relation is as follows: qsRqr and
qrRql for all r ∈ [0, 1]; q1Rqw, qwRqw, and qlRql. Moreover,
π(one) = {q1} and π(win) = {qw}. Player a has perfect 
information in the game (i.e., q ∼a q iff q = q ), but player
b does not distinguish between states qr (i.e., qr ∼b qr for
all r, r ∈ [0, 1]). Obviously, the only sensible thing to do
for both agents is to choose 1 (using game-theoretical 
vocabulary, these strategies are strongly dominant for the 
respective players). Thus, there is only one plausible course of
events if we assume that our players are rational, and hence
Υa = Υb = {qsq1qwqw . . .}.
Note that, in principle, the outcome of the game is 
uncertain: M, qs |= ¬A♦ win∧¬A2 ¬win. However, assuming 
rationality of the players makes it only plausible that the game
must end up with a win: M, qs |= Pla A♦ win ∧ Plb A♦ win,
and the agents believe that this will be the case: M, qs |=
BaA♦ win ∧ BbA♦ win. Note also that, in any of the states
qr, agent b believes that a (being rational) has played 1:
M, qr |= Bbone for all r ∈ [0, 1].
3.3 Defining Plausible Paths with Formulae
So far, we have assumed that sets of plausible paths are
somehow given in models. In this section we present a 
dynamic approach where an actual notion of plausibility can
be specified in the object language. Note that we want to
specify (usually infinite) sets of infinite paths, and we need a
finite representation of these structures. One logical solution
is given by using path formulae γ. These formulae describe
properties of paths; therefore, a specific formula can be used
to characterize a set of paths. For instance, think about a
country in Africa where it has never snowed. Then, 
plausible paths might be defined as ones in which it never snows,
i.e., all paths that satisfy 2 ¬snows. Formally, let γ be a
CTLK path formula. We define |γ|M to be the set of paths
that satisfy γ in model M:
| fϕ|M = {λ | M, λ[1] |= ϕ}
|2 ϕ|M = {λ | ∀i (M, λ[i] |= ϕ)}
|ϕ1U ϕ2|M = {λ | ∃i
`
M, λ[i] |= ϕ2 ∧
∀j(0 ≤ j < i ⇒ M, λ[j] |= ϕ1)
´
}.
Moreover, we define the plausible paths model update as
follows. Let M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υk, π be a
CTLKP model, and let P ⊆ ΛM be a set of paths. Then
Ma,P
= Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Υ1, ..., Υa−1, P, Υa+1, ..., Υk, π 
denotes model M with a"s set of plausible paths reset to P.
Now we can extend the language of CTLKP with 
formulae (set-pla γ)ϕ with the intuitive reading: suppose that
γ exactly characterizes the set of plausible paths, then ϕ
holds, and formal semantics given below:
M, q |=P (set-pla γ)ϕ iff Ma,|γ|M , q |=P ϕ.
We observe that this update scheme is similar to the one
proposed in [13].
3.4 Comparison to Related Work
Several modal notions of plausibility were already 
discussed in the existing literature [7, 8, 20, 18, 16]. In these
papers, like in ours, plausibility is used as a primitive 
semantic concept that helps to define beliefs on top of agents"
knowledge. A similar idea was introduced by Moses and
Shoham in [18]. Their work preceded both [7, 8] and 
[20]and although Moses and Shoham do not explicitly mention
the term plausibility, it seems appropriate to summarize
their idea first.
Moses and Shoham: Beliefs as Conditional Knowledge
In [18], beliefs are relativized with respect to a formula α
(which can be seen as a plausibility assumption expressed
in the object language). More precisely, worlds that satisfy α
can be considered as plausible. This concept is expressed via
symbols Bα
i ϕ; the index i ∈ {1, 2, 3} is used to distinguish
between three different implementations of beliefs. The first
version is given by Bα
1 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ).4
A drawback of
this version is that if α is false, then everything will be
believed with respect to α. The second version overcomes
this problem: Bα
2 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ) ∧ (K¬α → Kϕ); now ϕ is
only believed if it is known that ϕ follows from assumption
α, and ϕ must be known if assumption α is known to be false.
Finally, Bα
3 ϕ ≡ K(α → ϕ) ∧ ¬K¬α: if the assumption α is
known to be false, nothing should be believed with respect to
α. The strength of these different notions is given as follows:
Bα
3 ϕ implies Bα
2 ϕ, and Bα
2 ϕ implies Bα
1 ϕ. In this approach,
belief is strongly connected to knowledge in the sense that
belief is knowledge with respect to a given assumption.
Friedman and Halpern: Plausibility Spaces
The work of Friedman and Halpern [7] extends the concepts
of knowledge and belief with an explicit notion of 
plausibility; i.e., some worlds are more plausible for an agent
than others. To implement this idea, Kripke models are
extended with function P which assigns a plausibility space
P(q, a) = (Ω(q,a), (q,a)) to every state, or more generally
every possible world q, and agent a. The plausibility space
4
Unlike in most approaches, K is interpreted over all worlds
and not only over the indistinguishable worlds.
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 585
is just a partially ordered subset of states/worlds; that is,
Ω(q, a) ⊆ Q, and (q,a)⊆ Q ×Q is a reflexive and transitive
relation. Let S, T ⊆ Ω(q,a) be finite subsets of states; now,
T is defined to be plausible given S with respect to P(q, a),
denoted by S →P (q,a) T, iff all minimal points/states in
S (with respect to (q,a)) are also in T.5
Friedman and
Halpern"s view to modal plausibility is closely related to
probability and, more generally, plausibility measures. 
Logics of plausibility can be seen as a qualitative description of
agents preferences/knowledge; logics of probability [6, 15],
on the other hand, offer a quantitative description.
The logic from [7] is defined by the following grammar:
ϕ ::= p | ϕ∧ϕ | ¬ϕ | Kaϕ | ϕ →a ϕ, where the semantics of
all operators except →a is given as usual, and formulae ϕ →a
ψ have the meaning that ψ is true in the most plausible
worlds in which ϕ holds. Formally, the semantics for →a
is given as: M, q |= ϕ →a ψ iff Sϕ
P (q,a) →P(q,a)
Sψ
P (q,a),
where Sϕ
(q,a) = {q ∈ Ω(q,a) | M, q |= ϕ} are the states in
Ω(q,a) that satisfy ϕ. The idea of defining beliefs is given
by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he
knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of Ω(q,a);
formally, this can be stated as Baϕ ≡ Ka( →a ϕ).
Friedman and Halpern have shown that the KD45 
axioms are valid for operator Ba if plausibility spaces satisfy
consistency (for all states q ∈ Q it holds that Ω(q,a) ⊆ { q ∈
Q | q ∼a q }) and normality (for all states q ∈ Q it holds
that Ω(q,a) = ∅).6
A temporal extension of the language
(mentioned briefly in [7], and discussed in more detail in [8])
uses the interpreted systems approach [10, 5]. A system R
is given by runs, where a run r : N → Q is a function from
time moments (modeled by N) to global states, and a time
point (r, i) is given by a time point i ∈ N and a run r. A
global state is a combination of local states, one per agent.
An interpreted system M = (R, π) is given by a system R
and a valuation of propositions π. Epistemic relations are
defined over time points, i.e., (r , m ) ∼a (r, m) iff agent
a"s local states ra(m ) and ra(m) of (r , m ) and (r, m) are
equal. Formulae are interpreted in a straightforward way
with respect to interpreted systems, e.g. M, r, m |= Kaϕ iff
M, r , m |= ϕ for all (r , m ) ∼a (r, m). Now, these are time
points that play the role of possible worlds; consequently,
plausibility spaces P(r,m,a) are assigned to each point (r, m)
and agent a.
Su et al.: KBC Logic
Su et al. [20] have developed a multi-modal, 
computationally grounded logic with modalities K, B, and C (knowledge,
belief, and certainty). The computational model consists of
(global) states q = (qvis
, qinv
, qper
, Qpls
) where the 
environment is divided into a visible (qvis
) and an invisible part
(qinv
), and qper
captures the agent"s perception of the visible
part of the environment. External sources may provide the
agent with information about the invisible part of a state,
which results in a set of states Qpls
that are plausible for
the agent.
Given a global state q, we additionally define V is(q) =
qvis
, Inv(q) = qinv
, Per(q) = qper
, and Pls(q) = Qpls
. The

semantics is given by an extension of interpreted systems [10,
5], here, it is called interpreted KBC systems. KBC 
formulae are defined as ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Kϕ | Bϕ | Cϕ.
The epistemic relation ∼vis is captured in the following way:
(r, i) ∼vis (r , i ) iff V is(r(i)) = V is(r (i )). The semantic
clauses for belief and certainty are given below.
M, r, i |= Bϕ iff M, r , i |= ϕ for all (r , i ) with V is(r (i )) =
Per(r(i)) and Inv(r (i )) ∈ Pls(r(i))
M, r, i |= Cϕ iff M, r , i |= ϕ for all (r (i )) with V is(r (i )) =
Per(r(i))
Thus, an agent believes ϕ if, and only if, ϕ is true in all
states which look like what he sees now and seem plausible
in the current state. Certainty is stronger: if an agent is
certain about ϕ, the formula must hold in all states with
a visible part equal to the current perception, regardless of
whether the invisible part is plausible or not.
The logic does not include temporal formulae, although
it might be extended with temporal operators, as time is
already present in KBC models.
What Are the Differences to Our Logic?
In our approach, plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal
property, i.e., it is a property of temporal paths rather than
states. In the object language, this is reflected by the fact
that plausibility assumptions are specified through path 
formulae. In contrast, the approach of [18] and [20] is static:
not only the logics do not include operators for talking about
time and/or change, but these are states that are assumed
plausible or not in their semantics.
The differences to [7, 8] are more subtle. Firstly, the
framework of Friedman and Halpern is static in the sense
that plausibility is taken as a property of (abstract) 
possible worlds. This formulation is flexible enough to allow for
incorporating time; still, in our approach, time is inherent
to plausibility rather than incidental.
Secondly, our framework is more computationally oriented.
The implementation of temporal plausibility in [7, 8] is based
on the interpreted systems approach with time points (r, m)
being subject to plausibility. As runs are included in time
points, they can also be defined plausible or implausible.7
However, it also means that time points serve the role of
possible worlds in the basic formulation, which yields Kripke
structures with uncountable possible world spaces in all but
the most trivial cases.
Thirdly, [7, 8] build on linear time: a run (more precisely,
a time moment (r, m)) is fixed when a formula is interpreted.
In contrast, we use branching time with explicit 
quantification over temporal paths.8
We believe that branching time
is more suitable for non-deterministic domains (cf. e.g. [4]),
of which multi-agent systems are a prime example. Note
that branching time makes our notion of belief different from
Friedman and Halpern"s. Most notably, property Kϕ → Bϕ
is valid in their approach, but not in ours: an agent may
7
Friedman and Halpern even briefly mention how 
plausibility of runs can be embedded in their framework.
8
To be more precise, time in [7] does implicitly branch at
epistemic states. This is because (r, m) ∼a (r , m ) iff a"s
local state corresponding to both time points is the same
(ra(m) = ra(m )). In consequence, the semantics of Kaϕ
can be read as for every run, and every moment on this
run that yields the same local state as now, ϕ holds.
586 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
know that some course of events is in principle possible,
without believing that it can really become the case (see
Section 4.2). As Proposition 13 suggests, such a subtle 
distinction between knowledge and beliefs is possible in our
approach because branching time logics allow for existential
quantification over runs.
Fourthly, while Friedman and Halpern"s models are very
flexible, they also enable system descriptions that may seem
counterintuitive. Suppose that (r, m) is plausible in itself
(formally: (r, m) is minimal wrt (r,m,a)), but (r, m + 1) is
not plausible in (r, m + 1). This means that following the
plausible path makes it implausible (cf. Remark 1), which
is even stranger in the case of linear time. Combining the
argument with computational aspects, we suggest that our
approach can be more natural and straightforward for many
applications.
Last but not least, our logic provides a mechanism for
specifying (and updating) sets of plausible paths in the 
object language. Thus, plausibility sets can be specified in a
succinct way, which is another feature that makes our 
framework computation-friendly. The model checking results from
Section 5 are especially encouraging in this light.
