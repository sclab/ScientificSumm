In this paper a notion of plausible behavior is considered,
with the underlying idea that implausible options should be
usually ignored in practical reasoning about possible future
courses of action. We add the new notion of plausibility to
the logic of CTLK [19], and obtain a language which 
enables reasoning about what can (or must) plausibly happen.
As a technical device to define the semantics of the resulting
logic, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P that
allows to propagate the current set of plausible paths into
subformulae. Furthermore, we propose a non-standard 
notion of beliefs, defined in terms of indistinguishability and
plausibility. We also propose how plausibility assumptions
can be specified in the object language via a plausibility 
update operator (in a way similar to [13]).
We use this new framework to investigate some important
properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates.
In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality,
and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45
for the class of plausibly serial models. We also prove that
believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all 
plausibly possible situations. That is, the relationship between
knowledge and beliefs is very natural and reflects the 
initial intuition precisely. Moreover, the model checking 
results from Section 5 show that verification for CTLKP is
no more complex than for CTL and CTLK.
We would like to stress that we do not see this contribution
as a mere technical exercise in formal logic. Human agents
use a similar concept of plausibility and practical beliefs
in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search
space and make the reasoning feasible. As a consequence, we
suggest that the framework we propose may prove suitable
for modeling, design, and analysis resource-bounded agents
in general.
We would like to thank Juergen Dix for fruitful 
discussions, useful comments and improvements.
