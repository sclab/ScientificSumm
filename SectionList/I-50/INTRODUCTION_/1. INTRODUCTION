Notions like time, knowledge, and beliefs are very 
important for analyzing the behavior of agents and multi-agent
systems. In this paper, we extend modal logics of time and
knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior: this notion
is added to the language of CTLK [19], which is a 
straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic
CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5].
In our approach, plausibility can be seen as a temporal
property of behaviors. That is, some behaviors of the 
system can be assumed plausible and others implausible, with
the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be 
ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses
of action. Moreover, behaviors can be formally understood
as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a 
multiagent system. As a consequence, we obtain a language to
reason about what can (or must) plausibly happen. We
propose a particular notion of beliefs (inspired by [20, 7]),
defined in terms of epistemic relations and plausibility. The
main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would
know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen.
We believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility
and practical beliefs quite often in their everyday 
reasoning. Restricting one"s reasoning to plausible possibilities is
essential to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all
possibilities is exceedingly large in real life. We investigate
some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, and
belief in this new framework. In particular, we show that
knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy 
axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly
serial models. Finally, we show that the relationship 
between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is
natural and reflects the initial intuition well. We also show
how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object
language via a plausibility update operator, and we study
properties of such updates. Finally, we show that model
checking of the new logic is no more complex than model
checking CTL and CTLK.
Our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that 
allows the study of strategies, time, knowledge, and 
plausible/rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect 
information. As combining all these dimensions is highly 
nontrivial (cf. [12, 14]) it seems reasonable to split this task.
While this paper deals with knowledge, plausibility, and 
belief, the companion paper [11] proposes a general framework
for multi-agent systems that regard game-theoretical 
rationality criteria like Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality, etc.
The latter approach is based on the more powerful logic
ATL [1].
The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we briefly
present branching-time logic with knowledge, CTLK. In
Section 3 we present our approach to plausibility and 
formally define CTLK with plausibility. We also show how

temporal formulae can be used to describe plausible paths,
and we compare our logic with existing related work. In 
Section 4, properties of knowledge, belief, and plausibility are
explored. Finally, we present verification complexity results
for CTLKP in Section 5.
