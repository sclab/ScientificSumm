In this section, we present some theoretical results 
regarding the performance at Nash equilibrium under the infinite
parallelism model. We assume that the game is strongly
competitive to guarantee the existence of equilibria. For a
meaningful discussion of efficiency and fairness, we assume
that the users are symmetric by requiring that Xi = 1 andPn
j=1 wij = 1 for all the 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Or informally, we
require all the users have the same budget, and they have
the same utility when they own all the resources. This 
precludes the case when a user has an extremely high budget,
resulting in very low efficiency or low fairness at equilibrium.
We first provide a characterization of the equilibria. By
definition, the bidding vectors x1, . . . , xm is a Nash 
equilibrium if and only if each player"s strategy is the best 
response to the group"s bids. Since Ui is a linear function
and the domain of each users bids {(xi1, . . . , xin)|
P
j xij =
Xi , and xij ≥ 0} is a convex set, the optimality condition is
that there exists λi > 0 such that

= λi if xij > 0, and
< λi if xij = 0.

Or intuitively, at an equilibrium, each user has the same
marginal value on machines where they place positive bids
and has lower marginal values on those machines where they
do not bid.
Under the infinite parallelism model, it is easy to compute
the social optimum U∗
as it is achieved when we allocate
each machine wholly to the person who has the maximum
weight on the machine, i.e. U∗
=

j=1 max1≤i≤m wij.
3.1 Two-player Games
We first show that even in the simplest nontrivial case
when there are two users and two machines, the game has
interesting properties. We start with two special cases to
provide some intuition about the game. The weight 
matrices are shown in figure 1(a) and (b), which correspond
respectively to the equal-weight and opposite-weight games.
Let x and y denote the respective bids of users 1 and 2 on
machine 1. Denote by s = x + y and δ = (2 − s)/s.
Equal-weight game. In Figure 1, both users have equal
valuations for the two machines. By the optimality 
condition, for the bid vectors to be in equilibrium, they need to
satisfy the following equations according to (1)
α
y
(x + y)2
= (1 − α)
1 − y
(2 − x − y)2
α
x
(x + y)2
= (1 − α)
1 − x
(2 − x − y)2
By simplifying the above equations, we obtain that δ =
1 − 1/α and x = y = α. Thus, there exists a unique Nash
equilibrium of the game where the two users have the same
bidding vector. At the equilibrium, the utility of each user
is 1/2, and the social welfare is 1. On the other hand, the
social optimum is clearly 1. Thus, the equal-weight game
is ideal as the efficiency, utility uniformity, and the 
envyfreeness are all 1.

Opposite-weight game. The situation is different for
the opposite game in which the two users put the exact
opposite weights on the two machines. Assume that α ≥
1/2. Similarly, for the bid vectors to be at the equilibrium,
they need to satisfy
α

(x + y)2
= (1 − α)
1 − y
(2 − x − y)2
(1 − α)

By simplifying the above equations, we have that each
Nash equilibrium corresponds to a nonnegative root of the
cubic equation f(δ) = δ3
− cδ2
+ cδ − 1 = 0, where c =
1
2α(1−α)
− 1.
Clearly, δ = 1 is a root of f(δ). When δ = 1, we have
that x = α, y = 1 − α, which is the symmetric equilibrium
that is consistent with our intuition - each user puts a
bid proportional to his preference of the machine. At this
equilibrium, U = 2 − 4α(1 − α), U∗
= 2α, and U/U∗
=
(2α + 1
α
) − 2, which is minimized when α =
√

with the
minimum value of 2
√
2 − 2 ≈ 0.828. However, when α is
large enough, there exist two other roots, corresponding to
less intuitive asymmetric equilibria.
Intuitively, the asymmetric equilibrium arises when user 1
values machine 1 a lot, but by placing even a relatively small
bid on machine 1, he can get most of the machine because
user 2 values machine 1 very little, and thus places an even
smaller bid. In this case, user 1 gets most of machine 1 and
almost half of machine 2.
The threshold is at when f (1) = 0, i.e. when c = 1
2α(1−α)
=
4. This solves to α0 = 2+
√

≈ 0.854. Those asymmetric
equilibria at δ = 1 are bad as they yield lower efficiency
than the symmetric equilibrium. Let δ0 be the minimum
root. When α → 0, c → +∞, and δ0 = 1/c + o(1/c) → 0.
Then, x, y → 1. Thus, U → 3/2, U∗
→ 2, and U/U∗
→ 0.75.
From the above simple game, we already observe that the
Nash equilibrium may not be unique, which is different from
many congestion games in which the Nash equilibrium is
unique.
For the general two player game, we can show that 0.75
is actually the worst efficiency bound with a proof in [5].
Further, at the asymmetric equilibrium, the utility 
uniformity approaches 1/2 when α → 1. This is the worst possible
for two player games because as we show in Section 3.2, a
user"s utility at any Nash equilibrium is at least 1/m in the
m-player game.
Another consequence is that the two player game is 
always envy-free. Suppose that the two user"s shares are r1 =
(r11, . . . , r1n) and r2 = (r21, . . . , r2n) respectively. Then
U1(r1) + U1(r2) = U1(r1 + r2) = U1(1, . . . , 1) = 1 because
ri1 + ri2 = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Again by that U1(r1) ≥ 1/2,
we have that U1(r1) ≥ U1(r2), i.e. any equilibrium 
allocation is envy-free.
Theorem 2. For a two player game, π(Q) ≥ 3/4, τ(Q) ≥
0.5, and ρ(Q) = 1. All the bounds are tight in the worst case.
3.2 Multi-player Game
For large numbers of players, the loss in social welfare
can be unfortunately large. The following example shows
the worst case bound. Consider a system with m = n2
+ n
players and n machines. Of the players, there are n2
who
have the same weights on all the machines, i.e. 1/n on each
machine. The other n players have weight 1, each on a 
different machine and 0 (or a sufficiently small ) on all the
other machines. Clearly, U∗
= n. The following allocation
is an equilibrium: the first n2
players evenly distribute their
money among all the machines, the other n player invest all
of their money on their respective favorite machine. Hence,
the total money on each machine is n + 1. At this 
equilibrium, each of the first n2
players receives 1
n
1/n
n+1
= 1
n2(n+1)
on
each machine, resulting in a total utility of n3
· 1
n2(n+1)
< 1.
The other n players each receives 1
n+1
on their favorite 
machine, resulting in a total utility of n · 1
n+1
< 1. Therefore,
the total utility of the equilibrium is < 2, while the social
optimum is n = Θ(
√
m). This bound is the worst possible.
What about the utility uniformity of the multi-player 
allocation game? We next show that the utility uniformity of
the m-player allocation game cannot exceed m.
Let (S1, . . . , Sn) be the current total bids on the n 
machines, excluding user i. User i can ensure a utility of 1/m
by distributing his budget proportionally to the current bids.
That is, user i, by bidding sij = Xi/
Pn
i=1 Si on machine j,
obtains a resource level of:
rij =
sij
sij + Sj
=

where

j=1 Xj − Xi = m − 1.
Therefore, rij = 1
1+m−1
= 1

. The total utility of user i
is
nX
j=1
rijwij = (1/m)

j=1
wij = 1/m .
Since each user"s utility cannot exceed 1, the minimal 
possible uniformity is 1/m.
While the utility uniformity can be small, the envy-freeness,
on the other hand, is bounded by a constant of 2
√
2 − 2 ≈
0.828, as shown in [29]. To summarize, we have that

τ(Q) ≥ 1/m, and ρ(Q) ≥ 2

2 − 2. All of these bounds are
tight in the worst case.
