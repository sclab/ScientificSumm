The primary advantage of distributed shared clusters like
the Grid [7] and PlanetLab [1] is their ability to pool 
together shared computational resources. This allows increased
throughput because of statistical multiplexing and the bursty
utilization pattern of typical users. Sharing nodes that are
dispersed in the network allows lower delay because 
applications can store data close to users. Finally, sharing allows
greater reliability because of redundancy in hosts and 
network connections.
However, resource allocation in these systems remains the
major challenge. The problem is how to allocate a shared
resource both fairly and efficiently (where efficiency is the
ratio of the achieved social welfare to the social optimal)
with the presence of strategic users who act in their own
interests.
Several non-economic allocation algorithms have been 
proposed, but these typically assume that task values (i.e., their
importance) are the same, or are inversely proportional to
the resources required, or are set by an omniscient 
administrator. However, in many cases, task values vary 
significantly, are not correlated to resource requirements, and are
difficult and time-consuming for an administrator to set. 
Instead, we examine a market-based resource allocation 
system (others are described in [2, 4, 6, 21, 26, 27]) that allows
users to express their preferences for resources through a
bidding mechanism.
In particular, we consider a price-anticipating [12] scheme
in which a user bids for a resource and receives the ratio of
his bid to the sum of bids for that resource. This 
proportional scheme is simpler, more scalable, and more 
responsive [15] than auction-based schemes [6, 21, 26]. Previous
work has analyzed price-anticipating schemes in the context
of allocating network capacity for flows for users with 
unlimited budgets. In this work, we examine a price-anticipating
scheme in the context of allocating computational 
capacity for users with private preferences and limited budgets,
resulting in a qualitatively different game (as discussed in
Section 6).
In this paper, we formulate the fixed budget resource 
allocation game and study the existence and performance of
the Nash equilibria of this game. For evaluating the Nash
equilibria, we consider both their efficiency, measuring how
close the social welfare at equilibrium is to the social 
optimum, and fairness, measuring how different the users" 
utilities are. Although rarely considered in previous game 
theoretical study, we believe fairness is a critical metric for a
resource allocation schemes because the perception of 
unfairness will cause some users to reject a system with more
efficient, but less fair resource allocation in favor of one with
less efficient, more fair resource allocation. We use both 
utility uniformity and envy-freeness to measure fairness. 
Utility uniformity, which is common in Computer Science work,
measures the closeness of utilities of different users. 
Envyfreeness, which is more from the Economic perspective, 
measures the happiness of users with their own resources 
compared to the resources of others.
Our contributions are as follows:
• We analyze the existence and performance of
127
Nash equilibria. Using analysis, we show that there is
always a Nash equilibrium in the fixed budget game if the
utility functions satisfy a fairly weak and natural condition
of strong competitiveness. We also show the worst case 
performance bounds: for m players the efficiency at equilibrium
is Ω(1/
√
m), the utility uniformity is ≥ 1/m, and the 
envyfreeness ≥ 2
√
2−2 ≈ 0.83. Although these bounds are quite
low, the simulations described below indicate these bounds
are overly pessimistic.
• We describe algorithms that allow strategic users
to optimize their utility. As part of the fixed budget
game analysis, we show that strategic users with linear 
utility functions can calculate their bids using a best response
algorithm that quickly results in an allocation with high 
efficiency with little computational and communication 
overhead. We present variations of the best response algorithm
for both finite and infinite parallelism tasks. In addition, we
present a local greedy adjustment algorithm that converges
more slowly than best response, but allows for non-linear or
unformulatable utility functions.
• We show that the price-anticipating resource 
allocation mechanism achieves a high degree of 
efficiency and fairness. Using simulation, we find that 
although the socially optimal allocation results in perfect 
efficiency, it also results in very poor fairness. Likewise, 
allocating according to only users" preference weights results in a
high fairness, but a mediocre efficiency. Intuition would 
suggest that efficiency and fairness are exclusive. Surprisingly,
the Nash equilibrium, reached by each user iteratively 
applying the best response algorithm to adapt his bids, achieves
nearly the efficiency of the social optimum and nearly the
fairness of the weight-proportional allocation: the efficiency
is ≥ 0.90, the utility uniformity is ≥ 0.65, and the 
envyfreeness is ≥ 0.97, independent of the number of users in
the system. In addition, the time to converge to the 
equilibrium is ≤ 5 iterations when all users use the best response
strategy. The local adjustment algorithm performs similarly
when there is sufficient competitiveness, but takes 25 to 90
iterations to stabilize.
As a result, we believe that shared distributed systems
based on the fixed budget game can be highly decentralized,
yet achieve a high degree of efficiency and fairness.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We 
describe the model in Section 2 and derive the performance
at the Nash equilibria for the infinite parallelism model in
Section 3. In Section 4, we describe algorithms for users
to optimize their own utility in the fixed budget game. In
Section 5, we describe our simulator and simulation results.
We describe related work in Section 6. We conclude by 
discussing some limit of our model and future work in Section 7.
