There are two main groups of related work in resource
allocation: those that incorporate an economic mechanism,
and those that do not.
One non-economic approach is scheduling (surveyed by
Pinedo [20]). Examples of this approach are queuing in
first-come, first-served (FCFS) order, queueing using the 
resource consumption of tasks (e.g., [28]), and scheduling 
using combinatorial optimization [19]. These all assume that
the values and resource consumption of tasks are reported
accurately, which does not apply in the presence of strategic
users. We view scheduling and resource allocation as two
separate functions. Resource allocation divides a resource
among different users while scheduling takes a given 
allocation and orders a user"s jobs.
Examples of the economic approach are Spawn [26]), work
by Stoica, et al. [24]., the Millennium resource allocator [4],
work by Wellman, et al. [27], Bellagio [2]), and Tycoon [15]).
Spawn and the work by Wellman, et al. uses a reservation
abstraction similar to the way airline seats are allocated.
Unfortunately, reservations have a high latency to acquire
resources, unlike the price-anticipating scheme we consider.
The tradeoff of the price-anticipating schemes is that users
have uncertainty about exactly how much of the resources
they will receive.
Bellagio[3] uses the SHARE centralized allocator. SHARE
allocates resources using a centralized combinatorial auction
that allows users to express preferences with 
complementarities. Solving the NP-complete combinatorial auction 
problem provides an optimally efficient allocation. The 
priceanticipating scheme that we consider does not explicitly 
operate on complementarities, thereby possibly losing some 
efficiency, but it also avoids the complexity and overhead of
combinatorial auctions.
There have been several analyses [10, 11, 12, 13, 23] of
variations of price-anticipating allocation schemes in the 
context of allocation of network capacity for flows. Their 
methodology follows the study of congestion (potential) games [17,
22] by relating the Nash equilibrium to the solution of a
(usually convex) global optimization problem. But those
techniques no longer apply to our game because we model
users as having fixed budgets and private preferences for
machines. For example, unlike those games, there may 
exist multiple Nash equilibria in our game. Milchtaich [16]
studied congestion games with private preferences but the
technique in [16] is specific to the congestion game.
