Recommender systems have become integral to e-commerce,
providing technology that suggests products to a visitor
based on previous purchases or rating history. 
Collaborative filtering, a common form of recommendation, predicts
a user"s rating for an item by combining (other) ratings of
that user with other users" ratings. Significant research has
been conducted in implementing fast and accurate 
collaborative filtering algorithms [2, 7], designing interfaces for
presenting recommendations to users [1], and studying the
robustness of these algorithms [8]. However, with the 
exception of a few studies on the influence of users [10], little
attention has been paid to unraveling the inner workings
of a recommender in terms of the individual ratings and the
roles they play in making (good) recommendations. Such an
understanding will give an important handle to monitoring
and managing a recommender system, to engineer 
mechanisms to sustain the recommender, and thereby ensure its
continued success.
Our motivation here is to disaggregate global recommender
performance metrics into contributions made by each 
individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles
played by ratings in nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering.
We identify three possible roles: (scouts) to connect the user
into the system to receive recommendations, (promoters) to
connect an item into the system to be recommended, and
(connectors) to connect ratings of these two kinds. Viewing
ratings in this way, we can define the contribution of a 
rating in each role, both in terms of allowing recommendations
to occur, and in terms of influence on the quality of 
recommendations. In turn, this capability helps support scenarios
such as:
1. Situating users in better neighborhoods: A user"s 
ratings may inadvertently connect the user to a 
neighborhood for which the user"s tastes may not be a perfect
match. Identifying ratings responsible for such bad
recommendations and suggesting new items to rate can
help situate the user in a better neighborhood.
2. Targeting items: Recommender systems suffer from
lack of user participation, especially in cold-start 
scenarios [13] involving newly arrived items. Identifying
users who can be encouraged to rate specific items
helps ensure coverage of the recommender system.
3. Monitoring the evolution of the recommender system
and its stakeholders: A recommender system is 
constantly under change: growing with new users and
250
items, shrinking with users leaving the system, items
becoming irrelevant, and parts of the system under 
attack. Tracking the roles of a rating and its evolution
over time provides many insights into the health of the
system, and how it could be managed and improved.
These include being able to identify rating subspaces
that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to
system performance, and could be removed; to 
enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, or have left
the system; and to assess the susceptibility of the 
system to attacks such as shilling [5].
As we show, the characterization of rating roles presented
here provides broad primitives to manage a recommender
system and its community. The rest of the paper is 
organized as follows. Background on nearest-neighbor 
collaborative filtering and algorithm evaluation is discussed in 
Section 2. Section 3 defines and discusses the roles of a rating,
and Section 4 defines measures of the contribution of a 
rating in each of these roles. In Section 5, we illustrate the use
of these roles to address the goals outlined above.
