Several authors have addressed the problem of the management
of content in distributed networks. Much of the work focuses on
the policy management aspect. For example in [5], the problem
of serving multimedia content via distributed servers is 
considered. Content is distributed among server resources in proportion
to user demand using a Demand Dissemination Protocol. The 
performance of the scheme is benchmarked via simulation. In [1]
content is distributed among sub-caches. The authors construct a
system employing various components, such as a Central Router,
Cache Knowledge base, Subcaches, and a Subcache eviction judge.
The Cache Knowledge base allows sophisticated policies to be 
employed. Simulation is used to compare the proposed scheme with
well-known replacement algorithms. Our work differs in that we
are considering more than the policy management aspects of the
problem. After carefully considering the required functionality to
implement content management in the networked environment, we
have partitioned the system into three simple functions, namely
Content manager, Policy manager and Storage manager. This has
allowed us to easily implement and experiment with a prototype
system.
Other related work involves so called TV recommendation 
systems which are used in PVRs to automatically select content for
users, e.g. [6]. In the case where Spectrum is used in a PVR 
configuration this type of system would perform a higher level function
and could clearly benefit from the functionalities of the Spectrum
architecture.
Finally, in the commercial CDN environment vendors (e.g. Cisco
and Netapp) have developed and implemented content management
products and tools. Unlike the Spectrum architecture which allows
edge devices to operate in a largely autonomous fashion, the 
vendor solutions typically are more tightly coupled to a centralized
controller and do not have the sophisticated time-based operations
offered by Spectrum.
