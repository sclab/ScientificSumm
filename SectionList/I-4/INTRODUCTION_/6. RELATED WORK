Fatima, Wooldridge and Jennings [1] studied the multiple issues
in negotiation in terms of the agenda and negotiation procedure.
However, this work is limited since it only involves a single agent"s
perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part
of a negotiation chain. Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an 
approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the 
negotiation chain scenario occurs. It models the negotiation problem as
a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) and a 
cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions
of the DCOP. In our work, the negotiation involves more 
complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a
distribution approach where no centralized control is needed. A
mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the
coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is
different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative
system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all.
A combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to 
solving the negotiation chain problem. However, in a combinatorial
auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of 
negotiations. This would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed
when the same-deadline policy is used.
