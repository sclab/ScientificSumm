In this paper, we have solved negotiation chain problems by 
extending our multi-linked negotiation model from the perspective of
a single agent to multiple agents. Instead of solving the negotiation
chain problem in a centralized approach, we adopt a distributed 
approach where each agent has an extended local model and 
decisionmaking process. We have introduced a pre-negotiation phase that
allows agents to transfer meta-level information on related 
negotiation issues. Using this information, the agent can build a more
accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the 
relationship of flexibility and success probability. This more accurate
model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation 
solution. The experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve
the agent"s and the system"s overall performance significantly. In
future extension of this work, we would like to develop 
mechanisms to verify how reliable the agents are. We also recognize
that the current approach of applying the meta-level information
is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning 
mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to
adjust its local model from previous experience. To further verify
this distributed approach, we would like to develop a centralized
approach, so we can evaluate how good the solution from this 
distributed approach is compared to the optimal solution found by the
centralized approach.
