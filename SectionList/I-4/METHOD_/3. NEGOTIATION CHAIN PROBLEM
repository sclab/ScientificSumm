Negotiation chain problem occurs in a multi-agent system, where
each agent represents an individual, a company, or an organization,
and there is no absolute authority in the system. Each agent has
its own utility function for defining the implications of achieving
its goals. The agent is designed to optimize its expected utility
given its limited information, computational and communication
resources. Dynamic tasks arrive to individual agents, most tasks
requiring the coordination of multiple agents. Each agent has the
scheduling and planning ability to manage its local activities, some
of these activities are related to other agents" activities. Negotiation
is used to coordinate the scheduling of these mutual related 
activities. The negotiation is tightly connected with the agent"s local
scheduling/planning processes and is also related to other 
negotiations. An agent may be involved in multiple related negotiations
with multiple other agents, and each of the other agents may be
involved in related negotiations with others too.
Figure 1 describes a complex negotiation chain scenario. The
Store, the PC manufacturer, the Memory Producer and the 
Distribution Center are all involved in multi-linked negotiation 
problems. Figure 2 shows a distributed model of part of the negotiation
chain described in Figure 1. Each agent has a local optimization
problem - the multi-linked negotiation problem (represented as an
and-or tree), which can be solved using the model and procedures
described in Section 2. However, the local optimal solution may
not be optimal in the global context given the local model is neither
complete or accurate. The dash line in Figure 2 represents the 
connection of these local optimization problem though the common
negotiation subject.
Negotiation chain problem O is a group of tightly-coupled local
optimization problems:
O = {O1, O2, ....On}, Oi denotes the local optimization problem
(multi-linked negotiation problem) of agent Ai
Agent Ai"s local optimal solution Slo
i maximizes the expected 
local utility based on an incomplete information and assumptions
about other agents" local strategies - we defined such incomplete
information and imperfect assumptions of agent i as Ii):
Uexp
i (Slo
i , Ii) ≥ Uexp
i (Sx
i , Ii) for all x = lo.
However, the combination of these local optimal solutions {Slo
i } :
< Slo
1 , Slo
2 , ....Slo
n > can be sub-optimal to a set of better local
optimal solutions {Sblo
i } : < Sblo
1 , Sblo
2 , ....Sblo
n > if the global
utility can be improved without any agent"s local utility being 
decreased by using {Sblo
i }. In other words, {Slo
i } is dominated by
{Sblo
i } ({Slo
i } ≺ {Sblo
i }) iff:
Ui(< Slo
1 , Slo
2 , ....Slo
n >) ≤ Ui(< Sblo
1 , Sblo
2 , ....Sblo
n >) for
i = 1, ...n and
Pn
i=1 Ui(< Slo
1 , Slo
2 , ....Slo
n >) <
Pn
i=1 Ui(< Sblo
1 , Sblo
2 , ....Sblo
n >)
There are multiple sets of better local optimal solutions: {Sblo1
i },
{Sblo2
i }, ... {Sblom
i }. Some of them may be dominated by others.
A set of better local optimal solutions {S

i } that is not 
dominated by any others is called best local optimal. If a set of best
local optimal solutions {S
blog
i } dominates all others, {S
blog
i } is
called globally local optimal. However, sometimes the globally
local optimal set does not exist, instead, there exist multiple sets
of best local optimal solutions. Even if the globally local optimal
solution does exist in theory, finding it may not be realistic given
the agents are making decision concurrently, to construct the 
perfect local information and assumptions about other agents (Ii) in
this dynamic environment is a very difficult and sometimes even
impossible task.
The goal of this work is to improve each agent"s local model
about other agents (Ii) through meta-level coordination. As Ii 
become more accurate, the agent"s local optimal solution to its local
multi-linked negotiation problem become a better local optimal 
solution in the context of the global negotiation chain problem. We
are not arguing that this statement is a universal valid statement
that holds in all situations, but our experimental work shows that
the sum of the agents" utilities in the system has been improved by
95% on average when meta-level coordination is used to improve
each agent"s local model Ii. In this work, we focus on improving
the agent"s local model through two directions. One direction is
to build a better function to describe the relationship between the
success probability of the negotiation and the flexibility allocated
to the negotiation. The other direction is to find how to allocate
time more efficiently for each negotiation in the negotiation chain
context.
