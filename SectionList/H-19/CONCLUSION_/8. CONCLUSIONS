This paper took a whole new perspective of analyzing
feature trajectories as time domain signals. By 
considering the word document frequencies in both time and 
frequency domains, we were able to derive many new 
characteristics about news streams that were previously unknown,
e.g., the different distributions of stopwords during 
weekdays and weekends. For the first time in the area of TDT,
we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect
important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic events.
The key idea of our work lies in the observations that
(a)periodic events have (a)periodic representative features
and (un)important events have (in)active representative 
features, differentiated by their power spectrums and time 
periods. To address the real event detection problem, a simple
and effective mixture density-based approach was used to
identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods.
We also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to 
detect both aperiodic and periodic events, which was successful
in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real
news stream.
Although we have not made any benchmark comparison
against another approach, simply because there is no 
previous work in the addressed problem. Future work includes
evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news
stream, and comparing our model against the closest 
equivalent methods, which currently are limited to the methods of
Kleinberg [12] (which can only detect certain type of bursty
events depending on parameter settings), Fung et al. [9], and
Swan and Allan [18]. Nevertheless, we believe our simple
and effective method will be useful for all TDT 
practitioners, and will be especially useful for the initial exploratory
analysis of news streams.
