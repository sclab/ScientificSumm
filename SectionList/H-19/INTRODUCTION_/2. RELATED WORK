This work is largely motivated by a broader family of
problems collectively known as Topic Detection and 
Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10]. Moreover, most TDT
research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying
documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6]
for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the
word trajectory with respect to time. Swan and Allan [18]
first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.
However, they only considered named entities and noun
phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities. On the
contrary, our paper considers all of the above.
Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling
an event in text streams as a burst of activities by 
incorporating temporal information. Kleinberg"s seminal work
described how bursty features can be extracted from text
streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which 
inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumar"s 
identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Mei"s
summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15],
He"s clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.
Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified
features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered
busty features to identify various bursty events. Our work
differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every 
single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features
along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power),
yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not
restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.
Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by
Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from
query logs. Their focus was on detecting multiple 
periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used
to index words for query-by-burst search. In this paper,
we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two
dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with
the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic
bursty events.
