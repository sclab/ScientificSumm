In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our 
approach by simulated experiments. Context providers A and
B negotiate to reach agreement. They get QoC requirements
and calculate the distance between Qoc requirements and
their QoC. For simplicity, in our experiments, we assume
that the distance has been calculated, and dA represents
distance between QoC requirements and A"s QoC, dB 
represents distance between QoC requirements and B"s QoC.
The domain of dA and dB is [0,500]. We assume 
reputation value is a real number and its domain is [-1000, 1000],
repA represents A"s reputation value and repB represents
B"s reputation value. We assume that both providers pay
the most attention to the system"s interests, and pay the
least attention to the reward, thus w1 > w2 > w3, and the
weight of Ud approximates the weight of Urep. A and B"s
utility functions and weights of c, p and ep are defined in
Table 1. We set deadline tdeadline = 100, and define time
discount function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t) of A
and B as follows:
δA(t) = 0.9t
δB(t) = 0.88t
cA(t) = (
t
tdeadline
)

cB(t) = (

Given different values of dA, dB, repA and repB, A and
B negotiate to reach agreement. The provider that starts
the negotiation is chosen at random. We hope that when
dA dB and repA repB, A will get the right to 
provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds, and
when ∆d = dA − dB is in a small range (e.g. [-50,50]) and
∆rep = repA − repB is in a small range (e.g. [-50,50]), A
and B will get approximately equal opportunities to provide
context, and allocate the proceeds evenly. When dA−dB
500

approximates to dA−dB
1000
(i.e. the two providers" abilities to
provide context information are approximately equal), we
also hope that A and B get equal opportunities to provide
context and allocate the proceeds evenly.
According to the three situations above, we make three
experiments as follows:
Experiment 1 : In this experiment, A and B negotiate
with each other for 50 times, and at each time, we assign 
different values to dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying dA dB and
repA repB) and the reserved utilities of A and B. When
the experiment is completed, we find 3 negotiation games
are terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved
utility. A gets the right to provide context for 47 times.
The average portion of proceeds A get is about 0.683, and
B"s average portion of proceeds is 0.317. The average time
cost to reach agreement is 8.4. We also find that when B
asks A to provide context in its first offer, B can require and
get more portion of the proceeds because of its goodwill.
Experiment 2 : A and B also negotiate with each other
for 50 times in this experiment given different values of dA,
dB, repA, repB (satisfying −50 ≤ ∆d = dA − dB ≤ 50 and
−50 ≤ ∆rep = drep −drep ≤ 50) and the reserved utilities of
A and B. After the experiment, we find that there are 8 
negotiation games terminated due to the utility lower than the
reserved utility. A and B get the right to provide context
for 20 times and 22 times respectively. The average portion
of proceeds A get is 0.528 and B"s average portion of the
proceeds is 0.472. The average time cost on negotiation is
10.5.
Experiment 3 : In this experiment, A and B also 
negotiate with each other for 50 times given dA, dB, repA, repB
(satisfying −0.2 ≤ dA−dB
500
− dA−dB
1000
≤ 0.2) and the reserved
utilities of A and B. There are 6 negotiation games 
terminated forcibly. A and B get the right to provide context
for 21 times and 23 times respectively. The average portion
of proceeds A get is 0.481 and B"s average portion of the
proceeds is 0.519. The average time cost on negotiation is
9.2.
One thing should be mentioned is that except for d, rep,
p and ep, other factors (e.g. weights, time discount 
function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t)) could also affect
the negotiation outcome. These factors should be adjusted
according to providers" beliefs at the beginning of each 
negotiation process. In our experiments, for similarity, we assign
values to them without any particularity in advance. These
experiments" results prove that our approach can choose an
appropriate context provider and can provide a relatively
fair proceeds allocation. When one provider is obviously
more appropriate than the other provider, the provider will
get the right to provide context and get a major portion of
the proceeds. When both providers have the approximately
same abilities to provide context, their opportunities to 
provide context are equal and they can get about a half portion
of the proceeds respectively.
