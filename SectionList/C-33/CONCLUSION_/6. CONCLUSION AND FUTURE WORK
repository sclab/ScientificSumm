How to provide the appropriate context information is a
challenging problem in pervasive computing. In this paper,
we have presented a novel approach based on negotiation
with rewards to attempt to solve such problem. Distributed
context providers negotiate with each other to reach 
agreement on the issues who can provide the appropriate 
context and how they allocate the proceeds. The results of
our experiments have showed that our approach can choose
an appropriate context provider, and also can guarantee
providers" interests by a relatively fair proceeds allocation.
In this paper, we only consider how to choose an 
appropriate context provider from two providers. In the future
work, this negotiation model will be extended, and more
than two context providers can negotiate with each other to
decide who is the most appropriate context provider. In the
extended negotiation model, how to design efficient 
negotiation strategies will be a challenging problem. We assume
that the context provider will fulfill its promise of reward in
the next negotiation process. In fact, the context provider
might deceive its opponent and provide illusive promise. We
should solve this problem in the future. We also should deal
with interactions which are interrupted by failing 
communication links in the future work.
