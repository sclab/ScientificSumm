Before introducing our approach, we would like to give
some assumptions:
1. All context providers are well-meaning and honest.
During the negotiation process, they exchange 
information honestly. Rewards confirmed in this 
negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation
process.
2. All providers must guarantee the system"s interests.
They should provide appropriate context information
for current applications. After guaranteeing the 
system"s interest, they can try to maximize their own 
personal interests. The assumption is reasonable, because
when an inappropriate context provider gets the right
to provide bad context, as a punishment, its 
reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small.
3. As context providers are independent, factors which
influence their negotiation stance and behavior are 
private and not available to their opponents. Their utility
functions are also private.
4. Since the negotiation takes place in pervasive 
environments, time is a critical factors. The current 
application often hopes to get context information as quickly
as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should
be as short as possible. Context providers often have
strict deadline by when the negotiation must be 
completed.
After presenting these assumptions, we will propose our 
approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next 
section.
