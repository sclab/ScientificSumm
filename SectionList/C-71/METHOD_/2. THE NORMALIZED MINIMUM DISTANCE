ι: A POINT-DISTRIBUTION INDEX
Suppose there are n points in a Euclidean space Ω. The 
coordinates of these points are denoted by xi (i = 1, ..., n).
It may be necessary to evaluate how the distribution of these
points is. There are many metrics to achieve this goal. For 
example, the Mean Square Error from these points to their mean value
can be employed to calculate how these points deviate from their
mean (i.e., their central). In resource-sharing evaluation, the Global
Fairness Index (GFI) is often employed to measure how even the
resource distributes among these points [8], when xi represents the
amount of resource that belong to point i. In WSNs, GFI is usually
used to calculate how even the remaining energy of sensor nodes
is.
When n is larger than 2 and the points do not all overlap (That
points all overlap means xi = xj, ∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n). We propose
a novel index called the normalized minimum distance, namely ι,
to evaluate the distribution of the points. ι is the minimum distance
between each pair of points normalized by the average distance
between each pair of points. It is calculated by:
ι =
min(||xi − xj||)
µ
(∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n; and i = j) (1)
where ||xi − xj|| denotes the Euclidean distance between point
i and point j in Ω, the min(·) function calculates the minimum
distance between each pair of points, and µ is the average distance
between each pair of points, which is:
µ =
(

i=1
Pn
j=1,j=i ||xi − xj||)
n(n − 1)

ι measures how well the points separate from one another. 
Obviously, ι is in interval [0, 1]. ι is equal to 1 if and only if n is equal
to 3 and these three points forms an equilateral triangle. ι is equal
to zero if any two points overlap. ι is a very interesting value of a
set of points. If we consider each xi (∀i = 1, ..., n) is a variable in
Ω, how these n points would look like if ι is maximized?
An algorithm is implemented to generate the topology in which
ι is locally maximized (The algorithm can be found in [19]). We
consider a 2-dimensional space. We select n = 10, 20, 30, ..., 100
and perform this algorithm. In order to avoid that the algorithm
converge to local optimum, we select different random seeds to
generate the initial points for 1000 time and obtain the best one
that results in the largest ι when the algorithm converges. Figure 1
demonstrates what the resulting topology looks like when n = 20
as an example.
Suppose each point represents a sensor node. If the sensor 
coverage model is the Boolean coverage model [15][17][18][14] and
the coverage radius of each node is the same. It is exciting to see
that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi
diagram [2] formed by these nodes (A Vonoroi diagram formed by
a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such
that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node)
is a honeycomb-like structure1
.
This enlightens us that ι may be employed to solve problems
related to sensor-coverage of an area. In WSNs, it is desirable

deployed and why such a network is called a cellular one.

that the active sensor nodes that are performing surveillance task
should separate from one another. Under the constraint that the
sensing area should be covered, the more each node separates from
the others, the less the redundancy of the coverage is. ι indicates
the quality of such separation. It should be useful for approaches
on sensor-coverage related problems.
In our following discussions, we will show the effectiveness of
employing ι in sensor-grouping problem.
