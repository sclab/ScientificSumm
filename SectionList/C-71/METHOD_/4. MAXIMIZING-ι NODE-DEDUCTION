ALGORITHM FOR SENSOR-GROUPING
PROBLEM
Before we process to introduce algorithms to solve the sensor
grouping problem, let us define the margin (denoted by θ) of an
area φ monitored by the network as the band-like marginal area
of φ and all the points on the outer perimeter of θ is ρ distance
away from all the points on the inner perimeter of θ. ρ is called the
margin length.
In a practical network, sensor nodes are usually evenly deployed
in the network area. Obviously, the number of sensor nodes that
can sense an event occurring in the margin of the network is smaller
than the number of sensor nodes that can sense an event occurring
in other area of the network. Based on this consideration, in our
algorithm design, we ensure the coverage quality of the network
area except the margin. The information on φ and ρ is 
networkbased. Each in-network sensor node can be pre-programmed or
on-line informed about φ and ρ, and thus calculate whether a point
in its sensing area is in the margin or not.
4.1 Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction Algorithm
The node-deduction process of our Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction
Algorithm (MIND) is simple. A node i greedily maximizes ι of the
sub-network composed by itself, its ungrouped sensing neighbors,
and the neighbors that are in the same group of itself. Under the
constraint that the coverage quality of its sensing area should be
ensured, node i deletes nodes in this sub-network one by one. The
candidate to be pruned satisfies that:
• It is an ungrouped node.
• The deletion of the node will not result in uncovered-points
inside the sensing area of i.
A candidate is deleted if the deletion of the candidate results in
largest ι of the sub-network compared to the deletion of other 
candidates. This node-deduction process continues until no candidate
can be found. Then all the ungrouped sensing neighbors that are
not deleted are grouped into the same group of node i. We call the
sensing neighbors that are in the same group of node i the group
sensing neighbors of node i. We then call node i a finished node,
meaning that it has finished the above procedure and the sensing
area of the node is covered. Those nodes that have not yet finished
this procedure are called unfinished nodes.
The above procedure initiates at a random-selected node that is
not in the margin. The node is grouped to the first group. It 
calculates the resulting group sensing neighbors of it based on the above
procedure. It informs these group sensing neighbors that they are
selected in the group. Then it hands over the above procedure to
an unfinished group sensing neighbors that is the farthest from 
itself. This group sensing neighbor continues this procedure until no
unfinished neighbor can be found. Then the first group is formed
(Algorithmic description of this procedure can be found at [19]).
After a group is formed, another random-selected ungrouped
node begins to group itself to the second group and initiates the
above procedure. In this way, groups are formed one by one. When
a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage
quality if its sensing area, except what overlaps the network margin,
cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are
grouped into the same group as itself, the algorithm stops. MIND
is based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes. It is
a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution of
Problem 1.
4.2 Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm:
A Benchmark for MIND
To evaluate the effectiveness of introducing ι in the sensor-group
problem, another algorithm for sensor-group problem called 
Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) is designed. Our aim
1174
is to evaluate how an idea, i.e., MIND, based on locally maximize
ι performs.
In ICQA, a node-selecting process is as follows. A node i 
greedily selects an ungrouped sensing neighbor in the same group as 
itself one by one, and informs the neighbor it is selected in the group.
The criterion is:
• The selected neighbor is responsible to provide surveillance
work for some uncovered parts of node i"s sensing area. (i.e.,
the coverage quality requirement of the parts is not fulfilled
if this neighbor is not selected.)
• The selected neighbor results in highest improvement of the
coverage quality of the neighbor"s sensing area.
The improvement of the coverage quality, mathematically, should
be the integral of the the improvements of all points inside the
neighbor"s sensing area. A numerical approximation is employed
to calculate this improvement. Details are presented in our 
simulation study.
This node-selecting process continues until the sensing area of
node i is entirely covered. In this way, node i"s group sensing
neighbors are found. The above procedure is handed over as what
MIND does and new groups are thus formed one by one. And
the condition that ICQA stops is the same as MIND. ICQA is also
based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes. ICQA is
also a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution
of Problem 1.
