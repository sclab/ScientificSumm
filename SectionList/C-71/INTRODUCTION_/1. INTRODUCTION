A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of
in-situ battery-powered sensor nodes. A WSN can collect the data
about physical phenomena of interest [1]. There are many 
potential applications of WSNs, including environmental monitoring and
surveillance, etc. [1][11].
In many application scenarios, WSNs are employed to conduct
surveillance tasks in adverse, or even worse, in hostile working 
environments. One major problem caused is that sensor nodes are
subjected to failures. Therefore, fault tolerance of a WSN is 
critical.
One way to achieve fault tolerance is that a WSN should contain
a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node 
failures. It is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be
working in sleeping mode (i.e., major power-consuming units such
as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be shut off) to
save energy, and thus to prolong the network lifetime. Redundancy
should be exploited as much as possible for the set of sensors that
are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network
area [6].
We find that the minimum distance between each pair of points
normalized by the average distance between each pair of points
serves as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points. We
call this index, denoted by ι, the normalized minimum distance. If
points are moveable, we find that maximizing ι results in a 
honeycomb structure. The honeycomb structure poses that the coverage
efficiency is the best if each point represents a sensor node that
is providing surveillance work. Employing ι in coverage-related
problems is thus deemed promising.
This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to 
select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the 
surveillance work of the network area. To explore the effectiveness of
employing ι in coverage-related problems, we formulate a 
sensorgrouping problem for high-redundancy WSNs. An algorithm called
Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which 
redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of
sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of
the network area. We also introduce another greedy solution called
Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) for this problem,
which serves as a benchmark to evaluate MIND.
The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we 
introduce a novel index ι for evaluation of point-distribution. We show
that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the 
network. Second, we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem
for WSNs and provide a general sensing model. With the MIND
algorithm we show that locally maximizing ι among each sensor
node and its neighbors is a good approach to solve this problem.
This demonstrates a good application of employing ι in 
coveragerelated problems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce our point-distribution index ι. We survey related work
and formulate a sensor-grouping problem together with a general
sensing model in Section 3. Section 4 investigates the application
of ι in this grouping problem. We propose MIND for this problem
1171
and introduce ICQA as a benchmark. In Section 5, we present
our simulation results in which MIND and ICQA are compared.
Section 6 provides conclusion remarks.
