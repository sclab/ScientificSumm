We propose ι, a novel index for evaluation of point-distribution.
ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points 
normalized by the average distance between each pair of points. We find
that a set of points that achieve a maximum value of ι result in
a honeycomb structure. We propose that ι can serve as a good
index to evaluate the distribution of the points, which can be 
employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks
(WSNs). To validate this idea, we formulate a general 
sensorgrouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.
We show that locally maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good 
approach to solve this problem with an algorithm called 
Maximizingι Node-Deduction (MIND). Simulation results verify that MIND
outperforms a greedy algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we
design. This demonstrates a good application of employing ι in
coverage-related problems for WSNs.
