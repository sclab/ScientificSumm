Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice,
sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they
require little communication and can be completed almost
instantly. Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner
is immediately determined. However, sealed-bid auctions
do require that the bids be kept private until the auction
clears. The increasing popularity of online auctions only
makes this disadvantage more troublesome. At an auction
house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine
a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.
However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little
more than a server with questionable security; and, since all
participants are in different locations, one can anonymously
attempt to break into the server. In this paper, we present a
game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when
they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on
knowledge of the bids.
We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions:
whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and
which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid
auction is used. Note that two of these cases are trivial.
In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit
a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would
either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the
winning bidder. In a second-price auction, knowing the 
competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant
strategy to bid truthfully. This leaves us with two cases that
we examine in detail.
A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by
looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting
an extra bid. This possibility was pointed out as early as
the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.
For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a
proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction),
then the seller may be able to break into eBay"s server, 
observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and
then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below
it using a false identity. We assume that there is no chance
that the seller will be caught when it cheats. However, not
all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can
successfully cheat). We assume that each bidder knows the
probability with which the seller will cheat. Possible 
motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published exposÂ´e
on seller cheating in eBay auctions. In this setting, we derive
an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each
bidder"s value for the good is independently drawn from a
common distribution (with no further assumptions except
for continuity and differentiability). This result shows how
first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the 
endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.
But why should the seller have all the fun? In a first-price
auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also
called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he
76
wins. To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off
the probability of winning the auction against how much he
will pay if he does win. Of course, if he could simply examine
the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem
is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.
In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding
strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the 
possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders. When
bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed 
uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that
the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on
the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder. This result
is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium
of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.
We conclude this section by exploring other distributions,
including some in which the presence of cheating bidders
actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the
case of a seller cheating in a second price auction. Section
3 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction.
In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of
cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings. We
discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in
auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6. All
proofs and derivations are found in the appendix.
