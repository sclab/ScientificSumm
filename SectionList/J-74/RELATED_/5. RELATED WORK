Existing work covers another dimension along which we
could analyze cheating: altering the perceived value of N.
In this paper, we have assumed that N is known by all
of the bidders. However, in an online setting this 
assumption is rather tenuous. For example, a bidder"s only source
of information about N could be a counter that the seller
places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller
about the number of potential bidders who have indicated
that they will participate. In these cases, the seller could
arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price 
auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the
perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer
to their true valuation. However, if agents are aware that
the seller has this power, then any communication about
N to the agents is cheap talk, and furthermore is not
credible. Thus, in equilibrium the agents would ignore the
declared value of N, and bid according to their own prior
beliefs about the number of agents. If we make the natural
assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to
the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium 
bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of
bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed
to any of the bidders. Of course, instead of assuming that
the seller can always exploit this power, we could assume
that it can only do so with some probability that is known
by the agents. The analysis would then proceed in a similar
manner as that of our cheating seller model.
The other interesting case of this form of cheating is by
bidders in a first-price auction. Bidders would obviously
want to decrease the perceived number of agents in order
to induce their competition to lower their bids. While it is

unreasonable for bidders to be able to alter the perceived
N arbitrarily, collusion provides an opportunity to decrease
the perceived N by having only one of a group of colluding
agents participate in the auction. While the non-colluding
agents would account for this possibility, as long as they are
not certain of the collusion they will still be induced to shave
more off of their bids than they would if the collusion did
not take place. This issue is tackled in [7].
Other types of collusion are of course related to the 
general topic of cheating in auctions. Results on collusion in
first and second-price auctions can be found in [8] and [3],
respectively.
The work most closely related to our first setting is [11],
which also presents a model in which the seller may cheat in
a second-price auction. In their setting, the seller is a 
participant in the Bayesian game who decides between running
a first-price auction (where profitable cheating is never 
possible) or second-price auction. The seller makes this choice
after observing his type, which is his probability of having
the opportunity and willingness to cheat in a second-price
auction. The bidders, who know the distribution from which
the seller"s type is drawn, then place their bid. It is shown
that, in equilibrium, only a seller with the maximum 
probability of cheating would ever choose to run a second-price
auction. Our work differs in that we focus on the agents"
strategies in a second-price auction for a given probability
of cheating by the seller. An explicit derivation of the 
equilibrium strategies then allows us relate first and second-price
auctions.
An area of related work that can be seen as 
complementary to ours is that of secure auctions, which takes the point
of view of an auction designer. The goals often extend
well beyond simply preventing cheating, including 
properties such as anonymity of the bidders and nonrepudiation of
bids. Cryptographic methods are the standard weapon of
choice here (see [1, 4, 9]).
