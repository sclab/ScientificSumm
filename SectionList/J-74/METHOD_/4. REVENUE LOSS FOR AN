HONEST SELLER
In both of the settings we covered, an honest seller suffers
a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating.
The equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us
to quantify this loss. Although this is as far as we will take
the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings,
in which the seller could, for example, choose the market
in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to
oversee the auction.
In a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an
honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave
their bids. For the case in which agent types are drawn from
the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by
P c
Nâˆ’1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest
seller"s revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.
Analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents
may cheat is not so straightforward. If Pa
= 1 (each agent
cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price
auction, and the seller"s expected revenue will be unchanged.
Again considering the uniform distribution for agent types,
it is not surprising that Pa
= 1
2
causes the seller to lose
79
the most revenue. However, even in this worst case, the
percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than
it is for the second-price auction in which Pc
= 1
2
, as shown
in Table 1.6
It turns out that setting Pc
= 0.2 would make
the expected loss of these two settings comparable. While
this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful
for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of
possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than
agents actually cheating themselves.
