CHEATING SELLER
In this section, we consider a second-price auction in which
the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after 
observing all of the bids. The formulation for this section will be
largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating
in a first-price auction. While no prior knowledge of game
theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can
be found in [2] and [6], respectively.
2.1 Formulation
The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by
i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller. Each agent has a type θi ∈
[0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the
agent"s value for the good being auctioned.2
Each agent"s
type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution
function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable
over the interval [0, 1]. Call the probability density function
(pdf ) f(θi) = F (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf.
Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the 
distribution over the possible types of the other agents. A bidding
strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its
bid.3
Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents,
and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all
types except for that of agent i. We can then combine the
vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i). We also define the vector of
bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without
2
We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss
of generality because any distribution over a different range
can be normalized to this range.

We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies,
but, because of our continuity assumption, there always 
exists a pure strategy equilibrium.
the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i). Let b[1](θ) be the value of the
highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding 
definition for b[1](θ−i).
An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater
than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation. 
Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because
our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability
event in equilibrium. We assume that the seller does not set
a reserve price.4
If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays
the highest bid by another agent. On the other hand, if
the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its
bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full
advantage of its power. Let the indicator variable µc
be 1
if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise. The probability that
the seller cheats, Pc
, is known by all agents.5
We can then
write the payment of the winning agent as follows.
pi(b(θ), µc
) = µc
· bi(θi) − (1 − µc
) · b[1](θ−i) (1)
Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality
as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.
The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction,
and the difference between its valuation and its price if it
does.
ui(b(θ), µc
, θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc
)
(2)
We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent,
with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents
and over whether or not the seller cheats. By pushing the
expectation inward so that it is only over the price 
(conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the
expected utility as:
Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc
, θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) ·
θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc
) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3)
We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility
maximizers. Because of the uncertainty over the types of
the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash 
equilibrium. A vector of bidding strategies b∗
is a Bayes-Nash
equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi,
agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an 
alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies
for all other agents fixed. Formally, b∗
is a Bayes-Nash 
equilibrium if:
∀i, θi, bi Eθ−i,µc ui b∗
i (θi), b∗
−i(θ−i) , µc
, θi ≥
Eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗
−i(θ−i) , µc
, θi (4)
2.2 Equilibrium
We first present the Bayes-Nash equilibrium for an 
arbitrary distribution F(·).

This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be
applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve
price before the auction begins.

Note that common knowledge is not necessary for the 
existence of an equilibrium.

Theorem 1. In a second-price auction in which the seller
cheats with probability Pc
, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for
each agent to bid according to the following strategy:
bi(θi) = θi −
θi
0
F( N−1
P c )
(x)dx
F( N−1
P c )
(θi)
(5)
It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc
. Setting
Pc
= 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see,
e.g., [10]). In the case of Pc
= 0, this solution is not defined.
However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc
approaches
0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a
standard second-price auction.
The position of Pc
is perhaps surprising. For example, the
linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc
·
θi
0 F (N−1)
(x)dx
F (N−1)(θi)
of the
equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price 
auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies
for the cases of Pc
= 0 and Pc
= 1.
2.3 Continuum of Auctions
An alternative perspective on the setting is as a 
continuum between first and second-price auctions. Consider a
probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is 
honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined
by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc
it is his bid,
and with probability 1 − Pc
it is the second-highest bid.
By adjusting Pc
, we can smoothly move between a first
and second-price auction. Furthermore, the fact that this
probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the
Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way
to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the 
symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof
of Theorem 1 in the appendix).
2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution
Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by
instantiating the distribution of types. We now consider the
often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.
Corollary 2. In a second-price auction in which the
seller cheats with probability Pc
, and F(θi) = θi, it is a
Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to
the following strategy:
bi(θi) =
N − 1
N − 1 + Pc
θi (6)
This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc
,
can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known
results. When Pc
= 0 the bidding strategy is now 
welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc
= 1
we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent
bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi.
