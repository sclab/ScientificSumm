Our work was initially motivated by research in the social
sciences indicating that real people seem (irrationally) 
paralyzed when they are presented with additional options. In
this section, we briefly review some of these social-science
experiments and then discuss technical approaches related
to Socratic game theory.
Prima facie, a rational agent"s happiness given an added
option can only increase. However, recent research has found
that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for 
example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more
likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices
and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35]. (See also
[19].) The psychology literature explores a number of 
explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by
comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of
all other options instead of the single best alternative [65],
a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the
other options [67], and so on. The present work explores
an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information
is not free. When there are more options, a decision-maker
must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.
See, e.g., the work of Skyrms [68] for a philosophical 
perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.
Finally, we note the connection between Socratic games and
modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and
necessity.
The observation that human players typically do not play
rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model
partially rational players. The typical model of this 
socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds
on computational power in computing the consequences of
a strategy. The work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58]
differs from the models that we consider here in that instead
of putting hard limitations on the computational power of
the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of
the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and
therefore money/utility) to learn about it.
Partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) are a 
general framework used in AI to model situations of multi-agent
planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the 
generality of POSGs seems to make them very difficult [6]. 
Recent work has been done in developing algorithms for 
restricted classes of POSGs, most notably classes of 
cooperative POSGs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from
the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in
this paper.
The fundamental question in Socratic games is deciding
on the comparative value of making a more costly but more
informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase
and picking the best option, given current information. This
tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts;
a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results
156
from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate
reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take
the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a 
beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference
[33], among many others.
This issue can also be viewed as another perspective on
the general question of exploration versus exploitation that
arises often in AI: when is it better to actively seek 
additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one
already has? (See, e.g., [69].) Most of this work differs
significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent
planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting. A 
notable exception is the work of Larson and Sandholm [41, 42,
43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose
computation is costly and limited. They present a model
in which players must solve a computationally intractable
valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some
hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining
games in this model.
