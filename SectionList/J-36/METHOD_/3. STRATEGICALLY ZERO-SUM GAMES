We can view a Socratic game G with constant-sum worlds
as an exponentially large classical game, with pure 
strategies make query qi and respond according to fi. 
However, this classical game is not constant sum. The sum of
the players" payoffs varies depending upon their strategies,
because different queries incur different costs. However, this
game still has significant structure: the sum of payoffs varies
only because of varying query costs. Thus the sum of 
payoffs does depend on players" choice of strategies, but not on
the interaction of their choices-i.e., for fixed functions gi
and gii, we have ui(q, f) + uii(q, f) = gi(qi, fi) + gii(qii, fii)
for all strategies q, f . Such games are called strategically
zero sum and were introduced by Moulin and Vial [51], who
describe a notion of strategic equivalence and define 
strategically zero-sum games as those strategically equivalent to
zero-sum games. It is interesting to note that two Socratic
games with the same queries and strategically equivalent
worlds are not necessarily strategically equivalent.
A game A, u is strategically zero sum if there exist labels
(i, ai) for every Player i and every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai
152
such that, for all mixed-strategy profiles α, we have that the
sum of the utilities satisfies
ui(α)+uii(α) =
X
ai∈Ai
αi(ai)· (i, ai)+
X
aii∈Aii
αii(aii)· (ii, aii).
Note that any constant-sum game is strategically zero sum
as well.
It is not immediately obvious that one can efficiently 
decide if a given game is strategically zero sum. For 
completeness, we give a characterization of classical strategically
zero-sum games in terms of the rank of a simple matrix 
derived from the game"s payoffs, allowing us to efficiently 
decide if a given game is strategically zero sum and, if it is, to
compute the labels (i, ai).
Theorem 3.1. Consider a game G = A, u with Ai =
{a1
i , . . . , ani
i }. Let MG
be the ni-by-nii matrix whose i, j th
entry MG
(i,j) satisfies log2 MG
(i,j) = ui(ai
i , aj
ii) + uii(ai
i , aj
ii).
Then the following are equivalent:
(i) G is strategically zero sum;
(ii) there exist labels (i, ai) for every player i ∈ {i,ii} and
every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai such that, for all pure
strategies a ∈ A, we have ui(a) + uii(a) = (i, ai) +
(ii, aii); and
(iii) rank(MG
) = 1.
Proof Sketch. (i ⇒ ii) is immediate; every pure 
strategy is a trivially mixed strategy. For (ii ⇒ iii), let ci be the
n-element column vector with jth component 2 (i,a
j
i )
; then
ci · cii
T
= MG
. For (iii ⇒ i), if rank(MG
) = 1, then MG
=
u · vT
. We can prove that G is strategically zero sum by
choosing labels (i, aj
i ) := log2 uj and (ii, aj
ii) := log2 vj.
