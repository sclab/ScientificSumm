Several other researchers have considered very similar text 
classification tasks. Cohen et al. [5] describe an ontology of speech
acts, such as Propose a Meeting, and attempt to predict when an
e-mail contains one of these speech acts. We consider action-items
to be an important specific type of speech act that falls within their
more general classification. While they provide results for 
several classification methods, their methods only make use of human
judgments at the document-level. In contrast, we consider whether
accuracy can be increased by using finer-grained human judgments
that mark the specific sentences and phrases of interest.
Corston-Oliver et al. [6] consider detecting items in e-mail to
Put on a To-Do List. This classification task is very similar to
ours except they do not consider simple factual questions to 
belong to this category. We include questions, but note that not all
questions are action-items - some are rhetorical or simply social
convention, How are you?. From a learning perspective, while
they make use of judgments at the sentence-level, they do not 
explicitly compare what if any benefits finer-grained judgments offer.
Additionally, they do not study alternative choices or approaches to
the classification task. Instead, they simply apply a standard SVM
at the sentence-level and focus primarily on a linguistic analysis of
how the sentence can be logically reformulated before adding it to
the task list. In this study, we examine several alternative 
classification methods, compare document-level and sentence-level 
approaches and analyze the machine learning issues implicit in these
problems.
Interest in a variety of learning tasks related to e-mail has been
rapidly growing in the recent literature. For example, in a forum
dedicated to e-mail learning tasks, Culotta et al. [7] presented 
methods for learning social networks from e-mail. In this work, we do
not focus on peer relationships; however, such methods could 
complement those here since peer relationships often influence word
choice when requesting an action.
