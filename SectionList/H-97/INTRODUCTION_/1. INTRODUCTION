E-mail users are facing an increasingly difficult task of 
managing their inboxes in the face of mounting challenges that result from
rising e-mail usage. This includes prioritizing e-mails over a range
of sources from business partners to family members, filtering and
reducing junk e-mail, and quickly managing requests that demand

Hi All,
I"d like to remind all of you that the group from GRTY will be visiting us
next Friday at 4:30 p.m. The current schedule looks like this:
+ 9:30 a.m. Informal Breakfast and Discussion in Cafeteria
+ 10:30 a.m. Company Overview
+ 11:00 a.m. Individual Meetings (Continue Over Lunch)
+ 2:00 p.m. Tour of Facilities
+ 3:00 p.m. Sales Pitch
In order to have this go off smoothly, I would like to practice the 
presentation well in advance. As a result, I will need each of your parts by
Wednesday.
Keep up the good work!
-Henry

request that requires the recipient"s attention or action.
the receiver"s attention or action. Automated action-item detection
targets the third of these problems by attempting to detect which
e-mails require an action or response with information, and within
those e-mails, attempting to highlight the sentence (or other 
passage length) that directly indicates the action request.
Such a detection system can be used as one part of an e-mail
agent which would assist a user in processing important e-mails
quicker than would have been possible without the agent. We view
action-item detection as one necessary component of a successful
e-mail agent which would perform spam detection, action-item 
detection, topic classification and priority ranking, among other 
functions. The utility of such a detector can manifest as a method of
prioritizing e-mails according to task-oriented criteria other than
the standard ones of topic and sender or as a means of ensuring that
the email user hasn"t dropped the proverbial ball by forgetting to
address an action request.
Action-item detection differs from standard text classification in
two important ways. First, the user is interested both in 
detecting whether an email contains action items and in locating exactly
where these action item requests are contained within the email
body. In contrast, standard text categorization merely assigns a
topic label to each text, whether that label corresponds to an e-mail
folder or a controlled indexing vocabulary [12, 15, 22]. Second,
action-item detection attempts to recover the email sender"s intent
- whether she means to elicit response or action on the part of the
receiver; note that for this task, classifiers using only unigrams as
features do not perform optimally, as evidenced in our results 
below. Instead we find that we need more information-laden features
such as higher-order n-grams. Text categorization by topic, on the
other hand, works very well using just individual words as features
[2, 9, 13, 17]. In fact, genre-classification, which one would think
may require more than a bag-of-words approach, also works quite
well using just unigram features [14]. Topic detection and 
tracking (TDT), also works well with unigram feature sets [1, 20]. We
believe that action-item detection is one of the first clear instances
of an IR-related task where we must move beyond bag-of-words
to achieve high performance, albeit not too far, as bag-of-n-grams
seem to suffice.
We first review related work for similar text classification 
problems such as e-mail priority ranking and speech act identification.
Then we more formally define the action-item detection problem,
discuss the aspects that distinguish it from more common problems
like topic classification, and highlight the challenges in 
constructing systems that can perform well at the sentence and document
level. From there, we move to a discussion of feature 
representation and selection techniques appropriate for this problem and how
standard text classification approaches can be adapted to smoothly
move from the sentence-level detection problem to the 
documentlevel classification problem. We then conduct an empirical analysis
that helps us determine the effectiveness of our feature extraction
procedures as well as establish baselines for a number of 
classification algorithms on this task. Finally, we summarize this paper"s
contributions and consider interesting directions for future work.
