Distributed applications require distributed techniques for
efficient resource allocation. These techniques need to take
into account the heterogeneity and potential unreliability of
resources and resource consumers in a distributed 
environments. In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm that
solves the resource allocation problem in distributed 
multiagent systems. Our solution is based on the self-organisation
of agents, which does not require any facilitator or 
management layer. The resource allocation in the system is a purely
emergent effect. We present results of the proposed resource
allocation mechanism in the simulated static and dynamic
multi-server environment.
