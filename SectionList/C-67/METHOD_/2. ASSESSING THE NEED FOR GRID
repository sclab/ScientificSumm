COMPUTING
Effective use of a grid requires a computation that can be divided
into independent (i.e., parallel) tasks. The results of each task
cannot depend on the results of any other task, and so the
members of the grid can solve the tasks in parallel. Once the tasks
have been completed, the results can be assembled into the
solution. Examples of parallelizable computations are the
Mandelbrot set of fractals, the Monte Carlo calculations used in
disciplines such as Solid State Physics, and the individual frames
of a rendered animation. This paper is concerned with the last
example.
2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid
Computing
The applications used in grid computing must either be
specifically designed for grid use, or scriptable in such a way that
they can receive data from the grid, process the data, and then
return results. In other words, the best candidates for grid
computing are applications that run the same or very similar
computations on a large number of pieces of data without any
dependencies on the previous calculated results. Applications
heavily dependent on data handling rather than processing power
are generally more suitable to run on a traditional environment
than on a grid platform. Of course, the applications must also run
on the computing platform that hosts the grid. Our interest is in
using the Alias Maya application [3] with Apple"s Xgrid [4] on
Mac OS X.
Commercial applications usually have strict license requirements.
This is an important concern if we install a commercial
application such as Maya on all members of our grid. By its
nature, the size of the grid may change as the number of idle
computers changes. How many licenses will be required? Our
resolution of this issue will be discussed in a later section.
2.2 Integration into the Existing
Infrastructure
The grid requires a controller that recognizes when grid members
are available, and parses out job to available members. The
controller must be able to see members on the network. This does
not require that members be on the same subnet as the controller,
but if they are not, any intervening firewalls and routers must be
configured to allow grid traffic.
