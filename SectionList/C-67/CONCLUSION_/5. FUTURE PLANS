Maya on Xgrid is not yet ready to be used by the students of
Ringling School. In order to do this, we must address at least the
following concerns.
• Continue our rendering tests through the command line
rather than the GUI plug-in. This will be essential for the
following step.
• Develop an appropriate interface for users to send jobs to the
Xgrid controller. This will probably be an extension to the
web interface of our existing render farm, where the student
specifies parameters that are placed in a script that issues the
Render command.
• Perform timed Maya rendering tests with Xgrid. Part of this
should compare the rendering times for Power Mac G4"s and
G5"s.
