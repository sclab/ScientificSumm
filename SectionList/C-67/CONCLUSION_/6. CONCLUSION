Grid computing continues to advance. Recently, the IT industry
has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary
grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for
compute intensive applications. For instance, peer-to-peer
applications such as Kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not
share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap
files between systems. Although in our campuses we discourage
students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music
sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as
decision support and data mining. The National Virtual
Collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers
across the U.S. with computing resources, allowing them to share
extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together
as virtual teams over the Internet.
There is an assortment of new grid players in the IT world
expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid
technology to the next level. SAP [14] is piloting a project to
grid-enable SAP ERP applications, Dell [15] has partnered with
Platform Computing to consolidate computing resources and
provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications,
Oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g
release [16], United Devices [17] offers hosting service for 
gridon-demand, and Sun Microsystems continues their research and
development of Sun"s N1 Grid engine [18] which combines grid
and clustering platforms.
Simply, the grid computing is up and coming. The potential
benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education
learning while the implementation costs are low. Today, it would
be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on
investment as grid computing in information technology divisions
in higher education institutions. It is a mistake to overlook this
technology with such a high payback.
