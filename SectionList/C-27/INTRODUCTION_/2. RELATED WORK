In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major
categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either
expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less
accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only
connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of
proximity among the nodes.
The localization problem is a fundamental research problem in
many domains. In the field of robotics, it has been studied
extensively [9] [10]. The reported localization errors are on the
order of tens of centimeters, when using specialized ranging
hardware, i.e. laser range finder or ultrasound. Due to the high cost
and non-negligible form factor of the ranging hardware, these
solutions can not be simply applied to sensor networks.
The RSSI has been an attractive solution for estimating the
distance between the sender and the receiver. The RADAR system
[2] uses the RSSI to build a centralized repository of signal
strengths at various positions with respect to a set of beacon nodes.
The location of a mobile user is estimated within a few meters. In
a similar approach, MoteTrack [17] distributes the reference RSSI
values to the beacon nodes.
Solutions that use RSSI and do not require beacon nodes have
also been proposed [5] [14] [24] [26] [29]. They all share the idea
of using a mobile beacon. The sensor nodes that receive the
beacons, apply different algorithms for inferring their location. In
[29], Sichitiu proposes a solution in which the nodes that receive
the beacon construct, based on the RSSI value, a constraint on
their position estimate. In [26], Priyantha et al. propose MAL, a
localization method in which a mobile node (moving strategically)
assists in measuring distances between node pairs, until the
constraints on distances generate a rigid graph. In [24], Pathirana
et al. formulate the localization problem as an on-line estimation in
a nonlinear dynamic system and proposes a Robust Extended
Kalman Filter for solving it. Elnahrawy [8] provides strong
evidence of inherent limitations of localization accuracy using
RSSI, in indoor environments.
A more precise ranging technique uses the time difference
between a radio signal and an acoustic wave, to obtain pair wise
distances between sensor nodes. This approach produces smaller
localization errors, at the cost of additional hardware. The Cricket
location-support system [25] can achieve a location granularity of
tens of centimeters with short range ultrasound transceivers.
AHLoS, proposed by Savvides et al. [27], employs Time of
Arrival (ToA) ranging techniques that require extensive hardware
and solving relatively large nonlinear systems of equations. A
similar ToA technique is employed in [3].
In [30], Simon et al. implement a distributed system (using
acoustic ranging) which locates a sniper in an urban terrain.
Acoustic ranging for localization is also used by Kwon et al. [15].
The reported errors in localization vary from 2.2m to 9.5m,
depending on the type (centralized vs. distributed) of the Least
Square Scaling algorithm used.
For wireless sensor networks ranging is a difficult option. The
hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small
range, all are difficult compromises, and it is hard to envision
cheap, unreliable and resource-constraint devices make use of
range-based localization solutions. However, the high localization
accuracy, achievable by these schemes is very desirable.
To overcome the challenges posed by the range-based
localization schemes, when applied to sensor networks, a different
approach has been proposed and evaluated in the past. This
approach is called range-free and it attempts to obtain location
information from the proximity to a set of known beacon nodes.
Bulusu et al. propose in [4] a localization scheme, called
Centroid, in which each node localizes itself to the centroid of its
proximate beacon nodes. In [13], He et al. propose APIT, a scheme
in which each node decides its position based on the possibility of
being inside or outside of a triangle formed by any three beacon
nodes heard by the node. The Global Coordinate System [20],
developed at MIT, uses apriori knowledge of the node density in
the network, to estimate the average hop distance. The DV-*
family of localization schemes [21], uses the hop count from
known beacon nodes to the nodes in the network to infer the
distance. The majority of range-free localization schemes have
been evaluated in simulations, or controlled environments. Several
studies [11] [32] [34] have emphasized the challenges that real
environments pose. Langendoen and Reijers present a detailed,
comparative study of several localization schemes in [16].
To the best of our knowledge, Spotlight is the first range-free
localization scheme that works very well in an outdoor
environment. Our system requires a line of sight between a single
device and the sensor nodes, and the map of the terrain where the
sensor field is located. The Spotlight system has a long effective
range (1000"s meters) and does not require any infrastructure or
additional hardware for sensor nodes. The Spotlight system
combines the advantages and does not suffer from the
disadvantages of the two localization classes.
