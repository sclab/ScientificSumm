In this section we present the performance evaluation of the
Spotlight systems when using the three event distribution
functions, i.e. Point Scan, Line Scan and Area Cover, described in
Section 3.
19
For the µSpotlight system we used 10 Mica2 motes. The sensor
nodes were attached to a vertically positioned Veltex board. By
projecting the light to the sensor nodes, we are able to generate
well controlled Point, Line and Area events. The Spotlight device
was able to generate events, i.e. project light patterns, covering an
area of approximate size 180x140cm2
. The screen resolution for
the projector was 1024x768, and the movement of the Point Scan
and Line Scan techniques was done through increments (in the
appropriate direction) of 10 pixels between events.
Each experimental point was obtained from 10 successive runs
of the localization procedure. Each set of 10 runs was preceded by
a calibration phase, aimed at estimating the total delays (between
the Spotlight device and each sensor node) in detecting an event.
During the calibration, we created an event covering the entire
sensor field (illuminated the entire area). The timestamp reported
by each sensor node, in conjunction with the timestamp created by
the Spotlight device were used to obtain the time offset, for each
sensor node. More sophisticated calibration procedures have been
reported previously [35]. In addition to the time offset, we added a
manually configurable parameter, called bias. It was used to best
estimate the center of an event.
Figure 13. Deployment site for the Spotlight system
For the Spotlight system evaluation, we deployed 10 XSM
motes in a football field. The site is shown in Figure 13 (laser
beams are depicted with red arrows and sensor nodes with white
dots). Two sets of experiments were run, with the Spotlight device
positioned at 46m and at 170m from the sensor field. The sensor
nodes were aligned and the Spotlight device executed a Point
Scan. The localization system computed the coordinates of the
sensor nodes, and the Spotlight device was oriented, through a
GoTo command sent to the telescope mount, towards the
computed location. In the initial stages of the experiments, we
manually measured the localization error.
For our experimental evaluation, the metrics of interest were as
follows:
- Localization error, defined as the distance, between the real
location and the one obtained from the Spotlight system.
- Localization duration, defined as the time span between the first
and last event.
- Localization range, defined as the maximum distance between
the Spotlight device and the sensor nodes.
- A Localization Cost function Cost:{{localization accuracy},
{localization duration}} → [0,1] quantifies the trade-off between
the accuracy in localization and the localization duration. The
objective is to minimize the Localization Cost function. By
denoting with ei the localization error for the ith
scenario, with di
the localization duration for the ith
scenario, with max(e) the
maximum localization error, with max(d) the maximum
localization duration, and with α the importance factor, the
Localization Cost function is formally defined as:
)max(
)1(
)max(
),(

- Localization Bias. This metric is used to investigate the
effectiveness of the calibration procedure. If, for example, all
computed locations have a bias in the west direction, a calibration
factor can be used to compensate for the difference.
The parameters that we varied during the performance
evaluation of our system were: the type of scanning (Point, Line
and Area), the size of the event, the duration of the event (for Area
Cover), the scanning speed, the power of the laser and the distance
between the Spotlight device and sensor field, to estimate the
range of the system.
5.1 Point Scan - μSpotlight system
In this experiment, we investigated how the size of the event and
the scanning speed affect the localization error. Figure 14 shows
the mean localization errors with their standard deviations.
It can be observed, that while the scanning speed, varying
between 35cm/sec and 87cm/sec has a minor influence on the
localization accuracy, the size of the event has a dramatic effect.

The obtained localization error varied from as little as 2cm to
over 11cm for the largest event. This dependence can be explained
by our Event Detection algorithm: the first detection above a
threshold gave the timestamp for the event.
The duration of the localization scheme is shown in Figure 15.
The dependency of the localization duration on the size of the
event and scanning speed is natural. A bigger event allows a
reduction in the total duration of up to 70%. The localization
duration is directly proportional to the scanning speed, as
expected, and depicted in Figure 15.

An interesting trade-off is between the localization accuracy
(usually the most important factor), and the localization time
(important in environments where stealthiness is paramount).
Figure 16 shows the Localization Cost function, for α = 0.5
(accuracy and duration are equally important).
As shown in Figure 16, it can be observed that an event size of
approximately 10-15cm (depending on the scanning speed)
minimizes our Cost function. For α = 1, the same graph would be a
monotonically increasing function, while for α = 0, it would be
monotonically decreasing function.

5.2 Line Scan - μSpotlight system
In a similar manner to the Point Scan EDF, for the Line Scan EDF
we were interested in the dependency of the localization error and
duration on the size of the event and scanning speed.
We represent in Figure 17 the localization error for different
event sizes. It is interesting to observe the dependency (concave
shape) of the localization error vs. the event size. Moreover, a
question that should arise is why the same dependency was not
observed in the case of Point Scan EDF.

The explanation for this concave dependency is the existence of
a bias in location estimation. As a reminder, a bias factor was
introduced in order to best estimate the central point of events that
have a large size. What Figure 17 shows is the fact that the bias
factor was optimal for an event size of approximately 7cm. For
events smaller and larger than this, the bias factor was too large,
and too small, respectively. Thus, it introduced biased errors in the
position estimation.
The reason why we did not observe the same dependency in the
case of the Point Scan EDF was that we did not experiment with
event sizes below 7cm, due to the long time it would have taken to
scan the entire field with events as small as 1.7cm.
The results for the localization duration as a function of the size
of the event are shown in Figure 18. As shown, the localization
duration is directly proportional to the scanning speed. The size of
the event has a smaller influence on the localization duration. One
can remark the average localization duration of about 10sec, much
shorter then the duration obtained in the Point Scan experiment.
The Localization Cost function dependency on the event size
and scanning speed, for α=0.5, is shown in Figure 19. The
dependency on the scanning speed is very small (the Cost Function
achieves a minimum in the same 4-6cm range). It is interesting to
note that this 4-6cm optimal event size is smaller than the one
observed in the case of Point Scan EDF. The explanation for this is
that the smaller localization duration observed in the Line Scan
EDF, allowed a shift (towards smaller event sizes) in the total
Localization Cost Function.

EDF
During our experiments with the Line Scan EDF, we observed
evidence of a bias in location estimation. The estimated locations
for all sensor nodes exhibited different biases, for different event
sizes. For example, for an event size of 17.5cm, the estimated
location for sensor nodes was to the upper-left size of the actual
location. This was equivalent to an early detection, since our
scanning was done from left to right and from top to bottom. The
scanning speed did not influence the bias.
In order to better understand the observed phenomena, we
analyzed our data. Figure 20 shows the bias in the horizontal
direction, for different event sizes (the vertical bias was almost
identical, and we omit it, due to space constraints).
From Figure 20, one can observe that the smallest observed
bias, and hence the most accurate positioning, was for an event of
size 7cm. These results are consistent with the observed
localization error, shown in Figure 17.
We also adjusted the measured localization error (shown in
Figure 17) for the observed bias (shown in Figure 20). The results
of an ideal case of Spotlight Localization system with Line Scan
EDF are shown in Figure 21. The errors are remarkably small,
varying between 0.1cm and 0.8cm, with a general trend of higher
localization errors for larger event sizes.

5.3 Area Cover - μSpotlight system
In this experiment, we investigated how the number of bits used to
quantify the entire sensor field, affected the localization accuracy.
In our first experiment we did not use error correcting codes. The
results are shown in Figure 22.

Cover EDF
One can observe a remarkable accuracy, with localization error
on the order of 0.3-0.6cm. What is important to observe is the
variance in the localization error. In the scenario where 12 bits
were used, while the average error was very small, there were a
couple of cases, where an incorrect event detection generated a
larger than expected error. An example of how this error can occur
was described in Section 3.4. The experimental results, presented
in Figure 22, emphasize the need for error correction of the bit
patterns observed and reported by the sensor nodes.
The localization duration results are shown in Figure 23. It can
be observed that the duration is directly proportional with the
number of bits used, with total durations ranging from 3sec, for the
least accurate method, to 6-7sec for the most accurate. The
duration of an event had a small influence on the total localization
time, when considering the same scenario (same number of bits for
the code).
The Cost Function dependency on the number of bits in the
code, for α=0.5, is shown in Figure 24. Generally, since the
localization duration for the Area Scan can be extremely small, a
higher accuracy in the localization is desired. While the Cost
function achieves a minimum when 10 bits are used, we attribute
the slight increase observed when 12 bits were used to the two 
12bit scenarios where larger than the expected errors were observed,
namely 6-7mm (as shown in Figure 22).

The two problematic scenarios (shown in Figure 22, where for
12-bit codes we observed errors larger than the event size, due to
errors in detection) were further explored by using error correction
codes. As described in Section 3.3, we implemented an extended
Golay (24, 12) error correction mechanism in our location
estimation algorithm.
The experimental results are depicted in Figure 25, and show a
consistent accuracy. The scenario without error correction codes,
is simply the same 12-bit code scenario, shown in Figure 22. We
only investigated the 12-bit scenario, due to its match with the 
12bit data required by the Golay encoding scheme (extended Golay
producing 24-bit codewords).

5.4 Point Scan - Spotlight system
In this section we describe the experiments performed at a football
stadium, using our Spotlight system. The hardware that we had
available allowed us to evaluate the Point Scan technique of the
Spotlight system. In our evaluation, we were interested to see the
performance of the system at different ranges. Figures 26 and 27
show the localization error versus the event size at two different
ranges: 46m and 170m.
Figure 26 shows a remarkable accuracy in localization. The
errors are in the centimeter range. Our initial, manual
measurements of the localization error were most of the time
difficult to make, since the spot of the laser was almost perfectly
covering the XSM mote. We are able to achieve localization errors
of a few centimeters, which only range-based localization schemes
are able to achieve [25]. The observed dependency on the size of
the event is similar to the one observed in the μSpotlight system
evaluation, and shown in Figure 14. This proved that the
μSpotlight system is a viable alternative for investigating complex
EDFs, without incurring the costs for the necessary hardware.

In the experiments performed over a much longer distance
between the Spotlight device and sensor network, the average
localization error remains very small. Localization errors of 
510cm were measured, as Figure 27 shows. We were simply
amazed by the accuracy that the system is capable of, when
considering that the Spotlight system operated over the length of a
football stadium. Throughout our experimentation with the
Spotlight system, we have observed localization errors that were
simply offsets of real locations. Since the same phenomenon was
observed when experimenting with the μSpotlight system, we
believe that with auto-calibration, the localization error can be
further reduced.

Figure 27. Localization Error vs. Event Size for Spotlight
system at 170m
The time required for localization using the Spotlight system
with a Point Scan EDF, is given by: t=(L*l)/(s*Es), where L and l
are the dimensions of the sensor network field, s is the scanning
speed, and Es is the size of the event. Figure 28 shows the time for
localizing a sensor network deployed in an area of size of a
football field using the Spotlight system. Here we ignore the
message propagation time, from the sensor nodes to the Spotlight
device.
From Figure 28 it can be observed that the very small
localization errors are prohibitively expensive in the case of the
Point Scan. When localization errors of up to 1m are tolerable,
localization duration can be as low as 4 minutes. Localization
durations of 5-10 minutes, and localization errors of 1m are
currently state of art in the realm of range-free localization
schemes. And these results are achieved by using the Point Scan
scheme, which required the highest Localization Time, as it was
shown in Table 1.

Figure 28. Localization Time vs. Event Size for Spotlight
system
One important characteristic of the Spotlight system is its range.
The two most important factors are the sensitivity of the
photosensor and the power of the Spotlight source. We were
interested in measuring the range of our Spotlight system,
considering our capabilities (MTS310 sensor board and
inexpensive, $12-$85, diode laser). As a result, we measured the
intensity of the laser beam, having the same focus, at different
distances. The results are shown in Figure 29.

Figure 29. Localization Range for the Spotlight system
From Figure 29, it can be observed that only a minor decrease
in the intensity occurs, due to absorption and possibly our
imperfect focusing of the laser beam. A linear fit of the
experimental data shows that distances of up to 6500m can be
achieved. While we do not expect atmospheric conditions, over
large distances, to be similar to our 200m evaluation, there is
strong evidence that distances (i.e. altitude) of 1000-2000m can
easily be achieved. The angle between the laser beam and the
vertical should be minimized (less than 45°), as it reduces the
difference between the beam cross-section (event size) and the
actual projection of the beam on the ground.
In a similar manner, we were interested in finding out the
maximum size of an event, that can be generated by a COTS laser
and that is detectable by the existing photosensor. For this, we
23
varied the divergence of the laser beam and measured the light
intensity, as given by the ADC count. The results are shown in
Figure 30. It can be observed that for the less powerful laser, an
event size of 1.5m is the limit. For the more powerful laser, the
event size can be as high as 4m.
Through our extensive performance evaluation results, we have
shown that the Spotlight system is a feasible, highly accurate, low
cost solution for localization of wireless sensor networks. From
our experience with sources of laser radiation, we believe that for
small and medium size sensor network deployments, in areas of
less than 20,000m2
, the Area Cover scheme is a viable solution.
For large size sensor network deployments, the Line Scan, or an
incremental use of the Area Cover are very good options.
