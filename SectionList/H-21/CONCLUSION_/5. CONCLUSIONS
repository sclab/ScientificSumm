Query classification is an important information retrieval
task. Accurate classification of search queries is likely to
benefit a number of higher-level tasks such as Web search
and ad matching. Since search queries are usually short, by
themselves they usually carry insufficient information for 
adequate classification accuracy. To address this problem, we
proposed a methodology for using search results as a source
of external knowledge. To this end, we send the query to a
search engine, and assume that a plurality of the 
highestranking search results are relevant to the query. Classifying
these results then allows us to classify the original query
with substantially higher accuracy.
The results of our empirical evaluation definitively 
confirmed that using the Web as a repository of world 
knowledge contributes valuable information about the query, and
aids in its correct classification. Notably, our method 
exhibits significantly higher accuracy than methods described
in prior studies3
Compared to prior studies, our approach
does not require any auxiliary taxonomy, and we produce
a query classifier directly for the target taxonomy. 
Furthermore, the taxonomy used in this study is approximately
2 orders of magnitude larger than that used in prior works.
We also experimented with different values of parameters
that characterize our method. When using search results,
one can either use only summaries of the results provided by

the search engine, or actually crawl the results pages for even
deeper knowledge. Overall, query classification performance
was the best when using the full crawled pages (Table 1).
These results are consistent with prior studies [5], which
found that using full crawled pages is superior for document
classification than using only brief summaries. Our findings,
however, are different from those reported by Shen et al. [19],
who found summaries to yield better results. We attribute
our observations to using a more elaborate voting scheme
among the classifications of individual search results, as well
as to using a more difficult set of rare queries.
In this study we used two major search engines, A and B.
Interestingly, we found notable distinctions in the quality of
their output. Notably, for engine A the overall results were
better when using the full crawled pages of the search 
results, while for engine B it seems to be more beneficial to use
the summaries of results. This implies that while the quality
of search results returned by engine A is apparently better,
engine B does a better work in summarizing the pages.
We also found that the best results were obtained by 
using full crawled pages and performing voting among their
individual classifications. For a classifier that is external to
the search engine, retrieving full pages may be prohibitively
costly, in which case one might prefer to use summaries to
gain computational efficiency. On the other hand, for the
owners of a search engine, full page classification is much
more efficient, since it is easy to preprocess all indexed pages
by classifying them once onto the (fixed) taxonomy. Then,
page classifications are obtained as part of the meta-data
associated with each search result, and query classification
can be nearly instantaneous.
When using summaries it appears that better results are
obtained by first concatenating individual summaries into a
meta-document, and then using its classification as a whole.
We believe the reason for this observation is that summaries
are short and inherently noisier, and hence their aggregation
helps to correctly identify the main theme. Consistent with
our intuition, using too few search results yields useful but
insufficient knowledge, and using too many search results
leads to inclusion of marginally relevant Web pages. The
best results were obtained when using 40 top search hits.
In this work, we first classify search results, and then use
their classifications directly to classify the original query.
Alternatively, one can use the classifications of search results
as features in order to learn a second-level classifier. In
Section 3.6, we did some preliminary experiments in this
direction, and found that learning such a secondary classifier
did not yield considerably advantages. We plan to further
investigate this direction in our future work.
It is also essential to note that implementing our 
methodology incurs little overhead. If the search engine classifies
crawled pages during indexing, then at query time we only
need to fetch these classifications and do the voting.
To conclude, we believe our methodology for using Web
search results holds considerable promise for substantially
improving the accuracy of Web search queries. This is 
particularly important for rare queries, for which little 
perquery learning can be done, and in this study we proved
that such scarceness of information could be addressed by
leveraging the knowledge found on the Web. We believe
our findings will have immediate applications to improving
the handling of rare queries, both for improving the search
results as well as yielding better matched advertisements.
In our further research we also plan to make use of session
information in order to leverage knowledge about previous
queries to better classify subsequent ones.
