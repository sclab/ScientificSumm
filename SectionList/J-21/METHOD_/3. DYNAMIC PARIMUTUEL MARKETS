The dynamic parimutuel market (DPM) was introduced
by Pennock [10] as an information market structure that 
encourages informed traders to trade early, has guaranteed 
liquidity, and requires a bounded subsidy. This market 
structure was used in the Yahoo! Buzz market [8]. In this 
section, we show that the dynamic parimutuel market is also
remarkably similar to the projection game. Coupled with
section 4, this also demonstrates a strong connection 
between the DPM and MSR.
In a two-event DPM, users can place bets on either event
A or B at any time, by buying a share in the appropriate
event. The price of a share is variable, determined by the
total amount of money in the market and the number of
shares currently outstanding. Further, existing shares can
be sold at the current price. After it is determined which
event really happens, the shares are liquidated for cash. In
the total-money-redistributed variant of DPM, which is
the variant used in the Yahoo! market, the total money
is divided equally among the shares of the winning event;
shares of the losing event are worthless. Note that the 
payoffs are undefined if the event has zero outstanding shares;
the DPM rules should preclude this possibility.
We use the following notation: Let x be the number of
outstanding shares of A (totalled over all traders), and y be
the number of outstanding shares in B. Let M denote the
total money currently in the market. Let cA and cB denote
the prices of shares in A and B respectively. The price of a
share in the Yahoo! DPM is determined by the share-ratio
principle:
cA
cB
=
x
y
(1)
The form of the prices can be fully determined by 
stipulating that, for any given value of M, x, and y, there must
be some probability pA such that, if a trader believes that
pA is the probability that A will occur and the market will
liquidate in the current state, she cannot expect to profit
from either buying or selling either share. This gives us
cA = pA
hM

cB = pB

Since pA + pB = 1, we have:
xcA + ycB = M (2)
Finally, combining Equations 1 and 2, we get
cA = x

cB = y

Cost of a trade in the DPM Consider a trader who
comes to a DPM in state (M, x, y), and buys or sells shares
such that the eventual state is (M , x , y ). What is the net
cost, M − M, of her move?
Theorem 4. The cost of the move from (x, y) to (x , y )
is
M − M = M0[
p
x 2 + y 2 −
p
x2 + y2]
for some constant M0. In other words, it is a constant 
multiple of the corresponding cost in the projection game.
Proof. Consider the function G(x, y) = M0[
p
x2 + y2].
The function G is differentiable for all x, y = 0, and it"s
partial derivatives are:
∂G
∂x
= M0[
x
p
x2 + y2
] = x
G(x, y)
x2 + y2
∂G
∂y
= M0[
y
p
x2 + y2
] = y
G(x, y)
x2 + y2
Now, compare these equations to the prices in the DPM,
and observe that, as a trader buys or sells in the DPM,
the instantaneous price is the derivative of the money. It
follows that, if at any point of time the DPM is in a state
(M, x, y) such that M = G(x, y), then, at all subsequent
points of time, the state (M , x , y ) of the DPM will satisfy
M = G(x , y ). Finally, note that we can pick the constant
M0 such that the equation is satisfied for the initial state of
the DPM, and hence, it will always be satisfied.
One important consequence of Theorem 4 is that the 
dynamic parimutuel market is arbitrage-free (using Lemma 1).
It is interesting to note that the original Yahoo! Buzz market
used a different pricing rule, which did permit arbitrage; the
price rule was changed to the share-ratio rule after traders
started exploiting the arbitrage opportunities [8]. Another
somewhat surprising consequence is that the numbers of 
outstanding shares x, y completely determines the total 
capitalization M of the DPM.
Constraints in the DPM Although it might seem, based
on the costs, that any move in the projection game has an
equivalent move in the DPM, the DPM places some 
constraints on trades. Firstly, no trader is allowed to have a
net negative holding in either share. This is important, 
because it ensures that the total holdings in each share are
always positive. However, this is a boundary constraint,
and does not impact the strategic choices for a player with
a sufficiently large positive holding in each share. Thus, we
can ignore this constraint from a first-order strategic 
analysis of the DPM. Secondly, for practical reasons a DPM will
probably have a minimum unit of trade, but we assume here
that arbitrarily small quantities can be traded.
Payoffs in the DPM At some point, trading in the DPM
ceases and shares are liquidated. We assume here that the
true probability becomes known at liquidation time, and 
describe the payoffs in terms of the probability; however, if the
probability is not revealed, only the event that actually 
occurs, these payoffs can be implemented in expectation. 
Suppose the DPM terminates in a state (M, x, y), and the true
probability of event A is p. When the dynamic parimutuel
market is liquidated, the shares are paid off in the 
following way: Each owner of a share of A receives pM
x
, and each
owner of a share of B receives (1 − p)M
y
, for each share
owned.
The payoffs in the DPM, although given by a fairly 
simple form, are conceptually complex, because the payoff of
a move depends on the subsequent moves before the 
market liquidates. Thus, a fully rational choice of move in the
DPM for player i should take into account the actions of
subsequent players, including player i himself.
Here, we restrict the analysis to myopic, infinitesimal 
strategies: Given the market position is (M, x, y), in which 
direction should a player make an infinitesimal move in order to
maximize her profit? We show that the infinitesimal payoffs
and profits of a DPM with true probability p correspond
strategically to the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a 
projection game with odds
p
p/(1 − p), in the following sense:
Lemma 5. Suppose player i is about to make a move in
a dynamic parimutuel market in a state (M, x, y), and the
true probability of event A is p. Then, assuming the market
is liquidated after i"s move,
• If x
y
<
q
p
1−p
, player i profits by buying shares in A ,
or selling shares in B.
• If x
y
>
q
p
1−p
, player i profits by selling shares in A,
or buying shares in B.
Proof. Consider the cost and payoff of buying a small
quantity Δx of shares in A. The cost is C[(x, y) → (x +
Δx, y)] = Δx · x M
x2+y2 , and the payoff is Δx · pM
x
. Thus,
buying the shares is profitable iff
Δx · x
M
x2 + y2
< Δx · p

Thus, buying A is profitable if x
y
<
q
p
1−p
, and selling A
is profitable if x
y
>
q
p
1−p
. The analysis for buying or selling
B is similar, with p and (1 − p) interchanged.
It follows from Lemma 5 that it is myopically profitable
for players to move towards the line with slope
q
1−p
p
. Note
that there is a one-to-one mapping between 1−p
p
and
q
1−p
p
320
in their respective ranges, so this line is uniquely defined,
and each such line also corresponds to a unique p. 
However, because the actual payoff of a move depends on the 
future moves, players must base their decisions on some belief
about the final state of the market. In the light of Lemma 5,
one natural, rational-expectation style assumption is that
the final state (M, x∗
, y∗
) will satisfy x∗
y∗ =
q
p
1−p
. (In other
words, one might assume that the traders" beliefs will 
ultimately converge to the true probability p; knowing p, the
traders will drive the market state to satisfy x
y
=
q
p
1−p
.)
This is very plausible in markets (such as the Yahoo! Buzz
market) in which trading is permitted right until the market
is liquidated, at which point there is no remaining 
uncertainty about the relevant frequencies. Under this 
assumption, we can prove an even tighter connection between 
payoffs in the DPM (where the true probability is p) and payoffs
in the projection game, with odds
q
p
1−p
:
Theorem 6. Suppose that the DPM ultimately terminates
in a state (M, X, Y ) satisfying X
Y
=
q
p
1−p
. Assume 
without loss of generality that the constant M0 = 1, so M =√
X2 + Y 2. Then, the final payoff for any move [x → x ]
made in the course of trading is (x − x) · (
√
p,
√
1 − p), i.e.,
it is the same as the payoff in the projection game with oddsq
p
1−p
.
Proof. First, observe that X

The final payoff is the liquidation value of (x − x) shares of
A and (y − y) shares of B, which is

Strategic Analysis for the DPM Theorems 4 and 6
give us a very strong equivalence between the projection
game and the dynamic parimutuel market, under the 
assumption that the DPM converges to the optimal value for
the true probability. A player playing in a DPM with true
odds p/(1 − p), can imagine himself playing in the 
projection game with odds
q
p
1−p
, because both the costs and the
payoffs of any given move are identical.
Using this equivalence, we can transfer all the strategic
properties proven for the projection game directly to the
analysis of the dynamic parimutuel market. One 
particularly interesting conclusion we can draw is as follows: In
the absence of any constraint that disallows it, it is always
profitable for an agent to move towards the origin, by selling
shares in both A and B while maintaining the ratio x/y. In
the DPM, this is limited by forbidding short sales, so 
players can never have negative holdings in either share. As a
result, when their holding in one share (say A) is 0, they
can"t use the strategy of moving towards the origin. We can
conclude that a rational player should never hold shares of
both A and B simultaneously, regardless of her beliefs and
the market position.
This discussion leads us to consider a modified DPM, in
which this strategic loophole is addressed directly: Instead
of disallowing all short sales, we place a constraint that no
agent ever reduce the total market capitalization M (or, 
alternatively, that any agent"s total investment in the market
is always non-negative). We call this the nondecreasing
market capitalization constraint for the DPM. This 
corresponds to a restriction that no move in the projection game
reduces the radius. However, we can conclude from the 
preceding discussion that players have no incentive to ever 
increase the radius. Thus, the moves of the projection game
would all lie on the quarter circle in the positive quadrant,
with radius determined by the market maker"s move. In
section 4, we show that the projection game on this 
quarter circle is strategically equivalent (at least myopically) to
trade in a Market Scoring Rule. Thus, the DPM and MSR
appear to be deeply connected to each other, like different
interfaces to the same underlying game.
