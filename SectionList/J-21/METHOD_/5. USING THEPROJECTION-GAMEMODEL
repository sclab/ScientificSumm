The chief advantages of the projection game are that it
is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize. In 
Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to
prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic 
properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise.
In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the
power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about
more complex strategic settings.

5.1 Traders with inertia
The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the
market forms we have studied asserts that traders who 
disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from
changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to
trade in the market. The expected gain may, however, be
very small. A plausible model of real trader behavior might
include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume
that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than
some constant . We do not attempt to justify this model
here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be
used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how
to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.
Consider the simple projection game restricted to a 
circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this 
corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and
to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable 
constraint. Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a
trader believes the true probability is p . Then, his expected
gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit
vectors in the directions of p and p respectively. The 
expected profit is given by E = φ(q, p ) = 1− q ·q . Thus, the
trader will trade only if 1−q·q > . If we let θ and θ be the
angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis),
we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor
series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2
/2. Thus,
we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy:
The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2
≤ 2 .
Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation
wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market. One natural
approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.
This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection
game, and would indeed improve the accuracy. However, it
will also increase the market-maker"s exposure to loss: the
market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve
this.
The projection game model suggests a natural approach
to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds
on the market maker"s loss. The idea is that, instead of
restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force
each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous
move. Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r,
the next trader has to move to r + 1. Then, the trader"s
expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )). Using
the same approximation as above, the trader would trade
as long as (θ − θ )2
> 2 /r. Now, even if the market maker
seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each
trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase
with every trade.
5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies
Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader
strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not
consider the impact of their trades on other traders" 
beliefs. In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit
by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders,
in a way that allows her to profit later. In this section, we
illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze
an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules
that mitigate this effect.
The scenario we consider is as follows. There are two
traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who
each get a 1-bit signal. The optimal probability for each 
2bit signal pair is as follows. If trader 1 gets the signal 0, and
trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.3. If trader
1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is
0.9. If trader 1 gets 1, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal
probability is 0.7. If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the
optimal probability is 0.1. (Note that the impact of trader
2"s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1"s
signal). Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is
that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2
gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.
The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a
circular arc. This setup is depicted in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Example illustrating non-myopic 
deception
Suppose that, for some exogenous reason, trader 1 has the
opportunity to trade, followed by trader 2. Then, trader 1
has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before
the market closes. If traders were playing their myopically
optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If
trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is
between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then
infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if
she got 1 or 0 respectively. Trader 1 has no reason to move
again. If trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a different
point X instead, and trader 2 would move to D if she saw 1
and B if she saw 0. Again, trader 1 would not want to move
again.
Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if
traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of 
strategies is not an equilibrium. The exact position of the points
does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the
observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the
setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each
other. Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0. He could move to
X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a
1. Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could
correct the rating to A. To show that this is a profitable
deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to 
playing two additional moves over trader 1"s myopic strategy of
moving to Y . The first move, Y X may either move toward
or away from the optimal final position. The second move,
DA or BC, is always in the correct direction. Further, 
because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY ,
their projection on the final p-line will always be greater
324
in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of
what the true p-line is! Thus, the deception would result in
a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1. Note that this
problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our
equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or
DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and 
different numerical values). Observe also that a strategy profile
in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and
trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect
equilibrium in this setup.
We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem
might be by reducing the radius at every move. This 
essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1
to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2. 
Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments
AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a
smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal.
