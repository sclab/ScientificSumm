In this section, we describe an abstract betting game, the
projection game; in the following sections, we will argue
that both the MSR and the DPM are strategically similar
to the projection game. The projection game is conceptually
simpler than MSR and DPM, and hence should prove easier
to analyze. For clarity of exposition, here and in the rest of
the paper we assume the space is two dimensional, i.e., there
are only two possible events. Our results easily generalize
to more than two dimensions. We also assume throughout
that players are risk-neutral.
Suppose there are two mutually exclusive and exhaustive
events, A and B. (In other words, B is the same as not
A.) There are n agents who may have information about
the likelihood of A and B, and we (the designers) would like
to aggregate their information. We invite them to play the
game described below:
At any point in the game, there is a current state 
described by a pair of parameters, (x, y), which we sometimes
write in vector form as x. Intuitively, x corresponds to the

information market for later gain from the market itself; we do not
consider the possibility of traders having vested interests in
the underlying events.

total holding of shares in A, and y corresponds to the 
holding of shares in B. In each move of the game, one player
(say i) plays an arrow (or segment) from (x, y) to (x , y ).
We use the notation [(x, y) → (x , y )] or [x, x ] to 
denote this move. The game starts at (0, 0), but the market
maker makes the first move; without loss of generality, we
can assume the move is to (1, 1). All subsequent moves are
made by players, in an arbitrary (and potentially repeating)
sequence.
Each move has a cost associated with it, given by
C[x, x ] = |x | − |x|,
where | · | denotes the Euclidean norm, |x| =
p
x2 + y2.
Note that none of the variables are constrained to be 
nonnegative, and hence, the cost of a move can be negative.
The cost can be expressed in an alternative form, that is
also useful. Suppose player i moves from (x, y) to (x , y ).
We can write (x , y ) as (x + lex, y + ley), such that l ≥ 0
and |ex|2
+ |ey|2
= 1. We call l the volume of the move, and
(ex, ey) the direction of the move. At any point (ˆx, ˆy), there
is an instantaneous price charged, defined as follows:
c((ˆx, ˆy), (ex, ey)) =
ˆxex + ˆyey
|(ˆx, ˆy)|
=
ˆx · e
|ˆx|
.
Note that the price depends only on the angle between the
line joining the vector (ˆx, ˆy) and the segment [(x, y), (x , y )],
and not the lengths. The total cost of the move is the price
integrated over the segment [(x, y) → (x , y )], i.e.,
C[(x, y) → (x , y )] =
Z l
w=0
c((x+wex, y +wey), (ex, ey))dw
We assume that the game terminates after a finite number
of moves. At the end of the game, the true probability p of
event A is determined, and the agents receive payoffs for the
moves they made. Let q = (qx, qy) = (p,1−p)
|(p,1−p)|
. The payoff
to agent i for a segment [(x, y) → (x , y )] is given by:
P([(x, y) → (x , y )]) = qx(x − x) + qy(y − y) = q.(x − x)
We call the line through the origin with slope (1 − p)/p =
qy/qx the p-line. Note that the payoff, too, may be negative.
One drawback of the definition of a projection game is
that implementing the payoffs requires us to know the 
actual probability p. This is feasible if the probability can
eventually be determined statistically, such as when 
predicting the relative frequency of different recurring events,
or vote shares. It is also feasible for one-off events in which
there is reason to believe that the true probability is either
0 or 1. For other one-off events, it cannot be implemented
directly (unlike scoring rules, which can be implemented in
expectation). However, we believe that even in these cases,
the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and 
analytical tool.
The moves, costs and payoffs have a natural geometric
representation, which is shown in Figure 1 for three 
players with one move each. The players append directed line
segments in turn, and the payoff player i finally receives for
a move is the projection of her segment onto the line with
slope (1 − p)/p. Her cost is the difference of distances of the
endpoints of her move to the origin.

Lemma 1. [Path-Independence] Suppose there is a sequence
of moves leading from (x, y) to (x , y ). Then, the total
cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move
[(x, y) → (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the moves is
equal to the payoff of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )].
Proof. The proof follows trivially from the definition of
the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to
point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the
net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by
x and x .
Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally
important, because it implies (and is implied by) the 
absence of arbitrage in the market. In other words, there is no
sequence of moves that start and end at the same point, but
result in a positive profit. On the other hand, if there were
two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there
would be a cyclic path with positive profit.
For ease of reference, we summarize some more useful
properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection
game.
Lemma 2.
1. The instantaneous price for moving along a line through
the origin is 1 or −1, when the move is away or toward
the origin respectively. The instantaneous price along
a circle centered at the origin is 0.
2. When x moves along a circle centered at the origin to
point ¯x on the positive p-line, the corresponding payoff
is P(x, ¯x) = |x| − x · q, and the cost is C[x, ¯x] = 0.
3. The two cost function formulations are equivalent:
C[x, x ] =
Z l
w=0
cos(x + we, e)dw = |x |−|x| ∀x, x ,
where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move.
In addition, when x moves along the positive p-line,
the payoff is equal to the cost, P(x, x ) = |x | − |x|.
Proof. 1. The instantaneous price is
c(x, e) = x · e/|x| = cos(x, e),
where e is the direction of movement, and the result
follows.
2. Since ¯x is on the positive p-line, q·¯x = |¯x| = |x|, hence
P(x, ¯x) = q · (¯x − x) = |x| − x · q; the cost is 0 from
the definition.

3. From Part 1, the cost of moving from x to the origin
is
C[x, 0] =
Z l
w=0
cos(x + we, e)dw =
Z l
w=0
(−1)dw = −|x|,
where l = |x|, e = x/|x|. By the path-independence
property,
C[x, x ] = C[x, 0] + C[0, x ] = |x | − |x|.
Finally, a point on the positive p-line gets projected
to itself, namely q · x = |x| so when the movement
is along the positive p-line, P(x, x ) = q · (x − x) =
|x | − |x| = C[x, x ].
We now consider the question of which moves are 
profitable in this game. The eventual profit of a move [x, x ],
where x = x + l.(ex, ey), is
profit[x, x ] = P[x, x ] − C[x, x ]
= lq.e − C[x, x ]
Differentiating with respect to l, we get
d(profit)
dl
= q.e − c(x + le, e)
= q.e −
x + le
|x + le|
.e
We observe that this is 0 if p(y + ley) = (1 − p)(x + lex),
in other words, when the vectors q and (x + le) are exactly
aligned. Further, we observe that the price is non-decreasing
with increasing l. Thus, along the direction e, the profit is
maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line.
By Lemma 2, there is always a path from x to the positive
p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circle with
center at the origin and radius |x|. Also, any movement
along the p-line has 0 additional profit. Thus, for any point
x, we can define the profit potential φ(x, p) by
φ(x, p) = |x| − x · q.
Note, the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line
and zero for x on the line. Next we show that a move to a
lower potential is always profitable.
Lemma 3. The profit of a move [x, x ] is equal to the 
difference in potential φ(x, p) − φ(x , p).
Proof. Denote z = |x|q and z = |x |q, i.e., these are
the points of intersection of the positive p-line with the 
circles centered at the origin with radii |x| and |x | respectively.
By the path-independence property and Lemma 2, the profit
of move [x, x ] is
profit(x, x ) = profit(x, z) + profit(z, z ) + profit(z , x )
= (|x| − x · q) + 0 + (x · q − |x |)
= φ(x, p) − φ(x , p).
Thus, the profit of the move is equal to the change in profit
potential between the endpoints.
This lemma offers another way of seeing that it is optimal to
move to the point of lowest potential, namely to the p-line.
