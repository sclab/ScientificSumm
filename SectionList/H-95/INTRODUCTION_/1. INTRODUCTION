Search engine queries are often associated with geographical 
locations, either explicitly (i.e. a location reference is given as part of
the query) or implicitly (i.e. the location reference is not present in
the query string, but the query clearly has a local intent [17]). One
of the concerns of geographical information retrieval (GIR) lies in
appropriately handling such queries, bringing better targeted search
results and improving user satisfaction.
Nowadays, GIR is getting increasing attention. Systems that 
access resources on the basis of geographic context are starting to
appear, both in the academic and commercial domains [4, 7]. 
Accurately and effectively detecting location references in search 
engine queries is a crucial aspect of these systems, as they are 
generally based on interpreting geographical terms differently from the
others. Detecting locations in queries is also important for 
generalpropose search engines, as this information can be used to improve
ranking algorithms. Queries with a local intent are best answered
with localized pages, while queries without any geographical 
references are best answered with broad pages [5].
Text mining methods have been successfully used in GIR to 
detect and disambiguate geographical references in text [9], or even to
infer geographic scopes for documents [1, 13]. However, this body
of research has been focused on processing Web pages and full-text
documents. Search engine queries are more difficult to handle, in
the sense that they are very short and with implicit and subjective
user intents. Moreover, the data is also noisier and more versatile
in form, and we have to deal with misspellings, multilingualism
and acronyms. How to automatically understand what the user 
intended, given a search query, without putting the burden in the user
himself, remains an open text mining problem.
Key challenges in handling locations over search engine queries
include their detection and disambiguation, the ranking of possible
candidates, the detection of false positives (i.e not all contained 
location names refer to geographical locations), and the detection of
implied locations by the context of the query (i.e. when the query
does not explicitly contain a place reference but it is nonetheless 
geographical). Simple named entity recognition (NER) algorithms,
based on dictionary look-ups for geographical names, may 
introduce high false positives for queries whose location names do not
constitute place references. For example the query Denzel 
Washington contains the place name Washington, but the query is not
geographical. Queries can also be geographic without containing
any explicit reference to locations at the dictionary. In these cases,
place name extraction and disambiguation does not give any results,
and we need to access other sources of information.
This paper proposes simple and yet effective techniques for 
handling place references over queries. Each query is split into a triple
< what,relation,where >, where what specifies the non-geographic
aspect of the information need, where specifies the geographic 
areas of interest, and relation specifies a spatial relationship 
connecting what and where. When this is not possible, i.e. the query does
not contain any place references, we try using information from
documents matching the query, exploiting geographic scopes 
previously assigned to these documents.
Disambiguating place references is one of the most important
aspects. We use a search procedure that combines textual patterns
with geographical names defined at an ontology, and we use 
heuristics to disambiguate the discovered references (e.g. more important
places are preferred). Disambiguation results in having the where
term, from the triple above, associated with the most likely 
corresponding concepts from the ontology. When we cannot detect
any locations, we attempt to use geographical scopes previously
inferred for the documents at the top search results. By doing this,
we assume that the most frequent geographical scope in the results
should correspond to the geographical context implicit in the query.
Experiments with CLEF topics [4] and sample queries from a
Web search engine show that the proposed methods are accurate,
and may have applications in improving search results.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first formalize
the problem and describe related work to our research. Next, we
describe our approach for handling place names in queries, starting
with the general approach for disambiguating place references over
textual strings, then presenting the method for splitting a query into
a < what,relation,where > triple, and finally discussing the 
technique for exploiting geographic scopes previously assigned to 
documents in the result set. Section 4 presents evaluation results. 
Finally, we give some conclusions and directions for future research.
