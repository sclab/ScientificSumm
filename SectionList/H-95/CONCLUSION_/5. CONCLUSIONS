This paper presented simple approaches for handling place 
references in search engine queries. This is a hard text mining problem,
as queries are often ambiguous or underspecify information needs.
However, our initial experiments indicate that for many queries, the
referenced places can be determined effectively. Unlike the 
techniques proposed by Wang et. al. [17], we mainly focused on 
recognizing spatial relations and associating place names to ontology
concepts. The proposed techniques were employed in the prototype
system that we used for participating in GeoCLEF 2006. In queries
where a geographical reference is not explicitly mentioned, we 
propose to use the results for the query, exploiting geographic scopes
previously assigned to these documents. In the future, we plan on
doing a careful evaluation of this last approach. Another idea that
we would like to test involves the integration of a spelling 
correction mechanism [12] into Algorithm 1, so that incorrectly spelled
place references can be matched to ontology concepts.
The proposed techniques for handling geographic queries can
have many applications in improving GIR systems or even general
purpose search engines. After place references are appropriately
disambiguated into ontology concepts, a GIR system can use them
to retrieve relevant results, through the use of appropriate index
structures (e.g. indexing the spatial coordinates associated with 
ontology concepts) and provided that the documents are also assigned
to scopes corresponding to ontology concepts. A different GIR
strategy can involve query expansion, by taking the where terms
from the query and using the ontology to add names from 
neighboring locations. In a general purpose search engine, and if a local
query is detected, we can forward users to a GIR system, which
should be better suited for properly handling the query. The regular
Google search interface already does this, by presenting a link to
Google Local when it detects a geographical query.
