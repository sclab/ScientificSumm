CONFLEX [1] is an efficient conformational space search
program, which can predominately and exhaustively search
the conformers in the lower-energy region. Applications of
CONFLEX include the elucidation of the reactivity and 
selectivity of drugs and possible drug materials with regard to
their conformational flexibility.
2.1 Algorithm of ConformationalSpaceSearch
The basic strategy of CONFLEX is an exhaustive search
of only the low-energy regions. The original CONFLEX
performs the following four major steps:
1. Selection of an initial structure among the previously
discovered unique conformers sorted in a 
conformational database. (An input structure is used as the
first initial structure at the beginning of a search 
execution only.)
2. Generation of trial structures by local perturbations
to the selected initial structure.
3. Geometry optimization for the newly generated trial
structures.
4. Comparison of the successfully optimized (trial) 
structures with the other conformers stored in a 
conformation database, and preservation of newly discovered
unique conformers in the database.
Figure 1 shows the outline of CONFLEX, the original 
conformational space search algorithm.
These procedures incorporate two unique strategies. 
Figure 2 shows the strategies for generating local perturbations
in CONFLEX. The first strategy involves both corner 
flapping and edge flipping for the ring atoms and stepwise 
rotation for side-chains or backbone chains. These methods
provide a highly efficient way to produce several good trial
structures. These perturbations can be considered to mimic

a barrier-crossing step in the elementary process of the 
thermal conformational inter-conversion. Actually, the 
perturbations of an initial structure correspond to the precise 
performance around the space of the initial structure because
of localization and weakness of the perturbation.
The selection rule of the initial structure, the 
LowestConformer-First rule, is the second strategy for directing
the conformation search expanded to the low-energy regions.
The initial structure is selected as the set of lowest energy
conformers stored in the conformation database. This rule
is effective in moving down the search space toward lower
energy regions, like water from a stream running into an
empty reservoir, while filling local depressions along the
way. Therefore, these tactical procedures of the CONFLEX
search are referred to as the Reservoir Filling Algorithm.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform
an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which 
determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is
pre-defined. Gradually increasing SEL allows only the 
lowenergy conformers to be searched and avoids straying into
unnecessarily high-energy regions.
2.2 Parallelization of CONFLEX for Cluster
For application to over 100 atoms, CONFLEX was 
improved using high-performance parallel computing techniques.
In the CONFLEX search algorithm, the geometry 
optimization procedures always take 95% of the elapsed time of the
search execution. Therefore, we parallelized this 
optimization using the Master/Worker parallelization technique.
We modified the search procedures as follows. After trial
structures are generated (step 2), they are temporarily stored
in a task pool on the master node. Then, each worker node
is dynamically supplied with one trial structure from the
master node. After an optimization on a worker node is
finished, the worker is immediately supplied with another
trial structure. When all of the trial structures related to a
given initial structure are optimized, only the master 
procedure is used in comparison. By parallelizing CONFLEX,
the speedup of searching molecular conformers obtained is
as reported in[11].
