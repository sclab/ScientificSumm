We work with a slightly restricted class of games, as 
compared to the full generality of the extensive form. This class,
which we call games with ordered signals, is highly 
structured, but still general enough to capture a wide range of
strategic situations. A game with ordered signals consists
of a finite number of rounds. Within a round, the players
play a game on a directed tree (the tree can be different in
different rounds). The only uncertainty players face stems
from private signals the other players have received and from
the unknown future signals. In other words, players observe
each others" actions, but potentially not nature"s actions.
In each round, there can be public signals (announced to all
players) and private signals (confidentially communicated
to individual players). For simplicity, we assume-as is the
case in most recreational games-that within each round,
the number of private signals received is the same across
players (this could quite likely be relaxed). We also assume
that the legal actions that a player has are independent of
the signals received. For example, in poker, the legal 
betting actions are independent of the cards received. Finally,
the strongest assumption is that there is a partial ordering
over sets of signals, and the payoffs are increasing (not 
necessarily strictly) in these signals. For example, in poker, this
partial ordering corresponds exactly to the ranking of card
hands.
Definition 1. A game with ordered signals is a tuple
Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u where:
1. I = {1, . . . , n} is a finite set of players.
2. G = G1
, . . . , Gr
, Gj
=
`
V j
, Ej
´
, is a finite collection
of finite directed trees with nodes V j
and edges Ej
. Let
Zj
denote the leaf nodes of Gj
and let Nj
(v) denote
the outgoing neighbors of v ∈ V j
. Gj
is the stage game
for round j.
3. L = L1
, . . . , Lr
, Lj
: V j
\ Zj
→ I indicates which
player acts (chooses an outgoing edge) at each internal
node in round j.
4. Θ is a finite set of signals.
5. κ = κ1
, . . . , κr
and γ = γ1
, . . . , γr
are vectors of
nonnegative integers, where κj
and γj
denote the 
number of public and private signals (per player), 
respectively, revealed in round j. Each signal θ ∈ Θ may
only be revealed once, and in each round every player
receives the same number of private signals, so we 
require
Pr
j=1 κj
+ nγj
≤ |Θ|. The public information
revealed in round j is αj
∈ Θκj
and the public 
information revealed in all rounds up through round j
is ˜αj
=
`
α1
, . . . , αj
´
. The private information 
revealed to player i ∈ I in round j is βj
i ∈ Θγj
and
the private information revaled to player i ∈ I in all
rounds up through round j is ˜βj
i =
`
β1
i , . . . , βj
i
´
. We
162
also write ˜βj
=

˜βj
1, . . . , ˜βj
n

to represent all private
information up through round j, and

˜β
j
i , ˜βj
−i

=

˜βj
1, . . . , ˜βj
i−1, ˜β
j
i , ˜βj
i+1, . . . , ˜βj
n

is ˜βj
with ˜βj
i replaced
with ˜β
j
i . The total information revealed up through
round j,

˜αj
, ˜βj

, is said to be legal if no signals are
repeated.
6. p is a probability distribution over Θ, with p(θ) > 0
for all θ ∈ Θ. Signals are drawn from Θ according
to p without replacement, so if X is the set of signals
already revealed, then
p(x | X) =
(
p(x)P
y /∈X p(y)
if x /∈ X
0 if x ∈ X.
7. is a partial ordering of subsets of Θ and is defined
for at least those pairs required by u.
8. ω :
rS
j=1
Zj
→ {over, continue} is a mapping of 
terminal nodes within a stage game to one of two 
values: over, in which case the game ends, or continue,
in which case the game continues to the next round.
Clearly, we require ω(z) = over for all z ∈ Zr
. Note
that ω is independent of the signals. Let ωj
over = {z ∈
Zj
| ω(z) = over} and ωj
cont = {z ∈ Zj
| ω(z) =
continue}.
9. u = (u1
, . . . , ur
), uj
:

cont × ωj

every j, 1 ≤ j ≤ r, for every i ∈ I, and for every

over, at least one of the following two
conditions holds:
(a) Utility is signal independent: uj

i (˜z, ϑ )
for all legal ϑ, ϑ ∈
j
k=1

.
(b) is defined for all legal signals (˜αj
, ˜βj
i ), (˜αj
, ˜β j
i )
through round j and a player"s utility is increasing
in her private signals, everything else equal:

˜αj

˜αj

We will use the term game with ordered signals and the
term ordered game interchangeably.
2.1 Information filters
In this subsection, we define an information filter for 
ordered games. Instead of completely revealing a signal (either
public or private) to a player, the signal first passes through
this filter, which outputs a coarsened signal to the player. By
varying the filter applied to a game, we are able to obtain
a wide variety of games while keeping the underlying action
space of the game intact. We will use this when designing
our abstraction techniques. Formally, an information filter
is as follows.
Definition 2. Let Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u be an
ordered game. Let Sj
⊆
j
k=1
Θκk
×
j
k=1
Θγk
be the set of
legal signals (i.e., no repeated signals) for one player through
round j. An information filter for Γ is a collection F =
F1
, . . . , Fr
where each Fj
is a function Fj
: Sj
→ 2Sj
such that each of the following conditions hold:
1. (Truthfulness) (˜αj
, ˜βj
i ) ∈ Fj
(˜αj
, ˜βj
i ) for all legal (˜αj
, ˜βj
i ).
2. (Independence) The range of Fj
is a partition of Sj
.
3. (Information preservation) If two values of a signal are
distinguishable in round k, then they are 
distinguishable fpr each round j > k. Let mj
=
Pj
l=1 κl
+γl
. We
require that for all legal (θ1, . . . , θmk , . . . , θmj ) ⊆ Θ and
(θ1, . . . , θmk , . . . , θmj ) ⊆ Θ:
(θ1, . . . , θmk ) /∈ Fk
(θ1, . . . , θmk ) =⇒
(θ1, . . . , θmk , . . . , θmj ) /∈ Fj
(θ1, . . . , θmk , . . . , θmj ).
A game with ordered signals Γ and an information filter
F for Γ defines a new game ΓF . We refer to such games as
filtered ordered games. We are left with the original game
if we use the identity filter Fj

˜αj
, ˜βj
i

=
n
˜αj
, ˜βj

o
. We
have the following simple (but important) result:
Proposition 1. A filtered ordered game is an extensive
form game satisfying perfect recall.
A simple proof proceeds by constructing an extensive form
game directly from the ordered game, and showing that it
satisfies perfect recall. In determining the payoffs in a game
with filtered signals, we take the average over all real signals
in the filtered class, weighted by the probability of each real
signal occurring.
2.2 Strategies and Nash equilibrium
We are now ready to define behavior strategies in the 
context of filtered ordered games.
Definition 3. A behavior strategy for player i in round
j of Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u with information filter
F is a probability distribution over possible actions, and is
defined for each player i, each round j, and each v ∈ V j
\Zj
for Lj
(v) = i:
σj
i,v :
j−1
k=1
ωk
cont×Range

Fj

→ Δ
n
w ∈ V j
| (v, w) ∈ Ej
o
.
(Δ(X) is the set of probability distributions over a finite set
X.) A behavior strategy for player i in round j is σj
i =
(σj
i,v1
, . . . , σj
i,vm
) for each vk ∈ V j
\ Zj
where Lj
(vk) = i.
A behavior strategy for player i in Γ is σi =
`
σ1
i , . . . , σr
i
´
.
A strategy profile is σ = (σ1, . . . , σn). A strategy profile with
σi replaced by σi is (σi, σ−i) = (σ1, . . . , σi−1, σi, σi+1, . . . , σn).
By an abuse of notation, we will say player i receives an
expected payoff of ui(σ) when all players are playing the
strategy profile σ. Strategy σi is said to be player i"s best
response to σ−i if for all other strategies σi for player i we
have ui(σi, σ−i) ≥ ui(σi, σ−i). σ is a Nash equilibrium if,
for every player i, σi is a best response for σ−i. A Nash
equilibrium always exists in finite extensive form games [36],
and one exists in behavior strategies for games with perfect
recall [29]. Using these observations, we have the following
corollary to Proposition 1:
163
Corollary 1. For any filtered ordered game, a Nash 
equilibrium exists in behavior strateges.
