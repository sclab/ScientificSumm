ABSTRACTIONS
In this section, we present our main technique for reducing
the size of games. We begin by defining a filtered signal tree
which represents all of the chance moves in the game. The
bold edges (i.e. the first two levels of the tree) in the game
trees in Figure 1 correspond to the filtered signal trees in
each game.
Definition 4. Associated with every ordered game Γ =
I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u and information filter F is a 
filtered signal tree, a directed tree in which each node 
corresponds to some revealed (filtered) signals and edges 
correspond to revealing specific (filtered) signals. The nodes in the
filtered signal tree represent the set of all possible revealed 
filtered signals (public and private) at some point in time. The
filtered public signals revealed in round j correspond to the
nodes in the κj
levels beginning at level
Pj−1
k=1

and the private signals revealed in round j correspond to
the nodes in the nγj
levels beginning at level

Pj−1
k=1 nγk
. We denote children of a node x as N(x). In
addition, we associate weights with the edges corresponding
to the probability of the particular edge being chosen given
that its parent was reached.
In many games, there are certain situations in the game
that can be thought of as being strategically equivalent to
other situations in the game. By melding these situations
together, it is possible to arrive at a strategically 
equivalent smaller game. The next two definitions formalize this
notion via the introduction of the ordered game isomorphic
relation and the ordered game isomorphic abstraction 
transformation.
Definition 5. Two subtrees beginning at internal nodes
x and y of a filtered signal tree are ordered game 
isomorphic if x and y have the same parent and there is a 
bijection f : N(x) → N(y), such that for w ∈ N(x) and
v ∈ N(y), v = f(w) implies the weights on the edges (x, w)
and (y, v) are the same and the subtrees beginning at w and
v are ordered game isomorphic. Two leaves 
(corresponding to filtered signals ϑ and ϑ up through round r) are
ordered game isomorphic if for all ˜z ∈
r−1

ur
(˜z, ϑ) = ur
(˜z, ϑ ).
Definition 6. Let Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u be an
ordered game and let F be an information filter for Γ. Let
ϑ and ϑ be two nodes where the subtrees in the induced
filtered signal tree corresponding to the nodes ϑ and ϑ are
ordered game isomorphic, and ϑ and ϑ are at either levelPj−1

Figure 1 shows the ordered game isomorphic abstraction
transformation applied twice to a tiny poker game. 
Theorem 2, our main equilibrium result, shows how the ordered
game isomorphic abstraction transformation can be used to
compute equilibria faster.
Theorem 2. Let Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u be an
ordered game and F be an information filter for Γ. Let F be
an information filter constructed from F by one application
of the ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation.

, σ is
a Nash equilibrium of ΓF .
Proof. For an extensive form game, a belief system μ
assigns a probability to every decision node x such thatP
x∈h μ(x) = 1 for every information set h. A strategy
profile σ is sequentially rational at h given belief system μ if
ui(σi, σ−i | h, μ) ≥ ui(τi, σ−i | h, μ)
for all other strategies τi, where i is the player who controls
h. A basic result [33, Proposition 9.C.1] characterizing Nash
equilibria dictates that σ is a Nash equilibrium if and only
if there is a belief system μ such that for every information
set h with Pr(h | σ) > 0, the following two conditions hold:
(C1) σ is sequentially rational at h given μ; and (C2) μ(x) =
Pr(x | σ)
Pr(h | σ)
for all x ∈ h. Since σ is a Nash equilibrium of Γ ,
there exists such a belief system μ for ΓF . Using μ , we will
construct a belief system μ for Γ and show that conditions
C1 and C2 hold, thus supporting σ as a Nash equilibrium.
Fix some player i ∈ I. Each of i"s information sets in some
round j corresponds to filtered signals Fj

, ˜β∗j

in the first j − 1 rounds (z1, . . . , zj−1) ∈
j−1
k=1
ωk
cont, and 
history so far in round j, v ∈ V j
\ Zj
. Let ˜z = (z1, . . . , zj−1, v)
represent all of the player actions leading to this 
information set. Thus, we can uniquely specify this information set
using the information

Fj

˜α∗j
, ˜β∗j
i

, ˜z

.
Each node in an information set corresponds to the 
possible private signals the other players have received. Denote
by ˜β some legal
(Fj
(˜αj
, ˜βj
1), . . . , Fj
(˜αj
, ˜βj
i−1), Fj
(˜αj
, ˜βj
i+1), . . . , Fj
(˜αj
, ˜βj
n)).
In other words, there exists (˜αj
, ˜βj
1, . . . , ˜βj
n) such that
(˜αj
, ˜βj
i ) ∈ Fj
(˜α∗j
, ˜β∗j
i ), (˜αj
, ˜βj
k) ∈ Fj
(˜αj
, ˜βj
k)
for k = i, and no signals are repeated. Using such a set
of signals (˜αj
, ˜βj
1, . . . , ˜βj
n), let ˆβ denote (F j
(˜αj
, ˜βj
1), . . . ,
F j
(˜αj
, ˜βj
i−1), F j
(˜αj
, ˜βj
i+1), . . . , F j
(˜αj
, ˜βj
n). (We will abuse
notation and write F j
−i

ˆβ

= ˆβ .) We can now compute μ
directly from μ :

Figure 1: GameShrink applied to a tiny two-person four-card (two Jacks and two Kings) poker game. Next
to each game tree is the range of the information filter F. Dotted lines denote information sets, which are
labeled by the controlling player. Open circles are chance nodes with the indicated transition probabilities.
The root node is the chance node for player 1"s card, and the next level is for player 2"s card. The payment
from player 2 to player 1 is given below each leaf. In this example, the algorithm reduces the game tree from
53 nodes to 19 nodes.

. The following three claims
show that μ as calculated above supports σ as a Nash 
equilibrium.
Claim 1. μ is a valid belief system for ΓF .
Claim 2. For all information sets h with Pr(h | σ) > 0,
μ(x) = Pr(x | σ)
Pr(h | σ)
for all x ∈ h.
Claim 3. For all information sets h with Pr(h | σ) > 0,
σ is sequentially rational at h given μ.
The proofs of Claims 1-3 are in an extended version of this
paper [13]. By Claims 1 and 2, we know that condition C2
holds. By Claim 3, we know that condition C1 holds. Thus,
σ is a Nash equilibrium.
3.1 Nontriviality of generalizing beyond this
model
Our model does not capture general sequential games of
imperfect information because it is restricted in two ways
(as discussed above): 1) there is a special structure 
connecting the player actions and the chance actions (for one,
the players are assumed to observe each others" actions, but
nature"s actions might not be publicly observable), and 2)
there is a common ordering of signals. In this subsection we
show that removing either of these conditions can make our
technique invalid.
First, we demonstrate a failure when removing the first
assumption. Consider the game in Figure 2.6
Nodes a and
b are in the same information set, have the same parent
(chance) node, have isomorphic subtrees with the same 
payoffs, and nodes c and d also have similar structural 
properties. By merging the subtrees beginning at a and b, we get
the game on the right in Figure 2. In this game, player
1"s only Nash equilibrium strategy is to play left. But in
the original game, player 1 knows that node c will never be
reached, and so should play right in that information set.

developing a theory of equilibrium-preserving abstractions
for general extensive form games.
Removing the second assumption (that the utility 
functions are based on a common ordering of signals) can also
cause failure. Consider a simple three-card game with a
deck containing two Jacks (J1 and J2) and a King (K),
where player 1"s utility function is based on the ordering

K J1 ∼ J2 but player 2"s utility function is based on the
ordering J2 K J1. It is easy to check that in the 
abstracted game (where Player 1 treats J1 and J2 as being
equivalent) the Nash equilibrium does not correspond to
a Nash equilibrium in the original game.7
