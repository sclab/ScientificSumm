DOCUMENT SPACE
Consider the dual definitions of retrieval parameters in
table 1. We associate a collection space D × T with a 
collection c where D is the set of documents and T is the set
of terms in the collection. Let ND := |D| and NT := |T|
be the number of documents and terms, respectively. We
consider a document as a subset of T and a term as a subset
of D. Let nT (d) := |{t|d ∈ t}| be the number of terms that
occur in the document d, and let nD(t) := |{d|t ∈ d}| be the
number of documents that contain the term t.
In a dual way, we associate a document space L × T with
a document d where L is the set of locations (also referred
to as positions, however, we use the letters L and l and not
P and p for avoiding confusion with probabilities) and T is
the set of terms in the document. The document dimension
in a collection space corresponds to the location (position)
dimension in a document space.
The definition makes explicit that the classical notion of
term frequency of a term in a document (also referred to as
the within-document term frequency) actually corresponds
to the location frequency of a term in a document. For the

nD(t, c): Number of documents in which term t
occurs in collection c
nL(t, d): Number of locations (positions) at which
term t occurs in document d
ND(c): Number of documents in collection c NL(d): Number of locations (positions) in 
document d
term frequency nT (d, c): Number of terms that document d 
contains in collection c
nT (l, d): Number of terms that location l contains
in document d

conciseness − ln P(d|c) − ln P(l|d)
P(informative) ln(P(t|c))/ ln(P(tmin, c)) ln(P(t|d))/ ln(P(tmin, d))
P(concise) ln(P(d|c))/ ln(P(dmin|c)) ln(P(l|d))/ ln(P(lmin|d))

maximal occurrence (number of locations; let lf be the location
frequency).

A further duality is between informativeness and 
conciseness (shortness of documents or locations): informativeness
is based on occurrence (noise), conciseness is based on 
containment.
We have highlighted in this section the duality between
the collection space and the document space. We 
concentrate in this paper on the probability of a term to be noisy
and informative. Those probabilities are defined in the 
collection space. However, the results regarding the term noise
and informativeness apply to their dual counterparts: term
occurrence and informativeness in a document. Also, the
results can be applied to containment of documents and 
locations.
