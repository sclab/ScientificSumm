A naive extension of influence diagrams (IDs) to settings 
populated by multiple agents is possible by treating other agents as 
automatons, represented using chance nodes. However, this approach
assumes that the agents" actions are controlled using a probability
distribution that does not change over time. Interactive influence
diagrams (I-IDs) adopt a more sophisticated approach by 
generalizing IDs to make them applicable to settings shared with other
agents who may act and observe, and update their beliefs.
3.1 Syntax
In addition to the usual chance, decision, and utility nodes, 
IIDs include a new type of node called the model node. We show a
general level l I-ID in Fig. 1(a), where the model node (Mj,l−1) is
denoted using a hexagon. We note that the probability distribution
over the chance node, S, and the model node together represents
agent i"s belief over its interactive states. In addition to the model

The 0th
level model is a POMDP: Other agent"s actions are treated
as exogenous events and folded into the T, O, and R functions.

(b). Members of the model node are I-IDs themselves (m1
j,l−1, m2
j,l−1; diagrams not shown here for simplicity) whose decision nodes are mapped to
the corresponding chance nodes (A1

j ). Depending on the value of the node, Mod[Mj], the distribution of each of the chance nodes is assigned to

node, I-IDs differ from IDs by having a dashed link (called the
policy link in [15]) between the model node and a chance node,
Aj, that represents the distribution over the other agent"s actions
given its model. In the absence of other agents, the model node and
the chance node, Aj, vanish and I-IDs collapse into traditional IDs.
The model node contains the alternative computational models
ascribed by i to the other agent from the set, Θj,l−1 ∪ SMj, where
Θj,l−1 and SMj were defined previously in Section 2. Thus, a
model in the model node may itself be an I-ID or ID, and the 
recursion terminates when a model is an ID or subintentional. Because
the model node contains the alternative models of the other agent
as its values, its representation is not trivial. In particular, some of
the models within the node are I-IDs that when solved generate the
agent"s optimal policy in their decision nodes. Each decision node
is mapped to the corresponding chance node, say A1
j , in the 
following way: if OPT is the set of optimal actions obtained by solving
the I-ID (or ID), then Pr(aj ∈ A1
j ) = 1
|OP T |
if aj ∈ OPT, 0
otherwise.
Borrowing insights from previous work [8], we observe that the
model node and the dashed policy link that connects it to the
chance node, Aj, could be represented as shown in Fig. 1(b). The
decision node of each level l − 1 I-ID is transformed into a chance
node, as we mentioned previously, so that the actions with the
largest value in the decision node are assigned uniform 
probabilities in the chance node while the rest are assigned zero probability.
The different chance nodes (A1
j , A2
j ), one for each model, and 
additionally, the chance node labeled Mod[Mj] form the parents of the
chance node, Aj. Thus, there are as many action nodes (A1
j , A2
j )
in Mj,l−1 as the number of models in the support of agent i"s 
beliefs. The conditional probability table of the chance node, Aj,
is a multiplexer that assumes the distribution of each of the action
nodes (A1
j , A2
j ) depending on the value of Mod[Mj]. The values of
Mod[Mj] denote the different models of j. In other words, when
Mod[Mj] has the value m1
j,l−1, the chance node Aj assumes the
distribution of the node A1
j , and Aj assumes the distribution of A2
j
when Mod[Mj] has the value m2
j,l−1. The distribution over the
node, Mod[Mj], is the agent i"s belief over the models of j given a
physical state. For more agents, we will have as many model nodes
as there are agents. Notice that Fig. 1(b) clarifies the semantics of
the policy link, and shows how it can be represented using the
traditional dependency links.
In Fig. 1(c), we show the transformed I-ID when the model node
is replaced by the chance nodes and relationships between them. In
contrast to the representation in [15], there are no special-purpose
policy links, rather the I-ID is composed of only those types of
nodes that are found in traditional IDs and dependency 
relationships between the nodes. This allows I-IDs to be represented and
implemented using conventional application tools that target IDs.
Note that we may view the level l I-ID as a NID. Specifically, each
of the level l − 1 models within the model node are blocks in the
NID (see Fig. 2). If the level l = 1, each block is a traditional ID,
otherwise if l > 1, each block within the NID may itself be a NID.
Note that within the I-IDs (or IDs) at each level, there is only a
single decision node. Thus, our NID does not contain any MAIDs.
Figure 2: A level l I-ID represented as a NID. The probabilities 
assigned to the blocks of the NID are i"s beliefs over j"s models 
conditioned on a physical state.
3.2 Solution
The solution of an I-ID proceeds in a bottom-up manner, and is
implemented recursively. We start by solving the level 0 models,
which, if intentional, are traditional IDs. Their solutions provide
probability distributions over the other agents" actions, which are
entered in the corresponding chance nodes found in the model node
of the level 1 I-ID. The mapping from the level 0 models" decision
nodes to the chance nodes is carried out so that actions with the
largest value in the decision node are assigned uniform 
probabilities in the chance node while the rest are assigned zero probability.
Given the distributions over the actions within the different chance
nodes (one for each model of the other agent), the level 1 I-ID is
transformed as shown in Fig. 1(c). During the transformation, the
conditional probability table (CPT) of the node, Aj, is populated
such that the node assumes the distribution of each of the chance
nodes depending on the value of the node, Mod[Mj]. As we 
mentioned previously, the values of the node Mod[Mj] denote the 
different models of the other agent, and its distribution is the agent i"s
belief over the models of j conditioned on the physical state. The
transformed level 1 I-ID is a traditional ID that may be solved

ing the standard expected utility maximization method [18]. This
procedure is carried out up to the level l I-ID whose solution gives
the non-empty set of optimal actions that the agent should perform
given its belief. Notice that analogous to IDs, I-IDs are suitable for
online decision-making when the agent"s current belief is known.
