The process of threading events together is related to threading
of electronic mail only by name for the most part. Email usually
incorporates a strong structure of referenced messages and 
consistently formatted subject headings-though information retrieval
techniques are useful when the structure breaks down [7]. Email
threading captures reference dependencies between messages and
does not attempt to reflect any underlying real-world structure of
the matter under discussion.
Another area of research that looks at the structure within a topic
is hierarchical text classification of topics [9, 6]. The hierarchy
within a topic does impose a structure on the topic, but we do not
know of an effort to explore the extent to which that structure 
reflects the underlying event relationships.
Barzilay and Lee [5] proposed a content structure modeling
technique where topics within text are learnt using unsupervised
methods, and a linear order of these topics is modeled using hidden
Markov models. Our work differs from theirs in that we do not 
constrain the dependency to be linear. Also their algorithms are tuned
to work on specific genres of topics such as earthquakes, accidents,
etc., while we expect our algorithms to generalize over any topic.
In TDT, researchers have traditionally considered topics as 
flatclusters [1]. However, in TDT-2003, a hierarchical structure of
topic detection has been proposed and [2] made useful attempts
to adopt the new structure. However this structure still did not 
explicitly model any dependencies between events.
In a work closest to ours, Makkonen [8] suggested modeling
news topics in terms of its evolving events. However, the paper
stopped short of proposing any models to the problem. Other 
related work that dealt with analysis within a news topic includes
temporal summarization of news topics [4].
