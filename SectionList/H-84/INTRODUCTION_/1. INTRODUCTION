News forms a major portion of information disseminated in the
world everyday. Common people and news analysts alike are very
interested in keeping abreast of new things that happen in the news,
but it is becoming very difficult to cope with the huge volumes
of information that arrives each day. Hence there is an increasing
need for automatic techniques to organize news stories in a way that
helps users interpret and analyze them quickly. This problem is 
addressed by a research program called Topic Detection and Tracking
(TDT) [3] that runs an open annual competition on standardized
tasks of news organization.
One of the shortcomings of current TDT evaluation is its view of
news topics as flat collection of stories. For example, the detection
task of TDT is to arrange a collection of news stories into clusters
of topics. However, a topic in news is more than a mere collection
of stories: it is characterized by a definite structure of inter-related
events. This is indeed recognized by TDT which defines a topic as
‘a set of news stories that are strongly related by some seminal 
realworld event" where an event is defined as ‘something that happens
at a specific time and location" [3]. For example, when a bomb
explodes in a building, that is the seminal event that triggers the
topic. Other events in the topic may include the rescue attempts,
the search for perpetrators, arrests and trials and so on. We see
that there is a pattern of dependencies between pairs of events in
the topic. In the above example, the event of rescue attempts is
‘influenced" by the event of bombing and so is the event of search
for perpetrators.
In this work we investigate methods for modeling the structure
of a topic in terms of its events. By structure, we mean not only
identifying the events that make up a topic, but also establishing
dependencies-generally causal-among them. We call the 
process of recognizing events and identifying dependencies among
them event threading, an analogy to email threading that shows
connections between related email messages. We refer to the 
resulting interconnected structure of events as the event model of the
topic. Although this paper focuses on threading events within an
existing news topic, we expect that such event based dependency
structure more accurately reflects the structure of news than strictly
bounded topics do. From a user"s perspective, we believe that our
view of a news topic as a set of interconnected events helps him/her
get a quick overview of the topic and also allows him/her navigate
through the topic faster.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we
discuss related work. In section 3, we define the problem and use
an example to illustrate threading of events within a news topic. In
section 4, we describe how we built the corpus for our problem.
Section 5 presents our evaluation techniques while section 6 
describes the techniques we use for modeling event structure. In 
section 7 we present our experiments and results. Section 8 concludes
the paper with a few observations on our results and comments on
future work.
