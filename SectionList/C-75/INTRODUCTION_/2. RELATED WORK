DIDMA [5] is a flexible, scalable, reliable, and 
platformindependent DIDS. DIDMA architecture allows distributed
analysis of events and can be easily extended by developing new
agents. However, the integration with existing IDSs and the
development of security components are presented as future work
[5]. The extensibility of DIDS DIDMA and the integration with
other IDSs are goals pursued by DIDSoG. The flexibility,
scalability, platform independence, reliability and security
components discussed in [5] are achieved in DIDSoG by using a
Grid platform.
More efficient techniques for analysis of great amounts of data in
wide scale networks based on clustering and applicable to DIDSs
are presented in [13]. The integration of heterogeneous IDSs to
increase the variety of intrusion detection techniques in the
environment is mentioned as future work [13] DIDSoG thus aims
at integrating heterogeneous IDSs [13].
Ref. [10] presents a hierarchical architecture for a DIDS;
information is collected, aggregated, correlated and analysed as it
is sent up in the hierarchy. The architecture comprises of several
components for: monitoring, correlation, intrusion detection by
statistics, detection by signatures and answers. Components in the
same level of the hierarchy cooperate with one another. The
integration proposed by DIDSoG also follows a hierarchical
architecture. Each IDS integrated to the DIDSoG offers
functionalities at a given level of the hierarchy and requests
functionalities from IDSs from another level. The hierarchy
presented in [10] integrates homogeneous IDSs whereas the
hierarchical architecture of DIDSoG integrates heterogeneous
IDSs.
There are proposals on integrating computational Grids and IDSs
[6],[7],[11],[2]. Ref. [6] and [7] propose the use of Globus
Toolkit for intrusion detection, especially for DoS (Denial of
Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks;
Globus is used due to the need to process great amounts of data to
detect these kinds of attack. A two-phase processing architecture
is presented. The first phase aims at the detection of momentary
attacks, while the second phase is concerned with chronic or
perennial attacks.
Traditional IDSs or DIDSs are generally coordinated by a central
point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks. Leu et al.
[6] point out that IDSs developed upon Grids platforms are less
vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such
platforms. Leu et al. [6],[7] have used tools to generate several
types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and
have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of
applying computational Grids to IDSs.
This work proposes the development of a DIDS upon a Grid
platform. However, the resulting DIDS integrates heterogeneous
IDSs whereas the DIDSs upon Grids presented by Leu et al.
[6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous IDSs. The
processing in phases [6][7] is also contemplated by DIDSoG,
which is enabled by the specification of several levels of
processing allowed by the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.
The DIDS GIDA (Grid Intrusion Detection Architecture) targets
at the detection of intrusions in a Grid environment [11]. GridSim
Grid simulator was used for the validation of DIDS GIDA.
Homogeneous resources were used to simplify the development
[11]. However, the possibility of applying heterogeneous
detection systems is left for future work
Another DIDS for Grids is presented by Choon and Samsudim
[2]. Scenarios demonstrating how a DIDS can execute on a Grid
environment are presented.
DIDSoG does not aim at detecting intrusions in a Grid
environment. In contrast, DIDSoG uses the Grid to compose a
DIDS by integrating specific IDSs; the resulting DIDS could
however be used to identify attacks in a Grid environment. Local
and distributed attacks can be detected through the integration of
traditional IDSs while attacks particular to Grids can be detected
through the integration of Grid IDSs.
