Solutions for integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection
Systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].
Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG
(Intrusion Detection Working Group) from the IETF (Internet
Engineering Task Force) [12] as follows:
• Many IDSs available in the market have strong and weak
points, which generally make necessary the deployment of
more than one IDS to provided an adequate solution.
• Attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple
networks spanning several administrative domains; these
domains usually utilize different IDSs. The integration of
IDSs is then needed to correlate information from multiple
networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and
or intrusions.
• The interoperability/integration of different IDS components
would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed
up the deployment of IDSs as commercial products.
DIDSs (Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems) therefore started
to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion
information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect
distributed attacks. Research on DIDSs has then received much
interest, mainly because centralised IDSs are not able to provide
the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].
However, the realization of a DIDS requires a high degree of
coordination. Computational Grids are appealing as they enable
the development of distributed application and coordination in a
distributed environment. Grid computing aims to enable
coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals
and/or organizations. Moreover, Grid middleware provides means
for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources;
resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for
transfer of data [4].
According to Foster et al. [4], Grids can be viewed as a set of
aggregate services defined by the resources that they share. OGSA
(Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this
service orientation in computational Grids. The services in OGSA
are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and 
platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of
interoperable applications.
This article proposes a model for integration of IDSs by using
computational Grids. The proposed model enables heterogeneous
IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed
DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid). Each
of the integrated IDSs is viewed by others as a resource accessed
through the services that it exposes. A Grid middleware provides
several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]:
decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols
and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of
Service).
The service oriented architecture followed by Grids (OGSA)
allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different
platforms. Different implementations can be encapsulated by a
service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to
resources in heterogeneous environments [3]. The virtualisation of
the environment through service interfaces allows the use of
services without the knowledge of how they are actually
implemented. This characteristic is important for the integration
of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different
IDSs.
Grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of
services. Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [3]: (i)
data management services, including access services, replication,
and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate
execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii)
auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or
intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the
discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate
alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification
of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the
correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.
These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.
A DIDS needs services for the location of and access to
distributed data from different IDSs. Auditing and monitoring
services take care of the proper needs of the DIDSs such as:
secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of
distributed sensors, and sending of alerts. The correlation of
distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of
distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert
information generated by the different IDSs that compose the
DIDSoG.
