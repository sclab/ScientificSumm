DIDSoG presents a hierarchy of intrusion detection services; this
hierarchy is organized through a two-dimensional vector defined
by Scope:Complexity. The IDSs composing DIDSoG can be
organized in different levels of scope or complexity, depending on
its functionalities, the topology of the target environment and
expected results.
Figure 1 presents a DIDSoG composed by different intrusion
detection services (i.e. data gathering, data aggregation, data
correlation, analysis, intrusion response and management)
provided by different IDSs. The information flow and the
relationship between the levels of scope and complexity are
presented in this figure.
Information about the environment (host, network or application)
is collected by Sensors located both in user 1"s and user 2"s
computers in domain 1. The information is sent to both simple
Analysers that act on the information from a single host (level
1:1), and to aggregation and correlation services that act on
information from multiple hosts from the same domain (level 2:1).
Simple Analysers in the first scope level send the information to
more complex Analysers in the next levels of complexity (level 1:
N). When an Analyser detects an intrusion, it communicates with
Countermeasure and Monitoring services registered to its scope.
An Analyser can invoke a Countermeasure service that replies to a
detected attack, or informs a Monitoring service about the
ongoing attack, so the administrator can act accordingly.
Aggregation and correlation resources in the second scope receive
information from Sensors from different users" computers (user
1"s and user 2"s) in the domain 1. These resources process the
received information and send it to the analysis resources
registered to the first level of complexity in the second scope
(level 2:1). The information is also sent to the aggregation and
correlation resources registered in the first level of complexity in
the next scope (level 3:1).

Fig. 1. How DIDSoG works.
The analysis resources in the second scope act like the analysis
resources in the first scope, directing the information to a more
complex analysis resource and putting the Countermeasure and
Monitoring resources in action in case of detected attacks.
Aggregation and correlation resources in the third scope receive
information from domains 1 and 2. These resources then carry out
the aggregation and correlation of the information from different
domains and send it to the analysis resources in the first level of
complexity in the third scope (level 3:1). The information could
also be sent to the aggregate service in the next scope in case of
any resources registered to such level.
The analysis resources in the third scope act similar to the analysis
resources in the first and second scopes, except that the analysis
resources in the third scope act on information from multiple
domains.
The functionalities of the registered resources in each of the
scopes and complexity level can vary from one environment to
another. The model allows the development of N levels of scope
and complexity.
Figure 2 presents the architecture of a resource participating in the
DIDSoG. Initially, the resource registers itself to GIS (Grid
Information Service) so other participating resources can query
the services provided. After registering itself, the resource
requests information about other intrusion detection resources
registered to the GIS.
A given resource of DIDSoG interacts with other resources, by
receiving data from the Source Resources, processing it, and
sending the results to the Destination Resources, therefore
forming a grid of intrusion detection resources.

Fig. 2. Architecture of a resource participating of the DIDSoG.
A resource is made up of four components: Base, Connector,
Descriptor and Native IDS. Native IDS corresponds to the IDS
being integrated to the DIDSoG. This component process the data
received from the Origin Resources and generates new data to be
sent to the Destination Resources. A Native IDS component can
be any tool processes information related to intrusion detection,
including analysis, data gathering, data aggregation, data
correlation, intrusion response or management.
The Descriptor is responsible for the information that identifies a
resource and its respective Destination Resources in the DIDSoG.
Figure 3 presents the class diagram of the stored information by
the Descriptor. The ResourceDescriptor class has Feature, Level,
DataType and Target Resources type members. Feature class
represents the functionalities that a resource has. Type, name and
version attributes refer to the functions offered by the Native IDS
component, its name and version, respectively. Level class
identifies the level of target and complexity in which the resource
acts. DataType class represents the data format that the resource
accepts to receive. DataType class is specialized by classes Text,
XML and Binary. Class XML contains the DTDFile attribute to
specify the DTD file that validates the received XML.

TargetResources class represents the features of the Destination
Resources of a determined resource. This class aggregates
Resource. The Resource class identifies the characteristics of a
Destination Resource. This identification is made through the
featureType attribute and the Level and DataType classes.
A given resource analyses the information from Descriptors from
other resources, and compares this information with the
information specified in TargetResources to know to which
resources to send the results of its processing.
The Base component is responsible for the communication of a
resource with other resources of the DIDSoG and with the Grid
Information Service. It is this component that registers the
resource and the queries other resources in the GIS.
The Connector component is the link between Base and Native
IDS. The information that Base receives from Origin Resources is
passed to Connector component. The Connector component
performs the necessary changes in the data so that it is understood
by Native IDS, and sends this data to Native IDS for processing.
The Connector component also has the responsibility of collecting
the information processed by Native IDS, and making the
necessary changes so the information can pass through the
DIDSoG again. After these changes, Connector sends the
information to the Base, which in turn sends it to the Destination
Resources in accordance with the specifications of the Descriptor
component.
