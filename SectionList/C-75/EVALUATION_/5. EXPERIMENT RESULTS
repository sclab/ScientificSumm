The hierarchic organization of scope and complexity provides a
high degree of flexibility to the model. The DIDSoG can be
modelled in accordance with the needs of each environment. The
descriptors define data flow desired for the resulting DIDS.
Each Native IDS is integrated to the DIDSoG through a
Connector component. The Connector component is also flexible
in the DIDSoG. Adaptations, conversions of data types and
auxiliary processes that Native IDSs need are provided by the
Connector. Filters and generation of Specific logs for each Native
IDS or environment can also be incorporated to the Connector.
If the integration of a new IDS to an environment already
configured is desired, it is enough to develop the Connector for
the desired IDS and to specify the resource Descriptor. After the
specification of the Connector and the Descriptor the new IDS is
integrated to the DIDSoG.
Through the definition of scopes, resources can act on data of
different source groups. For example, scope 1 can be related to a
given set of hosts, scope 2 to another set of hosts, while scope 3
can be related to hosts from scopes 1 and 2. Scopes can be defined
according to the needs of each environment.
The complexity levels allow the distribution of the processing
between several resources inside the same scope. In an analysis
task, for example, the search for simple attacks can be made by
resources of complexity 1, whereas the search for more complex
attacks, that demands more time, can be performed by resources
of complexity 2. With this, the analysis of the data is made by two
resources.
The distinction between complexity levels can also be organized
in order to integrate different techniques of intrusion detection.
The complexity level 1 could be defined for analyses based on
signatures, which are simpler techniques; the complexity level 2
for techniques based on behaviour, that require greater
computational power; and the complexity level 3 for intrusion
detection in applications, where the techniques are more specific
and depend on more data.
The division of scopes and the complexity levels make the
processing of the data to be carried out in phases. No resource has
full knowledge about the complete data processing flow. Each
resource only knows the results of its processing and the
destination to which it sends the results. Resources of higher
complexity must be linked to resources of lower complexity.
Therefore, the hierarchic structure of the DIDSoG is maintained,
facilitating its extension and integration with other domains of
intrusion detection.
By carrying out a hierarchic relationship between the several
chosen analysers for an environment, the sensor resource is not
overloaded with the task to send the data to all the analysers. An
initial analyser will exist (complexity level 1) to which the sensor
will send its data, and this analyser will then direct the data to the
next step of the processing flow. Another feature of the
hierarchical organization is the easy extension and integration
with other domains. If it is necessary to add a new host (sensor) to
the DIDSoG, it is enough to plug it to the first hierarchy of
resources. If it is necessary to add a new analyser, it will be in the
scope of several domains, it is enough to relate it to another
resource of same scope.
The DIDSoG allows different levels to be managed by different
entities. For example, the first scope can be managed by the local
user of a host. The second scope, comprising several hosts of a
domain can be managed by the administrator of the domain. A
third entity can be responsible for managing the security of
several domains in a joint way. This entity can act in the scope 3
independently from others.
With the proposed model for integration of IDSs in Grids, the
different IDSs of an environment (or multiple IDSs integrated) act
in a cooperative manner improving the intrusion detection
services, mainly in two aspects. First, the information from
multiple sources are analysed in an integrated way to search for
distributed attacks. This integration can be made under several
scopes. Second, there is a great diversity of data aggregation
techniques, data correlation and analysis, and intrusion response
that can be applied to the same environment; these techniques can
be organized under several levels of complexity.
