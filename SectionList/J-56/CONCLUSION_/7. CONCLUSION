Fairness is often cited as a reason for choosing the optimal 
solution in terms of revenue only [22]. Robust solutions militate against
bids deemed brittle, therefore bidders must earn a reputation for
being reliable to relax the reparability constraint attached to their
bids. This may be seen as being fair to long-standing business
partners whose reliability is unquestioned. Internet-based auctions
are often seen as unwelcome price-gouging exercises by suppliers
in many sectors [6, 17]. Traditional business partnerships are 
being severed by increased competition amongst suppliers. Quality
of Service can suffer because of the increased focus on short-term
profitability to the detriment of the bid-taker in the long-term. 
Robust solutions can provide a means of selectively discriminating
against distrusted bidders in a measured manner. As 
combinatorial auction deployment moves from large value auctions with a
small pool of trusted bidders (e.g. spectrum-rights sales) towards
lower value auctions with potentially unknown bidders (e.g. 
Supply Chain Management [30]), solution robustness becomes more
relevant. As well as being used to ensure that the bid-taker is not
left vulnerable to bid withdrawal, it may also be used to cement
relationships with preferred, possibly incumbent, suppliers.

We have shown that it is possible to attain robust solutions for
CAs with only a small loss in revenue. We have also illustrated
how such solutions tend to have fewer winning bids than overall
optimal solutions, thereby reducing any overheads associated with
dealing with more bidders. We have also demonstrated that 
introducing mutual bid bonds, a form of leveled commitment contract,
can significantly increase the revenue of optimal robust solutions
by improving reparability. We contend that robust solutions 
using such a mechanism can allow a bid-taker to offer the possibility
of bid withdrawal to bidders whilst remaining confident about 
postrepair revenue and also facilitating increased bidder aggressiveness.
