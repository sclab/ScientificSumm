Before presenting the technical details of our solution to the
Bid-taker"s Exposure Problem, we shall present a brief survey
of combinatorial auctions and existing techniques for handling bid
withdrawal.
Combinatorial auctions involve a single bid-taker allocating 
multiple distinguishable items amongst a group of bidders. The 
bidtaker has a set of m items for sale, M = {1, 2, . . . , m}, and 
bidders submit a set of bids, B = {B1, B2, . . . , Bn}. A bid is a tuple
Bj = Sj, pj where Sj ⊆ M is a subset of the items for sale and
pj ≥ 0 is a price. The WDP for a CA is to label all bids as either
winning or losing so as to maximize the revenue from winning bids
without allocating any item to more than one bid. The following is
the integer programming formulation for the WDP:
max
n
j=1
pjxj s.t.
j|i∈Sj
xj ≤ 1, ∀i ∈ {1 . . . m}, xj ∈ {0, 1}.
This problem is NP-complete [23] and inapproximable [25],
and is otherwise known as the Set Packing Problem. The above
problem formulation assumes the notion of free disposal. This
means that the optimal solution need not necessarily sell all of the
items. If the auction rules stipulate that all items must be sold, the
problem becomes a Set Partition Problem [5]. The WDP has been
extensively studied in recent years. The fastest search algorithms
that find optimal solutions (e.g. CABOB [25]) can, in practice,
solve very large problems involving thousands of bids very quickly.
2.1 The Problem of Bid Withdrawal
We assume an auction protocol with a three stage process 
involving the submission of bids, winner determination, and finally
a transaction phase. We are interested in bid withdrawals that 
occur between the announcement of winning bids and the end of the
transaction phase. All bids are valid until the transaction is 
complete, so we anticipate an expedient transaction process1
.

In some instances the transaction period may be so lengthy that
consideration of non-winning bids as still being valid may not be
fair. Breaks that occur during a lengthy transaction phase are more
difficult to remedy and may require a subsequent auction. For 
example, if the item is a service contract for a given period of time and
the break occurs after partial fulfilment of this contract, the other
An example of a winning bid withdrawal occurred in an FCC
spectrum auction [32]. Withdrawals, or breaks, may occur for 
various reasons. Bid withdrawal may be instigated by the bid-taker
when Quality of Service agreements are broken or payment 
deadlines are not met. We refer to bid withdrawal by the bid-taker as
item withdrawal in this paper to distinguish between the actions
of a bidder and the bid-taker. Harstad and Rothkopf [8] outlined
several possibilities for breaks in single item auctions that include:
1. an erroneous initial valuation/bid;
2. unexpected events outside the winning bidder"s control;
3. a desire to have the second-best bid honored;
4. information obtained or events that occurred after the auction
but before the transaction that reduces the value of an item;
5. the revelation of competing bidders" valuations infers reduced
profitability, a problem known as the Winner"s Curse.
Kastner et al. [15] examined how to handle perturbations given
a solution whilst minimizing necessary changes to that solution.
These perturbations may include bid withdrawals, change of 
valuation/items of a bid or the submission of a new bid. They looked at
the problem of finding incremental solutions to restructure a 
supply chain whose formation is determined using combinatorial 
auctions [30]. Following a perturbation in the optimal solution they
proceed to impose involuntary item withdrawals from winning 
bidders. They formulated an incremental integer linear program (ILP)
that sought to maximize the valuation of the repair solution whilst
preserving the previous solution as much as possible.
2.2 Being Proactive against Bid Withdrawal
When a bid is withdrawn there may be constraints on how the
solution can be repaired. If the bid-taker was freely able to revoke
the awarding of items to other bidders then the solution could be
repaired easily by reassigning all the items to the optimal solution
without the withdrawn bid. Alternatively, the bidder who reneged
upon a bid may have all his other bids disqualified and the items
could be reassigned based on the optimum solution without that
bidder present. However, the bid-taker is often unable to freely
reassign the items already awarded to other bidders. When items
cannot be withdrawn from winning bidders, following the failure of
another bidder to honor his bid, repair solutions are restricted to the
set of bids whose items only include those in the bid(s) that were
reneged upon. We are free to award items to any of the previously
unsuccessful bids when finding a repair solution.
When faced with uncertainty over the reliability of bidders a 
possible approach is to maximize expected revenue. This approach
does not make allowances for risk-averse bid-takers who may view
a small possibility of very low revenue as unacceptable.
Consider the example in Table 1, and the optimal expected 
revenue in the situation where a single bid may be withdrawn. There
are three submitted bids for items A and B, the third being a 
combination bid for the pair of items at a value of 190. The optimal
solution has a value of 200, with the first and second bids as 
winners. When we consider the probabilities of failure, in the fourth
column, the problem of which solution to choose becomes more
difficult.
Computing the expected revenue for the solution with the first
and second bids winning the items, denoted 1, 1, 0 , gives:
(200×0.9×0.9)+(2×100×0.9×0.1)+(190×0.1×0.1) = 181.90.
bidders" valuations for the item may have decreased in a non-linear
fashion.

Table 1: Example Combinatorial Auction.
Items
Bids A B AB Withdrawal prob
x1 100 0 0 0.1
x2 0 100 0 0.1
x3 0 0 190 0.1
If a single bid is withdrawn there is probability of 0.18 of a revenue
of 100, given the fact that we cannot withdraw an item from the
other winning bidder. The expected revenue for 0, 0, 1 is:
(190 × 0.9) + (200 × 0.1) = 191.00.
We can therefore surmise that the second solution is preferable to
the first based on expected revenue.
Determining the maximum expected revenue in the presence of
such uncertainty becomes computationally infeasible however, as
the number of brittle bids grows. A WDP needs to be solved for all
possible combinations of bids that may fail. The possible loss in
revenue for breaks is also not tightly bounded using this approach,
therefore a large loss may be possible for a small number of breaks.
Consider the previous example where the bid amount for x3 
becomes 175. The expected revenue of 1, 1, 0 (181.75) becomes
greater than that of 0, 0, 1 (177.50). There are some bid-takers
who may prefer the latter solution because the revenue is never less
than 175, but the former solution returns revenue of only 100 with
probability 0.18. A risk-averse bid-taker may not tolerate such a
possibility, preferring to sacrifice revenue for reduced risk.
If we modify our repair search so that a solution of at least a
given revenue is guaranteed, the search for a repair solution 
becomes a satisfiability test rather than an optimization problem. The
approaches described above are in contrast to that which we 
propose in the next section. Our approach can be seen as preventative
in that we find an initial allocation of items to bidders which is 
robust to bid withdrawal. Possible losses in revenue are bounded by
a fixed percentage of the true optimal allocation. Perturbations to
the original solution are also limited so as to minimize disruption.
We regard this as the ideal approach for real-world combinatorial
auctions.
DEFINITION 1 (ROBUST SOLUTION FOR A CA). A robust
solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of
successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or
equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most
β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution.
Constraints on acceptable revenue, e.g. being a minimum 
percentage of the optimum, are defined in the problem model and are
thus satisfied by all solutions. The maximum cost of repair, β, may
be a fixed value that may be thought of as a fund for 
compensating winning bidders whose items are withdrawn from them when
creating a repair solution. Alternatively, β may be a function of
the bids that were withdrawn. Section 4 will give an example of
such a mechanism. In the following section we describe an ideal
constraint-based framework for the establishment of such robust
solutions.
