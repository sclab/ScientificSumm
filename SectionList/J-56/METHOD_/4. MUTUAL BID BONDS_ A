BACKTRACKING MECHANISM
Some auction solutions are inherently brittle and it may be 
impossible to find a robust solution. If we can alter the rules of an
auction so that the bid-taker can retract items from winning 
bidders, then the reparability of solutions to such auctions may be 
improved. In this section we propose an auction model that permits
bid and item withdrawal by the bidders and bid-taker, respectively.
We propose a model that incorporates mutual bid bonds to enable
solution reparability for the bid-taker, a form of insurance against

the winner"s curse for the bidder whilst also compensating bidders
in the case of item withdrawal from winning bids. We propose that
such Winner"s Curse & Bid-taker"s Exposure insurance comprise
a fixed percentage, κ, of the bid amount for all bids. Such mutual
bid bonds are mandatory for each bid in our model2
. The conditions
attached to the bid bonds are that the bid-taker be allowed to annul
winning bids (item withdrawal) when repairing breaks elsewhere
in the solution. In the interests of fairness, compensation is paid
to bidders from whom items are withdrawn and is equivalent to the
penalty that would have been imposed on the bidder should he have
withdrawn the bid.
Combinatorial auctions impose a heavy computational burden
on the bidder so it is important that the hedging of risk should be
a simple and transparent operation for the bidder so as not to 
further increase this burden unnecessarily. We also contend that it
is imperative that the bidder knows the potential penalty for 
withdrawal in advance of bid submission. This information is essential
for bidders when determining how aggressive they should be in
their bidding strategy. Bid bonds are commonplace in procurement
for construction projects. Usually they are mandatory for all bids,
are a fixed percentage, κ, of the bid amount and are unidirectional
in that item withdrawal by the bid-taker is not permitted. Mutual
bid bonds may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract
in which both parties may break the contract for the same fixed
penalty. Such contracts permit unilateral decommitment for 
prespecified penalties. Sandholm et al. showed that this can increase
the expected payoffs of all parties and enables deals that would be
impossible under full commitment [26, 28, 29].
In practice a bid bond typically ranges between 5 and 20% of the
2
Making the insurance optional may be beneficial in some 
instances. If a bidder does not agree to the insurance, it may be 
inferred that he may have accurately determined the valuation for the
items and therefore less likely to fall victim to the winner"s curse.
The probability of such a bid being withdrawn may be less, so a 
repair solution may be deemed unnecessary for this bid. On the other
hand it decreases the reparability of solutions.
bid amount [14, 18]. If the decommitment penalties are the same
for both parties in all bids, κ does not influence the reparability of
a given set of bids. It merely influences the levels of penalties and
compensation transacted by agents. Low values of κ incur low bid
withdrawal penalties and simulate a dictatorial bid-taker who does
not adequately compensate bidders for item withdrawal. Andersson
and Sandholm [1] found that myopic agents reach a higher social
welfare quicker if they act selfishly rather than cooperatively when
penalties in leveled commitment contracts are low. Increased levels
of bid withdrawal are likely when the penalties are low also.
High values of κ tend towards full-commitment and reduce the
advantages of such Winner"s Curse & Bid-taker"s Exposure 
insurance. The penalties paid are used to fund a reassignment of
items to form a repair solution of sufficient revenue by 
compensating previously successful bidders for withdrawal of the items from
them.
EXAMPLE 2. Consider the example given in Table 1 once more,
where the bids also comprise a mutual bid bond of 5% of the bid
amount. If a bid is withdrawn, the bidder forfeits this amount and
the bid-taker can then compensate winning bidders whose items are
withdrawn when trying to form a repair solution later. The search
for repair solutions for breaks to bid1 and bid2 appear in Figures
2(a) and 2(b), respectively3
.
When bid1 breaks, there is a compensation penalty paid to the
bid-taker equal to 5 that can be used to fund a reassignment of the
items. We therefore set β to 5 and this becomes the maximum
expenditure allowed to withdraw items from winning bidders. β
may also be viewed as the size of the fund available to facilitate
backtracking by the bid-taker. When we extend the partial repair
for bid1 so that bid2 loses an item (branch 8.1), the overall cost of
repair increases to 5, due to this item withdrawal by the bid-taker,
3
The actual implementation of WSS search checks previous 
solutions to see if they can repair breaks before searching for a new
repair solution. 0, 0, 1 is a solution that has already been found
so the search for a repair in this example is not strictly necessary
but is described for pedagogical reasons.

and is just within the limit given by β. In Figure 1(a) the search path
follows the dashed line and sets bid3 to be 0 (branch 9). The repair
solutions for bids 1 and 2 can be extended further by assigning bid3
to 1 (branches 9.2 and 9.4). Therefore, 1, 1, 0 may be considered
a robust solution. Recall, that previously this was not the case.
Using mutual bid bonds thus increases reparability and allows a
robust solution of revenue 200 as opposed to 190, as was previously
the case.
