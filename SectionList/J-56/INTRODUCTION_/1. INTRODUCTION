A combinatorial auction (CA) [5] provides an efficient means of
allocating multiple distinguishable items amongst bidders whose
perceived valuations for combinations of items differ. Such 
auctions are gaining in popularity and there is a proliferation in their
usage across various industries such as telecoms, B2B procurement
and transportation [11, 19].
Revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such 
auctions, but another desirable attribute is solution robustness. In terms
of combinatorial auctions, a robust solution is one that can 
withstand bid withdrawal (a break) by making changes easily to form
a repair solution of adequate revenue. A brittle solution to a CA
is one in which an unacceptable loss in revenue is unavoidable if
a winning bid is withdrawn. In such situations the bid-taker may
be left with a set of items deemed to be of low value by all other
bidders. These bidders may associate a higher value for these items
if they were combined with items already awarded to others, hence
the bid-taker is left in an undesirable local optimum in which a form
of backtracking is required to reallocate the items in a manner that
results in sufficient revenue. We have called this the Bid-taker"s
Exposure Problem that bears similarities to the Exposure 
Problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit
auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items.
However, reallocating items may be regarded as disruptive to a
solution in many real-life scenarios. Consider a scenario where
procurement for a business is conducted using a CA. It would be
highly undesirable to retract contracts from a group of suppliers
because of the failure of a third party. A robust solution that is 
tolerant of such breaks is preferable. Robustness may be regarded as a
preventative measure protecting against future uncertainty by 
sacrificing revenue in place of solution stability and reparability. We
assume a probabilistic approach whereby the bid-taker has 
knowledge of the reliability of bidders from which the likelihood of an
incomplete transaction may be inferred.
Repair solutions are required for bids that are seen as brittle
(i.e. likely to break). Repairs may also be required for sets of
bids deemed brittle. We propose the use of the Weighted Super
183
Solutions (WSS) framework [13] for constraint programming, that
is ideal for establishing such robust solutions. As we shall see,
this framework can enforce constraints on solutions so that 
possible breakages are reparable.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the 
Winner Determination Problem (WDP) for combinatorial auctions, 
outlines some possible reasons for bid withdrawal and shows how 
simply maximizing expected revenue can lead to intolerable revenue
losses for risk-averse bid-takers. This motivates the use of robust
solutions and Section 3 introduces a constraint programming (CP)
framework, Weighted Super Solutions [13], that finds such 
solutions. We then propose an auction model in Section 4 that enhances
reparability by introducing mandatory mutual bid bonds, that may
be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27]. 
Section 5 presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the approach
presented in this paper, in the context of a number of well-known
combinatorial auction distributions, with very encouraging results.
Section 6 discusses possible extensions and questions raised by our
research that deserve future work. Finally, in Section 7 a number
of concluding remarks are made.
