Localized search engines index a single community of the
web, typically either a site-specific community, or a 
topicspecific community. Localized search engines enjoy three
major advantages over their large-scale counterparts: they
are relatively inexpensive to build, they can offer more 
precise search capability over their local domain, and they can
provide a more complete index.
The resources needed to build a global search engine are
enormous. A 2003 study by Lyman et al. [13] found that
the ‘surface web" (publicly available static sites) consists of
8.9 billion pages, and that the average size of these pages is
approximately 18.7 kilobytes. To download a crawl of this
size, approximately 167 terabytes of space is needed. For a
researcher who wishes to build a search engine with access
to a couple of workstations or a small server, storage of this
magnitude is simply not available. However, building a 
localized search engine over a web community of a hundred
thousand pages would only require a few gigabytes of 
storage. The computational burden required to support search
queries over a database this size is more manageable as well.
We note that, for topic-specific search engines, the relevant
community can be efficiently identified and downloaded by
using a focused crawler [21, 4].
For site-specific domains, the local domain is readily 
available on their own web server. This obviates the need for
crawling or spidering, and a complete and up-to-date 
index of the domain can thus be guaranteed. This is in 
contrast to their large-scale counterparts, which suffer from 
several shortcomings. First, crawling dynamically generated
pages-pages in the ‘hidden web"-has been the subject of
research [20] and is a non-trivial task for an external crawler.
Second, site-specific domains can enable the robots 
exclusion policy. This prohibits external search engines" crawlers
from downloading content from the domain, and an external
search engine must instead rely on outside links and anchor
text to index these restricted pages.
By restricting itself to only a specific domain of the 
internet, a localized search engine can provide more precise
search results. Consider the canonical ambiguous search
query, ‘jaguar", which can refer to either the car 
manufacturer or the animal. A scientist trying to research the 
habitat and evolutionary history of a jaguar may have better
success using a finely tuned zoology-specific search engine
than querying Google with multiple keyword searches and
wading through irrelevant results. A method to learn 
better ranking functions for retrieval was recently proposed by
Radlinski and Joachims [19] and has been applied to various
local domains, including Cornell University"s website [8].
