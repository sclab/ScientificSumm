The internet is growing exponentially, and in order to 
navigate such a large repository as the web, global search 
engines have established themselves as a necessity. Along with
the ubiquity of these large-scale search engines comes an 
increase in search users" expectations. By providing complete
and isolated coverage of a particular web domain, localized
search engines are an effective outlet to quickly locate 
content that could otherwise be difficult to find. In this work,
we contend that the use of global PageRank in a localized
search engine can improve performance.
To estimate the global PageRank, we have proposed an
iterative node selection framework where we select which
pages from the global frontier to crawl next. Our primary
contribution is our stochastic complementation page 
selection algorithm. This method crawls nodes that will most
significantly impact the local domain and has running time
linear in the number of nodes in the local domain. 
Experimentally, we validate these methods across a diverse set of
local domains, including seven site-specific domains and four
topic-specific domains. We conclude that by crawling an 
additional n or 2n pages, our methods find an estimate of the
global PageRanks that is up to ten times better than just
using the local PageRanks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that our algorithm consistently outperforms other existing
heuristics.

Often times, topic-specific domains are discovered using
a focused web crawler which considers a page"s content in
conjunction with link anchor text to decide which pages to
crawl next [4]. Although such crawlers have proven to be
quite effective in discovering topic-related content, many 
irrelevant pages are also crawled in the process. Typically,
these pages are deleted and not indexed by the localized
search engine. These pages can of course provide valuable
information regarding the global PageRank of the local 
domain. One way to integrate these pages into our framework
is to start the FindGlobalPR algorithm with the current
subgraph F equal to the set of pages that were crawled by
the focused crawler.
The global PageRank estimation framework, along with
the node selection algorithms presented, all require O(n)
computation per iteration and bandwidth proportional to
the number of pages crawled, Tk. If the number of 
iterations T is relatively small compared to the number of pages
crawled per iteration, k, then the bottleneck of the algorithm
will be the crawling phase. However, as the number of 
iterations increases (relative to k), the bottleneck will reside in
the node selection computation. In this case, our algorithms
would benefit from constant factor optimizations. Recall
that the FindGlobalPR algorithm (Algorithm 2) requires
that the PageRanks of the current expanded local domain be
recomputed in each iteration. Recent work by Langville and
Meyer [12] gives an algorithm to quickly recompute 
PageRanks of a given webgraph if a small number of nodes are
added. This algorithm was shown to give speedup of five to
ten times on some datasets. We plan to investigate this and
other such optimizations as future work.
In this paper, we have objectively evaluated our methods
by measuring how close our global PageRank estimates are
to the actual global PageRanks. To determine the 
benefit of using global PageRanks in a localized search engine,
we suggest a user study in which users are asked to rate
the quality of search results for various search queries. For
some queries, only the local PageRanks are used in 
ranking, and for the remaining queries, local PageRanks and the
approximate global PageRanks, as computed by our 
algorithms, are used. The results of such a study can then be
analyzed to determine the added benefit of using the global
PageRanks computed by our methods, over just using the
local PageRanks.
