Diffusion and Networked Coordination Games. A fundamental
question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which
new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations.
Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies,
the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions,
or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17]. An active line
of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned
with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination
game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].
We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic
diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13],
which will form the starting point for our work here. We describe
it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though
there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.
Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B,
which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system
in order to communicate. There is a social network G on the users,
indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each
edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A
or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each
receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system
B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive
a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they
each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).
Note that A is the better technology if q < 1
2
, in the sense that
A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse
technology if q > 1
2
.

A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion
model even at this level of simplicity. Specifically, consider a 
network G, and let all nodes initially play B. Now suppose a small
number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead. If we apply
best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect
will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A
if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g.
you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking
site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends
are users of it.) As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence
of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is
reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with
all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes
partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges
yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets. Morris [13] provides
a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these
qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the 
underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e.
the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).
Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality. In most of the
settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence
(however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human
languages and social conventions coexist along geographic 
boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use 
Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS. An important
piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic 
models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is 
happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the
model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.
In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very
often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become
bilingual. In the case of human language diffusion, this 
bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial
interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have
inhabitants who speak both. But bilinguality is also an essential
feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have
accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more 
generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer
systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.
Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models 
behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this
very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to 
themselves. What might we learn from such an extension? To begin
with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the
question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins 
competition among technology companies. There is a large literature
on how compatibility among technologies affects competition 
between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a 
beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9,
12]. Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different
kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies
(including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out
for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11]
and instant messenger systems [6].
While these existing models of compatibility capture network
effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use 
technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more 
finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each
user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its
own social network neighbors are doing. A diffusion model that 
incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure
of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could 
potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may
benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries
and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.
The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior. In this
paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions
of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected
phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.
We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morris"s
model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior. Consider
again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff 
structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third
strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B. An
adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever
of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff
structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB
interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of
A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both 
receive max(q, 1 − q). Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost
penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the
cost of having to maintain both technologies.
Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied:
the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and
the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility
(encoded by c).
Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite;
we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has
degree Δ.1
We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of
whether a new technology A can spread through a network where
almost everyone is initially using B. Formally, we say that strategy
A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state
in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes
adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with 
tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A. We
also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in
the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for
adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.
In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and
B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗
(G):
this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in
G with parameter q in the payoff structure. A central result of
[13] is that 1
2
is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any
graph: supG q∗
(G) = 1
2
. Indeed, there exist graphs in which the
contagion threshold is as large as 1
2
(including the infinite line - the
unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one
can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than
1
2
.
In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we
have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a 
contagion threshold q∗
(G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which
is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic
in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion 
threshold supG q∗
(G), we must consider the general epidemic region
Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular
graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become
epidemic in some Δ-regular network.

We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of
finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of
an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much
cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morris"s paper [13]): less
intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties,
and the qualitative phenomena remain the same.

can become epidemic on the infinite line.
Our Results. We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G)
can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. 
Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes
that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the
positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find
analogous shapes that become even more complex for other 
simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.) In
particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1
2
,
strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is 
sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some
intermediate interval. In other words, strategy B (which represents
the worse technology, since q < 1
2
) will survive if and only if the
cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.
This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in
the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not
too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising
that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network
structure. It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative 
interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to
give such an interpretation, as follows.
When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as
a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.
Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all
nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction 
benefits without paying the penalty of r.
When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A 
neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose
AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence
A will spread step-by-step through the network.
When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the 
interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it
most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy. Once this happens,
the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient
incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no
further progress. Hence, this intermediate value of r allows
a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and
the adopters of B.
In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets
invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes
to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of
direct conversions to A. But if it has the right balance in the value
of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary
where nodes adopt AB.
Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity
holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the 
general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G). For any given value of Δ, the
region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded 
polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.
However, we can show via a potential function argument that no
point (q, r) with q > 1
2
belongs to Ω. Moreover, we can show the
existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1
2
. On the other hand,
consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that
(1
2
, r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large. Hence, neither Ω
nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.
Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for
the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate
characterization of the region Ω(G). In Morris"s setting, without an
AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with 
parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset
S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in
S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other
words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to 
diffusion in his setting. With the AB strategy as a further option, a more
complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot 
become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite
set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with
a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes. We show that
such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B
inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and
conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.
The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a
number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking,
that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the 
order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each
node attempts to update itself infinitely often).
Further Extensions. Another way to model compatibility and 
interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms
representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A
and a node adopting B. Rather than setting these to 0, we can 
consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q). We find that
for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more
general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of
q and r, to one where x = 0. Moreover, using our 
characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we
show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph
G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can
still become epidemic with the new parameters.
We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an 
extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and
Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge
and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.
We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which
initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third,
better technology A at a finite set of nodes. We show an example
in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in
a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too
high to lie in this range. Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model
with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an
incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing
their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market.
