We begin by considering some basic examples that yield 
epidemic regions with the kinds of non-convexity properties discussed

Note that in our definition we assume that agents in T are endowed
with the strategy A at the beginning. Alternatively, one can define
the notion of epidemic by allowing agents in T to be endowed with
any combination of AB and A, or with just AB. However, the
difference between these definitions is rather minor and our results
carry over with little or no change to these alternative models.

Note that we assume agents in the seed set T cannot change their
strategy.

Figure 2: The thick line graph
in Section 1. We first discuss a natural Δ-regular generalization of
the infinite line graph, and for this one we work out the complete
analysis that describes the region Ω(G), the set of all pairs (q, r)
for which the technology A can become an epidemic. We then 
describe, without the accompanying detailed analysis, the epidemic
regions for the infinite Δ-regular tree and for the two-dimensional
grid.
The infinite line and the thick line graph. For a given even 
integer Δ, we define the thick line graph LΔ as follows: the vertex
set of this graph is Z × {1, 2, . . . , Δ/2}, where Z is the set of all
integers. There is an edge between vertices (x, i) and (x , i ) if and
only if |x − x | = 1. For each x ∈ Z, we call the set of vertices
{(x, i) : i ∈ {1, . . . , Δ/2} the x"th group of vertices. Figure 2
shows a picture of L6
Now, assume that starting from a position where every node uses
the strategy B, we endow all agents in a group (say, group 0) with
the strategy A. Consider the decision faced by the agents in group
1, who have their right-hand neighbors using B and their left-hand
neighbors using A. For these agents, the payoffs of strategies A,
B, and AB are (1 − q)Δ/2, qΔ/2, and Δ/2 − rΔ, respectively.
Therefore, if
q ≤

and q ≤ 2r,
the best response of such an agent is A. Hence, if the above 
inequality holds and we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . play
their best response in this order, then A will become an epidemic.
Also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best response of
an agent with her neighbors on one side playing A and neighbors
on the other side playing B is the strategy AB. Therefore, if we
let agents in groups 1 and −1 change to their best response, they
would switch their strategy to AB. After this, agents in group 2
will see AB on their left and B on their right. For these agents
(and similarly for the agents in group −2), the payoff of strategies
A, B, and AB are (1−q)Δ/2, qΔ, and (q+max(q, 1−q))Δ/2−
rΔ, respectively. Therefore, if max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 1 − q and
max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 2q, or equivalently, if
2r ≤ q and q + r ≤
1
2
,
the best response of such an agent is AB. Hence, if the above
inequality holds and we let agents in groups 2, −2, 3, −3 . . . play
their best response in this order, then every agent (except for agents
in group 0) switches to AB. Next, if we let agents in groups
1, −1, 2, −2, . . . change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2, 
every agent will switch to strategy A, and hence A becomes an 
epidemic.4

Strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as
a single infinite sequence of vertices in V (G) \ T, the order
1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . is not a valid schedule. 
However, since vertices of G have finite degree, it is not hard to see
that any ordering of a multiset containing any (possibly infinite)

Figure 4: Epidemic regions for the infinite Δ-regular tree
The above argument shows that for any combination of (q, r)
parameters in the marked region in Figure 1, technology A can
become an epidemic. It is not hard to see that for points outside
this region, A cannot become epidemic.
Further examples: trees and grids. Figures 3 and 4 show the
epidemic regions for the infinite grid and the infinite Δ-regular tree.
Note they also exhibit non-convexities.
