We now develop some further notation and definitions that will
be useful for expressing the model. Recall that we have an infinite
Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in
a coordination game on each edge. For edge (v, w), the payoff
77
to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A
and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A
and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B
and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both
choose strategy AB. The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of
the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0
if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB. We refer to
the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game,
and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).
This game can have many Nash equilibria. In particular, the
two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses
technology B are both equilibria of this game. As discussed in
the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching
an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know
whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A
equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents,
and following a sequence of best-response moves.
We provide a formal description of this question via the 
following two definitions.
DEFINITION 2.1. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r). A state
in this game is a strategy profile s : V (G) → {A, B, AB}. For
two states s and s and a vertex v ∈ V (G), if starting from state s
and letting v play her best-response move (breaking ties in favor of
A and then AB) we get to the state s , we write s
v
→ s . Similarly,
for two states s and s and a finite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . , vk of
vertices of G (where vi"s are not necessarily distinct), we say s
S
→
s if there is a sequence of states s1, . . . , sk−1 such that s
v1
→ s1
v2
→
s2
v3
→ · · · sk−1
vk
→ s . For an infinite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . of
vertices of G, we denote the subsequence v1, v2, . . . , vk by Sk. We
say s
S
→ s for two states s and s if for every vertex v ∈ V (G)
there exists a k0(v) such that for every k > k0(v), s
Sk
→ sk for a
state sk with sk(v) = s (v).
DEFINITION 2.2. For T ⊆ V (G), we denote by sT the strategy
profile that assigns A to every agent in T and B to every agent in
V (G) \ T. We say that technology A can become an epidemic in
the game (G, q, r) if there is a finite set T of nodes in G (called the
seed set) and a sequence S of vertices in V (G) \ T (where each
vertex can appear more than once) such that sT
S
→ sV (G), i.e.,
endowing agents in T with technology A and letting other agents
play their best response according to schedule S would lead every
agent to eventually adopt strategy A.2
The above definition requires that the all-A equilibrium be 
reachable from the initial state by at least one schedule S of best-response
moves. In fact, we will show in Section 4 that if A can become
an epidemic in a game, then for every schedule of best-response
moves of the nodes in V (G) \ T in which each node is scheduled
an infinite number of times, eventually all nodes adopt strategy A.3
