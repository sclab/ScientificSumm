We now consider some further ways of modeling compatibility
and interoperability. We first consider two technologies, as in the
previous sections, and introduce off-diagonal payoffs to capture
a positive benefit in direct A-B interactions. We find that this is
81
in fact no more general than the model with zero payoffs for A-B
interactions.
We then consider extensions to three technologies, identifying
situations in which two coexisting incumbent technologies may or
may not want to increases their mutual compatibility in the face of
a new, third technology.
Two technologies. A natural relaxation of the two-technology model
is to introduce (small) positive payoffs for A-B interaction; that is,
cross-technology communication yields some lesser value to both
agents. We can model this using a variable xAB representing the
payoff gathered by an agent with technology A when her 
neighbor has technology B, and similarly, a variable xBA representing
the payoff gathered by an agent with B when her neighbor has A.
Here we consider the special case in which these off-diagonal 
entries are symmetric, i.e., xAB = xBA = x. We also assume that
x < q ≤ 1 − q.
We first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is 
equivalent to a game without these entries, under a simple re-scaling of
q and r. Note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive
or a multiplicative constant, the behavior of the game is unaffected.
Given a game with off-diagonal entries parameterized by q, r and x,
consider subtracting x from all payoffs, and scaling up by a factor
of 1/(1 − 2x). As can be seen by examining Table 1, the resulting
payoffs are exactly those of a game without off-diagonal entries,
parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x).
Thus the addition of symmetric off-diagonal entries does not 
expand the class of games being considered.
Table 1 represents the payoffs in the coordination game in terms
of these parameters.
Nevertheless, we can still ask how the addition of an off-diagonal
entry might affect the outcome of any particular game. As the 
following example shows, increasing compatibility between two 
technologies can allow one technology that was not initially epidemic
to become so.
EXAMPLE 6.1. Consider the contagion game played on a thick
line graph (see Section 3) with r = 5/32 and q = 3/8. In this
case, A is not epidemic, as can be seen by examining Figure 1,
since 2r < q and q + r > 1/2. However, if we insert symmetric
off-diagonal payoffs x = 1/4, we have a new game, equivalent to a
game parameterized by r = 5/16 and q = 1/4. Since q < 1/2
and q < 2r , A is epidemic in this game, and thus also in the game
with limited compatibility.
We now show that generally, if A is the superior technology (i.e.,
q < 1/2), adding a compatibility term x can only help A spread.
THEOREM 6.2. Let G be a game without compatibility, 
parameterized by r and q on a particular network. Let G be that same
game, but with an added symmetric compatibility term x. If A is
epidemic for G, then A is epidemic for G .
PROOF. We will show that any blocking structure in G is also
a blocking structure in G. By our characterization theorem, 
Theorem 4.6, this implies the desired result. We have that G is 
equivalent to a game without compatibility parameterized by q = (q −
x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x). Consider a blocking structure
(SB, SAB) for G . We know that for any v ∈ SAB, q dSB (v) >
r Δ. Thus
qdSB (v) > (q − x)dSB (v)
= q (1 − 2x)dSB (v)
> r (1 − 2x)Δ
= rΔ,
as required for a blocking structure in G. Similarly, the two 
blocking structure constraints for v ∈ SB are only strengthened when
we move from G to G.
More than two technologies. Given the complex structure 
inherent in contagion games with two technologies, the understanding of
contagion games with three or more technologies is largely open.
Here we indicate some of the technical issues that come up with
multiple technologies, through a series of initial results. The 
basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies B
and C are initially coexisting, and a third technology A, superior
to both, is introduced initially at a finite set of nodes.
We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ, there is
a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two 
incumbent technologies B and C may find it beneficial to increase their
compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new 
superior technology A. In particular, we consider a situation in which
initially, two technologies B and C with zero compatibility are at
a stable state. By a stable state, we mean that no finite 
perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either B or
C. We also have a technology A that is superior to both B and C,
and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose A.
However, by increasing their compatibility, B and C can maintain
their stability and resist an epidemic from A.
Let qA denote the payoffs to two adjacent nodes that both choose
technology A, and define qB and qC analogously. We will assume
qA > qB > qC . We also assume that r, the cost of selecting
additional technologies, is sufficiently large so as to ensure that
nodes never adopt more than one technology. Finally, we 
consider a compatibility parameter qBC that represents the payoffs
to two adjacent nodes when one selects B and the other selects
C. Thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters
(G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ).
THEOREM 6.3. For any even Δ ≥ 12, there is a Δ-regular
graph G, an initial state s, and values qA, qB, qC , and qBC , such
that
• s is an equilibrium in both (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) and
(G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ),
• neither B nor C can become epidemic in either
(G, qA, qB, qC , 0) or (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ) starting from state
s,
• A can become epidemic (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) starting from state
s, and
• A can not become epidemic in (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC )
starting from state s.
PROOF. (Sketch.) Given Δ, define G by starting with an infinite
grid and connecting each node to its nearest Δ − 2 neighbors that
are in the same row. The initial state s assigns strategy B to even
rows and strategy C to odd rows. Let qA = 4k2
+ 4k + 1/2,
qB = 2k + 2, qC = 2k + 1, and qBC = 2k + 3/4. The first, third,
and fourth claims in the theorem can be verified by checking the
corresponding inequalities. The second claim follows from the first
and the observation that the alternating rows contain any plausible
epidemic from growing vertically.
The above theorem shows that two technologies may both be
able to survive the introduction of a new technology by increasing
their level of compatibility with each other. As one might expect,
82
A B AB
A (1 − q; 1 − q) (x; x) (1 − q; 1 − q − r)
B (x; x) (q; q) (q; q − r)
AB (1 − q − r; 1 − q) (q − r; q) (max(q, 1 − q) − r; max(q, 1 − q) − r)

the column player gets a payoff of y when the row player plays strategy i and the column player plays strategy j.
there are cases when increased compatibility between two 
technologies helps one technology at the expense of the other. 
Surprisingly, however, there are also instances in which compatibility
is in fact harmful to both parties; the next example considers a fixed
initial configuration with technologies A, B and C that is at 
equilibrium when qBC = 0. However, if this compatibility term is 
increased sufficiently, equilibrium is lost, and A becomes epidemic.
EXAMPLE 6.4. Consider the union of an infinite two-dimensional
grid graph with nodes u(x, y) and an infinite line graph with nodes
v(y). Add an edge between u(1, y) and v(y) for all y. For this 
network, we consider the initial configuration in which all v(y) nodes
select A, and node u(x, y) selects B if x < 0 and selects C 
otherwise.
We now define the parameters of this game as follows. Let qA =
3.95, qB = 1.25, qC = 1, and qBC = 0. It is easily verified that
for these values, the initial configuration given above is an 
equilibrium. However, now suppose we increase the coordination term,
setting qBC = 0.9. This is not an equilibrium, since each node of
the form u(0, y) now has an incentive to switch from C (generating
a payoff of 3.9) to B (thereby generating a payoff of 3.95). 
However, once these nodes have adopted B, the best-response for each
node of the form u(1, y) is A (A generates a payoff of 4 where as
B only generates a payoff of 3.95). From here, it is not hard to
show that A spreads directly throughout the entire network.
