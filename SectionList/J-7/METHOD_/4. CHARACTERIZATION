In this section, we characterize equilibrium properties of 
contagion games. To this end, we must first argue that contagion games
in fact have well-defined and stable equilibria. We then discuss
some respects in which the equilibrium reached from an initial state
is essentially independent of the order in which best-response 
updates are performed.
We begin with the following lemma, which proves that agents
eventually converge to a fixed strategy, and so the final state of a
game is well-defined by its initial state and an infinite sequence of
moves. Specifically, we prove that once an agent decides to adopt
technology A, she never discards it, and once she decides to discard
technology B, she never re-adopts it. Thus, after an infinite number
of best-response moves, each agent converges to a single strategy.
LEMMA 4.1. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a 
(possibly infinite) subset T ⊆ V (G) of agents. Let sT be the strategy
profile assigning A to every agent in T and B to every agent in
V (G) \ T. Let S = v1, v2, . . . be a (possibly infinite) sequence of
number of copies of each vertex of V (G) \ T can be turned
into an equivalent schedule of moves. For example, the sequence
1, −1, 2, −2, 1, −1, 3, −3, 2, −2, . . . gives the same outcome as
1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . in the thick line example.
agents in V (G) \ T and consider the sequence of states s1, s2, . . .
obtained by allowing agents to play their best-response in the order
defined by S (i.e., s
v1
→ s1
v2
→ s2
v3
→ · · · ). Then for every i, one of
the following holds:
• si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = A,
• si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = AB,
• si(vi+1) = AB and si+1(vi+1) = A,
• si(vi+1) = si+1(vi+1).
PROOF. Let X >k
v Y indicate that agent v (weakly) prefers
strategy X to strategy Y in state sk. For any k let zk
A, zk
B, and zk
AB
be the number of neighbors of v with strategies A, B, and AB in
state sk, respectively. Thus, for agent v in state sk,
1. A >k
v B if (1 − q)(zk
A + zk
AB) is greater than q(zk
B + zk
AB),
2. A >k
v AB if (1− q)(zk
A + zk
AB) is greater than (1− q)zk
A +
qzk
B + max(q, 1 − q)zk
AB − Δr,
3. and AB >k
v B if (1−q)zk
A +qzk
B +max(q, 1−q)zk
AB −Δr
is greater than q(zk
B + zk
AB).
Suppose the lemma is false and consider the smallest i such that the
lemma is violated. Let v = vi+1 be the agent who played her best
response at time i. Thus, either 1. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = B,
or 2. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = AB, or 3. si(v) = AB and
si+1(v) = B. We show that in the third case, agent v could not
have been playing a best response. The other cases are similar.
In the third case, we have si(v) = AB and si+1(v) = B. As
si(v) = AB, there must be a time j < i where sj
v
→ sj+1 and
sj+1(v) = AB. Since this was a best-response move for v, 
inequality 3 implies that (1 − q)zj
A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj
AB ≥ Δr.
Furthermore, as i is the earliest time at which the lemma is 
violated, zi
A ≥ zj
A and zj
AB − zi
AB ≤ zi
A − zj
A. Thus, the change Q
in payoff between AB and B (plus Δr) is
Q ≡ (1 − q)zi
A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zi
AB
≥ (1 − q)(zi
A − zj
A + zj
A)
+ max(0, 1 − 2q)(zj
AB − zi
A + zj
A)
= (1 − q)zj
A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj
AB
+ max(q, 1 − q)(zi
A − zj
A)
≥ (1 − q)zj
A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj
AB
≥ Δr,
and so, by inequality 3, B can not be a better response than AB for
v in state si.
COROLLARY 4.2. For every infinite sequence S of vertices in
V (G) \ T, there is a unique state s such that s0
S
→ s, where s0
denotes the initial state where every vertex in T plays A and every
vertex in V (G) \ T plays B.
Such a state s is called the outcome of the game (G, q, r) starting
from T and using the schedule S.
Equivalence of best-response schedules. Lemma 4.1 shows that
the outcome of a game is well-defined and unique. The following
theorems show that the outcome is also invariant to the dynamics,
or sequence of best-response moves, under certain mild conditions.
The first theorem states that if the all-A equilibrium is the outcome
of a game for some (unconstrained) schedule, then it is the outcome
for any schedule in which each vertex is allowed to move infinitely
many times. The second theorem states that the outcome of a game
is the same for any schedule of moves in which every vertex moves
infinitely many times.

THEOREM 4.3. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r), a subset
T ⊆ V (G), and a schedule S of vertices in V (G) \ T such that
the outcome of the game is the all-A equilibrium. Then for any
schedule S of vertices in V (G) \ T such that every vertex in this
set occurs infinitely many times, the outcome of the game using the
schedule S is also the all-A equilibrium.
PROOF. Note that S is a subsequence of S . Let π : S → S be
the injection mapping S to its subsequence in S . We show for any
vi ∈ S, if vi switches to AB, then π(vi) switches to AB or A, and
if vi switches to A, then π(vi) switches to A (here v switches to
X means that after the best-response move, the strategy of v is X).
Suppose not and let i be the smallest integer such that the statement
doesn"t hold. Let zA, zB, and zAB be the number of neighbors of
vi with strategies A, B, and AB in the current state defined by S.
Define zA,zB, and zAB similarly for S . Then, by Lemma 4.1 and
the choice of i, zA ≥ zA, zB ≤ zB, zAB − zAB ≤ zB − zB, and
zAB − zAB ≤ zA − zA. Now suppose vi switches to AB. Then
the same sequence of inequalities as in Lemma 4.1 show that AB
is a better response than B for π(vi) (although A might be the best
response) and so π(vi) switches to either AB or A. The other case
(vi switches to A) is similar.
THEOREM 4.4. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a 
subset T ⊆ V (G). Then for every two schedules S and S of vertices
in V (G)\T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many
times in each of these schedules, the outcomes of the game using
these schedules are the same.
PROOF. The proof of this theorem is similar to that of 
theorem 4.3 and is deferred to the full version of the paper.
Blocking structures. Finally, we prove the characterization 
mentioned in the introduction: A cannot become epidemic if and only
if (G, q, r) possesses a certain kind of blocking structure. This 
result generalizes Morris"s theorem on the contagion threshold for
his model; in his case without AB as a possible strategy, a simpler
kind of community structure was the obstacle to A becoming
epidemic.
We begin by defining the blocking structures.
DEFINITION 4.5. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r). A pair
(SAB, SB) of disjoint subsets of V (G) is called a blocking 
structure for this game if for every vertex v ∈ SAB,
degSB
(v) >
r
q
Δ,
and for every vertex v ∈ SB,
(1 − q) degSB
(v) + min(q, 1 − q) degSAB
(v) > (1 − q − r)Δ,
and
degSB
(v) + q degSAB
(v) > (1 − q)Δ,
where degS(v) denotes the number of neighbors of v in the set S.
THEOREM 4.6. For every contagion game (G, q, r), 
technology A cannot become epidemic in this game if and only if every
co-finite set of vertices of G contains a blocking structure.
PROOF. We first show that if every co-finite set of vertices of
G contains a blocking structure, then technology A cannot become
epidemic. Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with 
technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained
in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any 
sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and
the vertices in SB have strategy B. Suppose not and let v be the first
vertex in sequence S to violate this (i.e., v ∈ SAB switches to A or
v ∈ SB switches to A or AB). Suppose v ∈ SAB (the other cases
are similar). Let zA, zB, and zAB denote the number of neighbors
of v with strategies A, B, and AB respectively. As v is the first
vertex violating the claim, zA ≤ Δ− degSB
(v)− degSAB
(v) and
zB ≥ degSB
(v). We show AB is a better strategy than A for v.
To show this, we must prove that (1 − q)zA + qzB + max(q, 1 −
q)zAB − Δr > (1 − q)(zA + zAB) or, equivalently, the quantity
Q ≡ qzB + max(2q − 1, 0)zAB − Δr > 0:
Q = (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ − max(2q − 1, 0)zA
+(q − max(2q − 1, 0))zB
≥ (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ + min(q, 1 − q) degSB
(v)
− max(2q − 1, 0)(Δ − degSB
(v) − degSAB
(v))
≥ [min(q, 1 − q) + max(2q − 1, 0)] degSB
(v) − rΔ
= q degSB
(v) − rΔ
> 0,
where the last inequality holds by the definition of the blocking
structure.
We next show that A cannot become epidemic if and only if 
every co-finite set of vertices contains a blocking structure. To 
construct a blocking structure for the complement of a finite set T of
vertices, endow T with strategy A and consider the outcome of
the game for any sequence S which schedules each vertex an 
infinite number of times. Let SAB be the set of vertices with 
strategy AB and SB be the set of vertices with strategy B in this
outcome. Note for any v ∈ SAB, AB is a best-response and so
is strictly better than strategy A, i.e. q degSB
(v) + max(q, 1 −
q) degSAB
−Δr > (1− q) degSAB
(v), from where it follows that
degSB
(v) > (rΔ)/q. The inequalities for the vertices v ∈ SB can
be derived in a similar manner.
A corollary to the above theorem is that for every infinite graph
G, the epidemic regions in the q-r plane for this graph is a finite
union of bounded and unbounded polygons. This is because the
inequalities defining blocking structures are linear inequalities in
q and r, and the coefficients of these inequalities can take only
finitely many values.
