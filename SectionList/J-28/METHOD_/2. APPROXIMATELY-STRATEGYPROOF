VCG AUCTIONS
In this section, we first describe the marginal-decreasing 
piecewise bidding language that is used in our forward and reverse
auctions. Continuing, we introduce the VCG mechanism for the
problem and the ε-dominance results for approximations to VCG
outcomes. We also discuss the economic properties of VCG
mechanisms in these forward and reverse auction multi-unit 
settings.
2.1 Marginal-Decreasing Piecewise Bids
We provide a piecewise-constant and marginal-decreasing 
bidding language. This bidding language is expressive for a 
natural class of valuation and cost functions: fixed unit prices over
intervals of quantities. See Figure 1 for an example. In 
addition, we slightly relax the marginal-decreasing requirement to
allow: a bidder in the forward auction to state a minimal 
purchase amount, such that she has zero value for quantities smaller
than that amount; a seller in the reverse auction to state a capacity
constraint, such that she has an effectively infinite cost to supply
quantities in excess of a particular amount.

Forward Auction Bid
Figure 1: Marginal-decreasing, piecewise constant bids. In the
forward auction bid, the bidder offers $10 per unit for quantity in
the range [5, 10), $8 per unit in the range [10, 20), and $7 in the
range [20, 25]. Her valuation is zero for quantities outside the range
[10, 25]. In the reverse auction bid, the cost of the seller is ∞ outside
the range [10, 25].
In detail, in a forward auction, a bid from buyer i can be
written as a list of (quantity-range, unit-price) tuples, ((u1
i , p1
i ),
(u2
i , p2
i ), . . . , (umi−1
i , pmi−1
i )), with an upper bound umi
i on the
quantity. The interpretation is that the bidder"s valuation in the
167
(semi-open) quantity range [uj
i , uj+1
i ) is pj
i for each unit. 
Additionally, it is assumed that the valuation is 0 for quantities less
than u1
i as well as for quantities more than um
i . This is 
implemented by adding two dummy bid tuples, with zero prices in the
range [0, u1
i ) and (umi
i , ∞). We interpret the bid list as 
defining a price function, pbid,i(q) = qpj
i , if uj
i ≤ q < uj+1
i , where
j = 1, 2, . . . , mi −1. In order to resolve the boundary condition,
we assume that the bid price for the upper bound quantity umi
i is
pbid,i(umi
i ) = umi
i pmi−1
i .
A seller"s bid is similarly defined in the reverse auction. The
interpretation is that the bidder"s cost in the (semi-open) 
quantity range [uj
i , uj+1
i ) is pj
i for each unit. Additionally, it is 
assumed that the cost is ∞ for quantities less than u1
i as well as
for quantities more than um
i . Equivalently, the unit prices in the
ranges [0, u1
i ) and (um
i , ∞) are infinity. We interpret the bid list
as defining a price function, pask,i(q) = qpj
i , if uj
i ≤ q < uj+1
i .
2.2 VCG-Based Multi-Unit Auctions
We construct the tractable and approximately-strategyproof 
multiunit auctions around a VCG mechanism. We assume that all
agents have quasilinear utility functions; that is, ui(q, p) = vi(q)−
p, for a buyer i with valuation vi(q) for q units at price p, and
ui(q, p) = p − ci(q) for a seller i with cost ci(q) at price p. This
is a standard assumption in the auction literature, equivalent to
assuming risk-neutral agents [13]. We will use the term payoff
interchangeably for utility.
In the forward auction, there is a seller with M units to sell.
We assume that this seller has no intrinsic value for the items.
Given a set of bids from I agents, let V (I) denote the maximal
revenue to the seller, given that at most one point on the bid curve
can be selected from each agent and no more than M units of the
item can be sold. Let x∗
= (x∗
1, . . . , x∗
N ) denote the solution
to this winner- determination problem, where x∗
i is the number
of units sold to agent i. Similarly, let V (I \ i) denote the 
maximal revenue to the seller without bids from agent i. The VCG
mechanism is defined as follows:
1. Receive piecewise-constant bid curves and capacity 
constraints from all the buyers.
2. Implement the outcome x∗
that solves the winner-determination
problem with all buyers.
3. Collect payment pvcg,i = pbid,i(x∗
i ) − [V (I) − V (I \ i)]
from each buyer, and pass the payments to the seller.
In this forward auction, the VCG mechanism is strategyproof
for buyers, which means that truthful bidding is a dominant 
strategy, i.e. utility maximizing whatever the bids of other buyers.
In addition, the VCG mechanism is allocatively-efficient, and the
payments from each buyer are always positive.3
Moreover, each
buyer pays less than its value, and receives payoff V (I)−V (I \
i) in equilibrium; this is precisely the marginal-value that buyer
i contributes to the economic efficiency of the system.
In the reverse auction, there is a buyer with M units to buy,
and n suppliers. We assume that the buyer has value V > 0
to purchase all M units, but zero value otherwise. To simplify
the mechanism design problem we assume that the buyer will
truthfully announce this value to the mechanism.4
The 
winner3
In fact, the VCG mechanism maximizes the expected payoff
to the seller across all efficient mechanisms, even allowing for
Bayesian-Nash implementations [14].
4
Without this assumption, the Myerson-Satterthwaite [17] 
impossibility result would already imply that we should not expect
an efficient trading mechanism in this setting.
determination problem in the reverse auction is to determine the
allocation, x∗
, that minimizes the cost to the buyer, or forfeits
trade if the minimal cost is greater than value, V .
Let C(I) denote the minimal cost given bids from all sellers,
and let C(I \i) denote the minimal cost without bids from seller
i. We can assume, without loss of generality, that there is an
efficient trade and V ≥ C(I). Otherwise, then the efficient 
outcome is no trade, and the outcome of the VCG mechanism is no
trade and no payments.
The VCG mechanism implements the outcome x∗
that 
minimizes cost based on bids from all sellers, and then provides 
payment pvcg,i = pask,i(x∗
i )+[V −C(I)−max(0, V −C(I\i))] to
each seller. The total payment is collected from the buyer. Again,
in equilibrium each seller"s payoff is exactly the marginal-value
that the seller contributes to the economic efficiency of the 
system; in the simple case that V ≥ C(I \ i) for all sellers i, this is
precisely C(I \ i) − C(I).
Although the VCG mechanism remains strategyproof for 
sellers in the reverse direction, its applicability is limited to cases in
which the total payments to the sellers are less than the buyer"s
value. Otherwise, there will be instances in which the buyer will
not choose to voluntarily participate in the mechanism, based on
its own value and its beliefs about the costs of sellers. This leads
to a loss in efficiency when the buyer chooses not to participate,
because efficient trades are missed. This problem with the size of
the payments, does not occur in simple single-item reverse 
auctions, or even in multi-unit reverse auctions with a buyer that has
a constant marginal-valuation for each additional item that she
procures.5
Intuitively, the problem occurs in the reverse multi-unit 
setting because the buyer demands a fixed number of items, and
has zero value without them. This leads to the possibility of the
trade being contingent on the presence of particular, so-called
pivotal sellers. Define a seller i as pivotal, if C(I) ≤ V but
C(I\i) > V . In words, there would be no efficient trade without
the seller. Any time there is a pivotal seller, the VCG payments
to that seller allow her to extract all of the surplus, and the 
payments are too large to sustain with the buyer"s value unless this
is the only winning seller.
Concretely, we have this participation problem in the reverse
auction when the total payoff to the sellers, in equilibrium, 
exceeds the total payoff from the efficient allocation:
V − C(I) ≥
i
[V − C(I) − max(0, V − C(I \ i))]
As stated above, first notice that we require V > C(I \ i)
for all sellers i. In other words, there must be no pivotal sellers.
Given this, it is then necessary and sufficient that:
V − C(I) ≥
i
(C(I \ i) − C(I)) (1)
5
To make the reverse auction symmetric with the forward 
direction, we would need a buyer with a constant marginal-value to
buy the first M units, and zero value for additional units. The
payments to the sellers would never exceed the buyer"s value in
this case. Conversely, to make the forward auction symmetric
with the reverse auction, we would need a seller with a constant
(and high) marginal-cost to sell anything less than the first M
units, and then a low (or zero) marginal cost. The total payments
received by the seller can be less than the seller"s cost for the
outcome in this case.
168
In words, the surplus of the efficient allocation must be greater
than the total marginal-surplus provided by each seller.6
Consider an example with 3 agents {1, 2, 3}, and V = 150
and C(123) = 50. Condition (1) holds when C(12) = C(23) =
70 and C(13) = 100, but not when C(12) = C(23) = 80
and C(13) = 100. In the first case, the agent payoffs π =
(π0, π1, π2, π3), where 0 is the seller, is (10, 20, 50, 20). In the
second case, the payoffs are π = (−10, 30, 50, 30).
One thing we do know, because the VCG mechanism will
maximize the payoff to the buyer across all efficient mechanisms
[14], is that whenever Eq. 1 is not satisfied there can be no 
efficient auction mechanism.7
2.3 ε-Strategyproofness
We now consider the same VCG mechanism, but with an 
approximation scheme for the underlying allocation problem. We
derive an ε-strategyproofness result, that bounds the maximal
gain in payoff that an agent can expect to achieve through a 
unilateral deviation from following a simple truth-revealing strategy.
We describe the result for the forward auction direction, but it is
quite a general observation.
As before, let V (I) denote the value of the optimal solution
to the allocation problem with truthful bids from all agents, and
V (I \i) denote the value of the optimal solution computed 
without bids from agent i. Let ˆV (I) and ˆV (I \ i) denote the value
of the allocation computed with an approximation scheme, and
assume that the approximation satisfies:
(1 + ) ˆV (I) ≥ V (I)
for some > 0. We provide such an approximation scheme
for our setting later in the paper. Let ˆx denote the allocation
implemented by the approximation scheme.
The payoff to agent i, for announcing valuation ˆvi, is:
vi(ˆxi) +
j=i
ˆvj (ˆxj) − ˆV (I \ i)
The final term is independent of the agent"s announced value,
and can be ignored in an incentive-analysis. However, agent i
can try to improve its payoff through the effect of its announced
value on the allocation ˆx implemented by the mechanism. In 
particular, agent i wants the mechanism to select ˆx to maximize the
sum of its true value, vi(ˆxi), and the reported value of the other
agents,
Èj=i ˆvj (ˆxj). If the mechanism"s allocation algorithm is
optimal, then all the agent needs to do is truthfully state its value
and the mechanism will do the rest. However, faced with an 
approximate allocation algorithm, the agent can try to improve its
payoff by announcing a value that corrects for the 
approximation, and causes the approximation algorithm to implement the
allocation that exactly maximizes the total reported value of the
other agents together with its own actual value [18].
6
This condition is implied by the agents are substitutes 
requirement [3], that has received some attention in the combinatorial
auction literature because it characterizes the case in which VCG
payments can be supported in a competitive equilibrium. Useful
characterizations of conditions that satisfy agents are substitutes,
in terms of the underlying valuations of agents have proved quite
elusive.
7
Moreover, although there is a small literature on 
maximallyefficient mechanisms subject to requirements of 
voluntaryparticipation and budget-balance (i.e. with the mechanism 
neither introducing or removing money), analytic results are only
known for simple problems (e.g. [16, 4]).
We can now analyze the best possible gain from 
manipulation to an agent in our setting. We first assume that the other
agents are truthful, and then relax this. In both cases, the 
maximal benefit to agent i occurs when the initial approximation is
worst-case. With truthful reports from other agents, this occurs
when the value of choice ˆx is V (I)/(1 + ε). Then, an agent
could hope to receive an improved payoff of:
V (I) −
V (I)
1 + ε
=
ε
1 + ε
V (I)
This is possible if the agent is able to select a reported type to
correct the approximation algorithm, and make the algorithm 
implement the allocation with value V (I). Thus, if other agents are
truthful, and with a (1 + ε)-approximation scheme to the 
allocation problem, then no agent can improve its payoff by more than
a factor ε/(1 + ε) of the value of the optimal solution.
The analysis is very similar when the other agents are not
truthful. In this case, an individual agent can improve its 
payoff by no more than a factor /(1 + ) of the value of the optimal
solution given the values reported by the other agents.
Let V in the following theorem define the total value of the
efficient allocation, given the reported values of agents j = i,
and the true value of agent i.
THEOREM 1. A VCG-based mechanism with a (1 + 
ε)allocation algorithm is (1+
−V ) strategyproof for agent i, and
agent i can gain at most this payoff through some non-truthful
strategy.
Notice that we did not need to bound the error on the allocation
problems without each agent, because the -strategyproofness
result follows from the accuracy of the first-term in the VCG
payment and is independent of the accuracy of the second-term.
However, the accuracy of the solution to the problem without
each agent is important to implement a good approximation to
the revenue properties of the VCG mechanism.
