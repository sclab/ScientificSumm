Task allocation in multiagent systems has been 
investigated by many researchers in recent years with different 
assumptions and emphases. However, most of the research
to date on task allocation does not consider social 
connections among agents, and studies the problem in a centralized

setting. For example, Kraus et al. [12] develop an auction
protocol that enables agents to form coalitions with time
constraints. It assumes each agent knows the capabilities
of all others. The proposed protocol is centralized, where
one manager is responsible for allocating the tasks to all
coalitions. Manisterski at al. [14] discuss the possibilities of
achieving efficient allocations in both cooperative and 
noncooperative settings. They propose a centralized algorithm
to find the optimal solution. In contrast to this work, we
introduce also an efficient completely distributed protocol
that takes the social network into account.
Task allocation has also been studied in distributed 
settings by for example Shehory and Kraus [18] and by 
Lerman and Shehory [13]. They propose distributed algorithms
with low communication complexity for forming coalitions
in large-scale multiagent systems. However, they do not
assume the existence of any agent network. The work of
Sander et al. [16] introduces computational geometry-based
algorithms for distributed task allocation in geographical 
domains. Agents are then allowed to move and actively search
for tasks, and the capability of agents to perform tasks is 
homogeneous. In order to apply their approach, agents need
to have some knowledge about the geographical positions
of tasks and some other agents. Other work [17] proposes
a location mechanism for open multiagent systems to 
allocate tasks to unknown agents. In this approach each agent
caches a list of agents they know. The analysis of the 
communication complexity of this method is based on lattice-like
graphs, while we investigate how to efficiently solve task 
allocation in a social network, whose topology can be arbitrary.
Networks have been employed in the context of task 
allocation in some other works as well, for example to limit the

interactions between agents and mediators [1]. Mediators in
this context are agents who receive the task and have 
connections to other agents. They break up the task into subtasks,
and negotiate with other agents to obtain commitments to
execute these subtasks. Their focus is on modeling the 
decision process of just a single mediator. Another approach is
to partition the network into cliques of nodes, representing
coalitions which the agents involved may use as a 
coordination mechanism [20]. The focus of that work is distributed
coalition formation among agents, but in our approach, we
do not need agents to form groups before allocating tasks.
Easwaran and Pitt [6] study ‘complex tasks" that require
‘services" for their accomplishment. The problem concerns
the allocation of subtasks to service providers in a supply
chain. Another study of task allocation in supply chains
is [21], where it is argued that the defining characteristic
of Supply Chain Formation is hierarchical subtask 
decomposition (HSD). HSD is implemented using task dependency
networks (TDN), with agents and goods as nodes, and I/O
relations between them as edges. Here, the network is given,
and the problem is to select a subgraph, for which the 
authors propose a market-based algorithm, in particular, a 
series of auctions. Compared to these works, our approach is
more general in the sense that we are able to model different
types of connections or constraints among agents for 
different problem domains in addition to supply chain formation.
Finally, social networks have been used in the context of
team formation. Previous work has shown how to learn
which relations are more beneficial in the long run [8], and
adapt the social network accordingly. We believe these 
results can be transferred to the domain of task allocation as
well, leaving this as a topic for further study.
