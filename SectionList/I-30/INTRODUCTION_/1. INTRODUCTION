Recent years have seen a lot of work on task and 
resource allocation methods, which can potentially be applied
to many real-world applications. However, some interesting
applications where relations between agents play a role 
require a slightly more general model. Such situations appear
very frequently in real-world scenarios, and recent 
technological developments are bringing more of them within the
range of task allocation methods. Especially in business 
applications, preferential partner selection and interaction is
very common, and this aspect becomes more important for
task allocation research, to the extent that technological 
developments need to be able to support it.
For example, the development of semantic web and grid
technologies leads to increased and renewed attention for
the potential of the web to support business processes [7,
15]. As an example, virtual organizations (VOs) are 
being re-invented in the context of the grid, where they are
composed of a number of autonomous entities (representing
different individuals, departments and organizations), each
of which has a range of problem-solving capabilities and 
resources at its disposal [15, p. 237]. The question is how VOs
are to be dynamically composed and re-composed from 
individual agents, when different tasks and subtasks need to be
performed. This would be done by allocating them to 
different agents who may each be capable of performing different
subsets of those tasks. Similarly, supply chain formation
(SCF) is concerned with the, possibly ad-hoc, allocation of
services to providers in the supply chain, in such a way that
overall profit is optimized [6, 21].
Traditionally, such allocation decisions have been 
analyzed using transaction cost economics (TCE) [4], which
takes the transaction between consecutive stages of 
development as its basic unit of analysis, and considers the firm
and the market as alternative structural forms for 
organizing transactions. (Transaction cost) economics has 
traditionally built on analysis of comparative statics: the central
problem of economic organization is considered to be the
adaptation of organizational forms to the characteristics of
transactions. More recently, TCE"s founding father, Ronald
Coase, acknowledged that this is too simplistic an approach
[5, p. 245]: The analysis cannot be confined to what 
happens within a single firm. (. . . ) What we are dealing with
is a complex interrelated structure.
In this paper, we study the problem of task allocation
from the perspective of such a complex interrelated 
structure. In particular, â€˜the market" cannot be considered as an
organizational form without considering specific partners to
interact with on the market [11]. Specifically, therefore, we
consider agents to be connected to each other in a social
network. Furthermore, this network is not fully connected:
as informed by the business literature, firms typically have
established working relations with limited numbers of 
preferred partners [10]; these are the ones they consider when
new tasks arrive and they have to form supply chains to 
allocate those tasks [19]. Other than modeling the interrelated

structure between business partners, the social network 
introduced in this paper can also be used to represent other
types of connections or constraints among autonomous 
entities that arise from other application domains.
The next section gives a formal description of the task 
allocation problem on social networks. In Section 3, we prove
that the complexity of this problem remains NP-hard. We
then proceed to develop a distributed algorithm in Section 4,
and perform a series of experiments with this algorithm, as
described in Section 5. Section 6 discusses related work, and
Section 7 concludes.
