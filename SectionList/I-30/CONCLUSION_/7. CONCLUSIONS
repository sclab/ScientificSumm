In this paper we studied the task allocation problem in a
social network (STAP), which can be seen as a new, more
general, variant of the TAP. We believe it has a great amount
of potential for realistic problems. We provided complexity
results on computing the efficient solution for the STAP, as
well as a bound on possible approximation algorithms. Next,
we presented a distributed protocol, related to the 
contractnet protocol. We also introduced an exponential algorithm
to compute the optimal solution, as well as a fast 
upperbound algorithm. Finally, we used the optimal solution and
the upper-bound (for larger instances) to conduct an 
extensive set of experiments to assess the solution quality and
the computational efficiency of the proposed distributed 
algorithm in different types of networks, namely, small-world
networks, random networks, and scale-free networks.
The results presented in this paper show that the 
distributed algorithm performs well in small-world, scale-free,
and random networks, and for many different settings. Also
other experiments were done (e.g. on grid networks) and
these results held up over a wider range of scenarios. 
Furthermore, we showed that it scales well to large networks,
both in terms of quality and of required computation time.
The results also suggest that small-world networks are slightly
better suited for local task allocation, because there are no
nodes with very few neighbors.
There are many interesting extensions to our current work.
In this paper, we focus on the computational aspect in the
design of the distributed algorithm. In our future work, we
would also like to address some of the related issues in game
theory, such as strategic agents, and show desirable 
properties of a distributed protocol in such a context.
In the current algorithm we assume that agents can only
contact their neighbors to request resources, which may 
explain why our algorithm performs not as good in the 
scalefree networks as in the small-world networks. Our future
work may allow agents to reallocate (sub)tasks. We are 
interested in seeing how such interactions will affect the 
performance of task allocation in different social networks.
A third interesting topic for further work is the addition
of reputation information among the agents. This may help
to model changing business relations and incentivize agents
to follow the protocol.
Finally, it would be interesting to study real-life instances
of the social task allocation problem, and see how they 
relate to the randomly generated networks of different types
studied in this paper.
