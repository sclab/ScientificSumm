This paper proposed a conceptual approach to utilize 
domainspecific knowledge in an IR system to improve its effectiveness in
retrieving biomedical literature. We specified five different types
of domain-specific knowledge (i.e., synonyms, hyponyms,
hypernyms, lexical variants, and implicitly related concepts) and
examined their effects in performance contribution. We also
evaluated other two techniques, pseudo-feedback and abbreviation
correction. Experimental results have shown that appropriate use
of domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual IR model yields
significant improvements (23%) in passage retrieval over the best
known results. In our future work, we will explore the use of other
existing knowledge resources, such as UMLS and the Wikipedia,
and evaluate techniques such as disambiguation of gene symbols
for improving retrieval effectiveness. The application of our
conceptual IR model in other domains such as clinical medicine
will be investigated.
