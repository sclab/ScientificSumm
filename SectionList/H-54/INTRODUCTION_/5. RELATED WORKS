Many studies used manually-crafted thesauruses or knowledge
databases created by text mining systems to improve retrieval
effectiveness based on either word-statistical retrieval systems or
conceptual retrieval systems.
[11][1] assessed query expansion using the UMLS
Metathesaurus. Based on a word-statistical retrieval system, [11]
used definitions and different types of thesaurus relationships for
query expansion and a deteriorated performance was reported. [1]
expanded queries with phrases and UMLS concepts determined by
the MetaMap, a program which maps biomedical text to UMLS
concepts, and no significant improvement was shown. We used
MeSH, Entrez gene, and other non-thesaurus knowledge resources
such as an abbreviation database for query expansion. A critical
difference between our work and those in [11][1] is that our
retrieval model is based on concepts, not on individual words.
The Genomics track in TREC provides a common platform to
evaluate methods and techniques proposed by various groups for
biomedical information retrieval. As summarized in [8][9][10],
many groups utilized domain-specific knowledge to improve
retrieval effectiveness. Among these groups, [3] assessed both
thesaurus-based knowledge, such as gene information, and non
thesaurus-based knowledge, such as lexical variants of gene
symbols, for query expansion. They have shown that query
expansion with acronyms and lexical variants of gene symbols
produced the biggest improvement, whereas, the query expansion
with gene information from gene databases deteriorated the
performance. [21] used a similar approach for generating lexical
variants of gene symbols and reported significant improvements.
Our system utilized more types of domain-specific knowledge,
including hyponyms, hypernyms and implicitly related concepts.
In addition, under the conceptual retrieval framework, we
examined more comprehensively the effects of different types of
domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.
[20][15] utilized WordNet, a database of English words and
their lexical relationships developed by Princeton University, for
query expansion in the non-biomedical domain. In their studies,
queries were expanded using the lexical semantic relations such as
synonyms, hypernyms, or hyponyms. Little benefit has been
shown in [20]. This has been due to ambiguity of the query terms
which have different meanings in different contexts. When these
synonyms having multiple meanings are added to the query,
substantial irrelevant documents are retrieved. In the biomedical
domain, this kind of ambiguity of query terms is relatively less
frequent, because, although the abbreviations are highly
ambiguous, general biomedical concepts usually have only one
meaning in the thesaurus, such as UMLS, whereas a term in
WordNet usually have multiple meanings (represented as synsets
in WordNet). Besides, we have implemented a post-ranking step
to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations, which
will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the
abbreviation ambiguity. Besides, we have implemented a 
postranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of
abbreviations, which will hopefully decrease the negative impact
caused by the abbreviation ambiguity. The retrieval model in [15]
emphasized the similarity between a query and a document on the
phrase level assuming that phrases are more important than
individual words when retrieving documents. Although the
assumption is similar, our conceptual model is based on the
biomedical concepts, not phrases.
[13] presented a good study of the role of knowledge in the
document retrieval of clinical medicine. They have shown that
appropriate use of semantic knowledge in a conceptual retrieval
framework can yield substantial improvements. Although the
retrieval model is similar, we made a study in the domain of
genomics, in which the problem structure and task knowledge is
not as well-defined as in the domain of clinical medicine [18].
Also, our similarity function is very different from that in [13].
In summary, our approach differs from previous works in four
important ways: First, we present a case study of conceptual
retrieval in the domain of genomics, where many knowledge
resources can be used to improve the performance of biomedical
IR systems. Second, we have studied more types of 
domainspecific knowledge than previous researchers and carried out more
comprehensive experiments to look into the effects of different
types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.
Third, although some of the techniques seem similar to previously
published ones, they are actually quite different in details. For
example, in our pseudo-feedback process, we require that the unit
of feedback is a concept and the concept has to be of the same
semantic type as a query concept. This is to ensure that our
conceptual model of retrieval can be applied. As another example,
the way in which implicitly related concepts are extracted in this
paper is significantly different from that given in [19]. Finally, our
conceptual IR model is actually based on complex concepts
because some biomedical meanings, such as biological processes,
are represented by multiple simple concepts.
