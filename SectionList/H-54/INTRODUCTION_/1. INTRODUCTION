Biologists search for literature on a daily basis. For most
biologists, PubMed, an online service of U.S. National Library of
Medicine (NLM), is the most commonly used tool for searching
the biomedical literature. PubMed allows for keyword search by
using Boolean operators. For example, if one desires documents on
the use of the drug propanolol in the disease hypertension, a
typical PubMed query might be propanolol AND hypertension,
which will return all the documents having the two keywords.
Keyword search in PubMed is effective if the query is well-crafted
by the users using their expertise. However, information needs of
biologists, in some cases, are expressed as complex questions
[8][9], which PubMed is not designed to handle. While NLM does
maintain an experimental tool for free-text queries [6], it is still
based on PubMed keyword search.
The Genomics track of the 2006 Text REtrieval Conference
(TREC) provides a common platform to assess the methods and
techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information
retrieval. The queries were collected from real biologists and they
are expressed as complex questions, such as How do mutations in
the Huntingtin gene affect Huntington"s disease?. The document
collection contains 162,259 Highwire full-text documents in
HTML format. Systems from participating groups are expected to
find relevant passages within the full-text documents. A passage is
defined as any span of text that does not include the HTML
paragraph tag (i.e., <P> or </P>).
We approached the problem by utilizing domain-specific
knowledge in a conceptual retrieval model. Domain-specific
knowledge, in this paper, refers to information about concepts and
relationships between concepts in a certain domain. We assume
that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge might improve
the effectiveness of retrieval. For example, given a query What is
the role of gene PRNP in the Mad Cow Disease?, expanding the
gene symbol PRNP with its synonyms Prp, PrPSc, and
prion protein, more relevant documents might be retrieved.
PubMed and many other biomedical systems [8][9][10][13] also
make use of domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval
effectiveness.
Intuitively, retrieval on the level of concepts should outperform
bag-of-words approaches, since the semantic relationships
among words in a concept are utilized. In some recent studies
[13][15], positive results have been reported for this hypothesis. In
this paper, concepts are entry terms of the ontology Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH), a controlled vocabulary maintained by
NLM for indexing biomedical literature, or gene symbols in the
Entrez gene database also from NLM. A concept could be a word,
such as the gene symbol PRNP, or a phrase, such as Mad cow
diseases. In the conceptual retrieval model presented in this
paper, the similarity between a query and a document is measured
on both concept and word levels.
This paper makes two contributions:
1. We propose a conceptual approach to utilize domain-specific
knowledge in an IR system to improve its effectiveness in
retrieving biomedical literature. Based on this approach, our
system achieved significant improvement (23%) over the best
reported result in passage retrieval in the Genomics track of
TREC 2006.
2. We examine the effects of utilizing concepts and of different
types of domain-specific knowledge in performance
contribution.
This paper is organized as follows: problem statement is given in
the next section. The techniques are introduced in section 3. In
section 4, we present the experimental results. Related works are
given in section 5 and finally, we conclude the paper in section 6.
