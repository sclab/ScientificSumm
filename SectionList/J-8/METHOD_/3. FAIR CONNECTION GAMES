This section derives our results for fair connection games.
3.1 Existence of Strong Equilibrium
While it is known that every fair connection game 
possesses a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [2], this is not
necessarily the case for a strong equilibrium. In this section,
we study the existence of strong equilibrium in fair 
connection games. We begin with a simple case, showing that every
symmetric fair connection game possesses a strong 
equilibrium.
Theorem 3.1. In every symmetric fair connection game
there exists a strong equilibrium.
Proof. Let s be the source and t be the sink of all the
players. We show that a profile S in which all the players
choose the same shortest path Q (from the source s to the
sink t ) is a strong equilibrium. Suppose by contradiction
that S is not a SE. Then there is a coalition Γ that can
deviate to a new profile S such that the cost of every player
j ∈ Γ decreases. Let Qj be a new path used by player j ∈ Γ.
Since Q is a shortest path, it holds that c(Qj \ (Q ∩ Qj)) ≥
c(Q \ (Q ∩ Qj)), for any path Qj. Therefore for every player
j ∈ Γ we have that cj(S ) ≥ cj(S). However, this contradicts
the fact that all players in Γ reduce their cost. (In fact, no
player in Γ has reduced its cost.)
While every symmetric fair connection game admits a SE,
it does not hold for every fair connection game. In what 
follows, we study the network topologies that admit a strong
equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs, and give 
examples of topologies for which a strong equilibrium does not
exist. The following lemma, whose proof appears in the full
version, plays a major role in our proofs of the existence of
SE.
Lemma 3.2. Let Λ be a fair connection game on a series
parallel graph G with source s and sink t. Assume that player
i has si = s and ti = t and that Λ has some SE. Let S be
a SE that minimizes the cost of player i (out of all SE),
i.e., ci(S) = minT ∈SE(Λ) ci(T) and let S∗
be the profile that
minimizes the cost of player i (out of all possible profiles),
i.e., ci(S∗
) = minT ∈Σ ci(T). Then, ci(S) = ci(S∗
).
The next lemma considers parallel composition.
Lemma 3.3. Let Λ be a fair connection game on graph
G = G1||G2, where G1 and G2 are series parallel graphs. If
every fair connection game on the graphs G1 and G2 
possesses a strong equilibrium, then the game Λ possesses a
strong equilibrium.
Proof. Let G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) have sources
s1 and s2 and sinks t1 and t2, respectively. Let Ti be the
set of players with an endpoint in Vi \ {s, t}, for i ∈ {1, 2}.
(An endpoint is either a source or a sink of a player). Let
T3 be the set of players j such that sj = s and tj = t. Let
Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective graphs G1
and G2 with players T1 ∪ T3 and T2 ∪ T3, respectively.
Let S and S be the SE in Λ1 and Λ2 that minimizes
the cost of players in T3, respectively. Assume w.l.o.g. that
ci(S ) ≤ ci(S ) where player i ∈ T3. In addition, let Λ2 be
the game on the graph G2 with players T2 and let ¯S be a
SE in Λ2.
We will show that the profile S = S ∪ ¯S is a SE in Λ.
Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then, there
is a coalition Γ that can deviate such that the cost of every
player j ∈ Γ decreases. By Lemma 3.2 and the assumption
that ci(S ) ≤ ci(S ), a player j ∈ T3 cannot improve his
cost. Therefore, Γ ⊆ T1 ∪ T2. But this is a contradiction to
S being a SE in Λ1 or ¯S being a SE in Λ2.
The following theorem considers the case of single source
fair connection games.
Theorem 3.4. Every single source fair connection game
on a series-parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium.
Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on the 
network size |V |. The claim obviously holds if |V | = 2. We
show the claim for a series composition, i.e., G = G1 → G2,
and for a parallel composition, i.e., G = G1||G2, where
G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are SPG"s with sources
s1, s2, and sinks t1, t2, respectively.
series composition. Let G = G1 → G2. Let T1 be
the set of players j such that tj ∈ V1, and T2 be the set of
players j such that tj ∈ V2 \ {s2}.
Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective
graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T2 and T2, respectively.
For every player i ∈ T2 with action Si in the game Λ let
Si ∩E1 be his induced action in the game Λ1, and let Si ∩E2
be his induced action in the game Λ2.
Let S be a SE in Λ1 that minimizes the cost of players in
T2 (such a SE exists by the induction hypothesis and Lemma
3.2). Let S be any SE in Λ2. We will show that the profile
S = S ∪ S is a SE in the game Λ, i.e., for player j ∈ T2 we
use the profile Sj = Sj ∪ Sj .
Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then, there
is a coalition Γ that can deviate such that the cost of every
player j ∈ Γ decreases. Now, there are two cases:
Case 1: Γ ⊆ T1. This is a contradiction to S being a SE.
Case 2: There exists a player j ∈ Γ ∩ T2. By Lemma 3.2,
player j cannot improve his cost in Λ1 so the improvement
is due to Λ2. Consider the coalition Γ ∩ T2, it would still
improve its cost. However, this contradicts the fact that S
is a SE in Λ2.
parallel composition. Follows from Lemma 3.3.
While multi-commodity fair connection games on series
parallel graphs do not necessarily possess a SE (see 
Theorem 3.6), fair connection games on extension parallel graphs
always possess a strong equilibrium.
Theorem 3.5. Every fair connection game on an 
extension parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium.

Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on the 
network size |V |. Let Λ be a fair connection game on an EPG
G = (V, E). The claim obviously holds if |V | = 2. If the
graph G is a parallel composition of two EPG graphs G1
and G2, then the claim follows from Lemma 3.3. It remains
to prove the claim for extension composition. Suppose the
graph G is an extension composition of the graph G1 
consisting of a single edge e = (s1, t1) and an EPG G2 = (V2, E2)
with terminals s2, t2, such that s = s1 and t = t2. (The case
that G2 is a single edge is similar.)
Let T1 be the set of players with source s1 and sink t1
(i.e., their path is in G1). Let T2 be the set of players with
source and sink in G2. Let T3 be the set of players with
source s1 and sink in V2 \ t1.
Let Λ1 and Λ2 be the original game on the respective
graphs G1 and G2 with players T1 ∪ T3 and T2 ∪ T3, 
respectively. Let S , S be SE in Λ1 and Λ2 respectively. We will
show that the profile S = S ∪ S is a SE in the game Λ.
Suppose by contradiction that S is not a SE. Then, there is
a coalition Γ of minimal size that can deviate such that the
cost of any player j ∈ Γ decreases. Clearly, T1 ∩Γ = φ, since
players in T1 have a single strategy. Hence, Γ ⊆ T2 ∪T3. Any
player j ∈ T2 ∪T3 cannot improve his cost in Λ1. Therefore,
any player j ∈ T2 ∪ T3 improves his cost in Λ2. However,
this contradicts the fact that S is a SE in Λ2.
In the following theorem we provide a few examples of
topologies in which a strong equilibrium does not exist,
showing that our characterization is almost tight.
Theorem 3.6. The following connection games exist: (1)
There exists a multi-commodity fair connection game on a
series parallel graph that does not possess a strong 
equilibrium. (2) There exists a single source fair connection game
that does not possess a strong equilibrium.
Proof. For claim (1) consider the graph depicted in 
Figure 1(a). This game has a unique NE where S1 = {e, c},
S2 = {b, f}, and each player has a cost of 5.7
However, 
consider the following coordinated deviation S . S1 = {a, b, c},
7
In any NE of the game, player 1 will buy the edge e and
player 2 will buy the edge f. This is since the alternate
path, in the respective part, will cost the player 2.5. Thus,
player 1 (player 2) will buy the edge c (edge b) alone, and
each player will have a cost of 5.

and S2 = {b, c, d}. In this profile, each player pays a cost of
4, and thus improves its cost.
For claim (2) consider a single source fair connection game
on the graph G depicted in Figure 2. There are two players.
Player i = 1, 2 wishes to connect the source s to its sink ti
and the unique NE is S1 = {a, b}, S2 = {a, c}, and each
player has a cost of 2. 8
Then, both players can deviate to
S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, and decrease their costs
to 2 − /2.
Unfortunately, our characterization is not completely tight.
The graph in Figure 1(b) is an example of a non-extension
parallel graph which always admits a strong equilibrium.
3.2 Strong Price of Anarchy
While the price of anarchy in fair connection games can
be as bad as n, the following theorem shows that the strong
price of anarchy is bounded by H(n) = n
i=1
1
i
= Θ(log n).
Theorem 3.7. The strong price of anarchy of a fair 
connection game with n players is at most H(n).
Proof. Let Λ be a fair connection game on the graph G.
We denote by Λ(Γ) the game played on the graph G by a set
of players Γ, where the action of player i ∈ Γ remains Σi (the
same as in Λ). Let S = (S1, . . . , Sn) be a profile in the game
Λ. We denote by S(Γ) = SΓ the induced profile of players in
Γ in the game Λ(Γ). Let ne(S(Γ)) denote the load of edge
e under the profile S(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), i.e., ne(S(Γ)) =
|{j|j ∈ Γ, e ∈ Sj}|. Similar to congestion games [16, 13] we
denote by Φ(S(Γ)) the potential function of the profile S(Γ)
in the game Λ(Γ), where Φ(S(Γ)) = e∈E
ne(S(Γ))
j=1 fe(j),
and define Φ(S(φ)) = 0. In our case, it holds that
Φ(S) =
e∈E
ce · H(ne(S)). (1)
Let S be a SE, and let S∗
be the profile of the optimal
solution. We define an order on the players as follows. Let
Γn = {1, ..., n} be the set of all the players. For each k =
8
We can show that this is the unique NE by a simple case
analysis: (i) If S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player
1 can deviate to S1 = {h, g} and decrease his cost. (ii) If
S1 = {h, g} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player 2 can deviate to
S2 = {a, c} and decrease his cost. (iii) If S1 = {h, g} and
S2 = {a, c}, then player 1 can deviate to S1 = {a, b} and
decrease his cost.

n, . . . , 1, since S is a SE, there exists a player in Γk, w.l.o.g.
call it player k, such that,
ck(S) ≤ ck(S−Γk , S∗
Γk
). (2)
In this way, Γk is defined recursively, such that for every
k = n, . . . , 2 it holds that Γk−1 = Γk \ {k}. (I.e., after the
renaming, Γk = {1, . . . , k}.)
Let ck(S(Γk)) denote the cost of player k in the game
Λ(Γk) under the induced profile S(Γk). It is easy to see that
ck(S(Γk)) = Φ(S(Γk)) − Φ(S(Γk−1)).9
Therefore,
ck(S) ≤ ck(S−Γk , S∗
Γk
) (3)
≤ ck(S∗
(Γk)) = Φ(S∗
(Γk)) − Φ(S∗
(Γk−1)).
Summing over all players, we obtain:
i∈N
ci(S) ≤ Φ(S∗
(Γn)) − Φ(S∗
(φ))
= Φ(S∗
(Γn)) =
e∈S∗
ce · H(ne(S∗
))
≤
e∈S∗
ce · H(n) = H(n) · OPT(Λ),
where the first inequality follows since the sum of the right
hand side of equation (3) telescopes, and the second equality
follows from equation (1).
Next we bound the SPoA when coalitions of size at most
k are allowed.
Theorem 3.8. The k-SPoA of a fair connection game
with n players is at most n
k
· H(k).
Proof. Let S be a SE of Λ, and S∗
be the profile of the
optimal solution of Λ. To simplify the proof, we assume that
n/k is an integer. We partition the players to n/k groups
T1, . . . , Tn/k each of size k. Let Λj be the game on the
graph G played by the set of players Tj. Let S(Tj) denote
the profile of the k players in Tj in the game Λj induced by
the profile S of the game Λ. By Theorem 3.7, it holds that
for each game Λj, j = 1, . . . , n/k,
costΛj (S(Tj)) =
i∈Tj
ci(S(Tj))
≤ H(k) · OPT(Λj) ≤ H(k) · OPT(Λ).
Summing over all games Λj, j = 1, . . . , n/k,
costΛ(S) ≤
n/k
j=1
costΛj (S(Tj)) ≤
n
k
· H(k) · OPT(Λ),
where the first inequality follows since for each group Tj and
player i ∈ Tj, it holds that ci(S) ≤ ci(S(Tj)).
Next we show an almost matching lower bound. (The
lower bound is at most H(n) = O(log n) from the upper
bound and both for k = O(1) and k = Ω(n) the difference
is only a constant.)
Theorem 3.9. For fair connection games with n players,
k-SPoA ≥ max{n
k
, H(n)}.
9
This follows since for any strategy profile S, if a single
player k deviates to strategy Sk, then the change in the
potential value Φ(S) − Φ(Sk, S−k) is exactly the change in
the cost to player k.

Figure 3: Example of a network topology in which

Proof. For the lower bound of H(n) we observe that in
the example presented in [2], the unique Nash equilibrium
is also a strong equilibrium, and therefore k-SPoA = H(n)
for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n. For the lower bound of n/k, consider
a graph composed of two parallel links of costs 1 and n/k.
Consider the profile S in which all n players use the link
of cost n/k. The cost of each player is 1/k, while if any
coalition of size at most k deviates to the link of cost 1, the
cost of each player is at least 1/k. Therefore, the profile S
is a k-SE, and k-SPoA = n/k.
The results of Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 can be extended to
concave cost functions. Consider the extended fair 
connection game, where each edge has a cost which depends on the
number of players using that edge, ce(ne). We assume that
the cost function ce(ne) is a nondecreasing, concave 
function. Note that the cost of an edge ce(ne) might increase
with the number of players using it, but the cost per player
fe(ne) = ce(ne)/ne decreases when ce(ne) is concave.
Theorem 3.10. The strong price of anarchy of a fair 
connection game with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions
and n players is at most H(n).
Proof. The proof is analogues to the proof of 
Theorem 3.7. For the proof we show that cost(S) ≤ Φ(S∗
) ≤
H(n)·cost(S∗
). We first show the first inequality. Since the
function ce(x) is concave, the cost per player ce(x)/x is a
nonincreasing function. Therefore inequality (3) in the proof
of Theorem 3.7 holds. Summing inequality (3) over all 
players we obtain cost(S) = i ci(S) ≤ Φ(S∗
(Γn))−Φ(S∗
(φ)) =
Φ(S∗
). The second inequality follows since ce(x) is 
nondecreasing and therefore ne
x=1(ce(x)/x) ≤ H(ne) · ce(ne).
Using the arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.10 and
the proof of Theorem 3.8 we derive,
Theorem 3.11. The k-SPoA of a fair connection game
with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions and n players
is at most n
k
· H(k).
Since the set of strong equilibria is contained in the set of
Nash equilibria, it must hold that SPoA ≤ PoA, meaning
that the SPoA can only be improved compared to the PoA.
However, with respect to the price of stability the opposite
direction holds, that is, SPoS ≥ PoS. We next show that
there exists a fair connection game in which the inequality
is strict.

Theorem 3.12. There exists a fair connection game in
which SPoS > PoS.
Proof. Consider a single source fair connection game on
the graph G depicted in Figure 3.10
Player i = 1, . . . , n
wishes to connect the source s to his sink ti. Assume that
each player i = 1, . . . , n − 2 has his own path of cost 1/i
from s to ti and players i = n − 1, n have a joint path of
cost 2/n from s to ti. Additionally, all players can share a
common path of cost 1+ for some small > 0. The optimal
solution connects all players through the common path of
cost 1 + , and this is also a Nash equilibrium with total
cost 1 + . It is easy to verify that the solution where each
player i = 1, . . . , n−2 uses his own path and users i = n−1, n
use their joint path is the unique strong equilibrium of this
game with total cost n−2

While the example above shows that the SPoS may be
greater than the PoS, the upper bound of H(n) = Θ(log n),
proven for the PoS [2], serves as an upper bound for the
SPoS as well. This is a direct corollary from theorem 3.7, as
SPoS ≤ SPoA by definition.
Corollary 3.13. The strong price of stability of a fair
connection game with n players is at most H(n) = O(log n).
