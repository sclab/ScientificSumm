Computational game theory has introduced the issue of
incentives to many of the classical combinatorial 
optimization problems. The view that the demand side is many times
not under the control of a central authority that optimizes
the global performance, but rather under the control of 
individuals with different incentives, has led already to many
important insights.
Consider classical routing and transportation problems
such as multicast or multi-commodity problems, which are
many times viewed as follows. We are given a graph with
edge costs and connectivity demands between nodes, and
our goal is to find a minimal cost solution. The classical 
centralized approach assumes that all the individual demands
can both be completely coordinated and have no individual
incentives. The game theory point of view would assume
that each individual demand is controlled by a player that
optimizes its own utility, and the resulting outcome could
be far from the optimal solution.
When considering individual incentives one needs to 
discuss the appropriate solution concept. Much of the research
in computational game theory has focused on the classical
Nash equilibrium as the primary solution concept. Indeed
Nash equilibrium has many benefits, and most importantly
it always exists (in mixed strategies). However, the solution
concept of Nash equilibrium is resilient only to unilateral 
deviations, while in reality, players may be able to coordinate
their actions.
A strong equilibrium [4] is a state from which no coalition
(of any size) can deviate and improve the utility of every
member of the coalition (while possibly lowering the utility
84
of players outside the coalition). This resilience to 
deviations by coalitions of the players is highly attractive, and
one can hope that once a strong equilibrium is reached it is
highly likely to sustain. From a computational game theory
point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium
is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the
optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome
of selfish behavior. The strong price of anarchy (SPoA), 
introduced in [1], is the ratio between the cost of the worst
strong equilibrium and the cost of an optimal solution.
Obviously, SPoA is meaningful only in those cases where
a strong equilibrium exists. A major downside of strong
equilibrium is that most games do not admit any strong
equilibrium. Even simple classical games like the prisoner"s
dilemma do not posses any strong equilibrium (which is also
an example of a congestion game that does not posses a
strong equilibrium1
). This unfortunate fact has reduced the
concentration in strong equilibrium, despite its highly 
attractive properties. Yet, [1] have identified two broad 
families of games, namely job scheduling and network formation,
where a strong equilibrium always exists and the SPoA is
significantly lower than the price of anarchy (which is the
ratio between the worst Nash equilibrium and the optimal
solution [15, 18, 5, 6]).
In this work we concentrate on cost sharing connection
games, introduced by [3, 2]. In such a game, there is an
underlying directed graph with edge costs, and individual
users have connectivity demands (between a source and a
sink). We consider two models. The fair cost connection
model [2] allows each player to select a path from the source
to the sink2
. In this game the cost of an edge is shared
equally between all the players that selected the edge, and
the cost of the player is the sum of its costs on the edges it
selected. The general connection game [3] allows each player
to offer prices for edges. In this game an edge is bought if
the sum of the offers at least covers its cost, and the cost of
the player is the sum of its offers on the bought edges (in
both games we assume that the player has to guarantee the
connectivity between its source and sink).
In this work we focus on two important issues. The first
one is identifying under what conditions the existence of a
strong equilibrium is guaranteed, and the second one is the
quality of the strong equilibria. For the existence part, we
identify families of graph topologies that possess some strong
equilibrium for any assignment of edge costs. One can view
this separation between the graph topology and the edge
costs, as a separation between the underlying infrastructure
and the costs the players observe to purchase edges. While
one expects the infrastructure to be stable over long periods
of time, the costs the players observe can be easily modified
over short time periods. Such a topological characterization
of the underlying infrastructure provides a network designer
topological conditions that will ensure stability in his 
network.
Our results are as follows. For the single commodity case
(all the players have the same source and sink), there is a
strong equilibrium in any graph (both for fair and general
connection games). Moreover, the strong equilibrium is also
1
while any congestion game is known to admit at least one
Nash equilibrium in pure strategies [16].

The fair cost sharing scheme is also attractive from a 
mechanism design point of view, as it is a strategyproof 
costsharing mechanism [14].
the optimal solution (namely, the players share a shortest
path from the common source to the common sink). For
the case of a single source and multiple sinks (for 
example, in a multicast tree), we show that in a fair connection
game there is a strong equilibrium if the underlying graph
is a series parallel graph, and we show an example of a 
nonseries parallel graph that does not have a strong equilibrium.
For the case of multi-commodity (multi sources and sinks),
we show that in a fair connection game if the graph is an
extension parallel graph then there is always a strong 
equilibrium, and we show an example of a series parallel graph
that does not have a strong equilibrium. As far as we know,
we are the first to provide a topological characterization for
equilibrium existence in multi-commodity and single-source
network games.
For any fair connection game we show that if there exists
a strong equilibrium it is at most a factor of Θ(log n) from
the optimal solution, where n is the number of players. This
should be contrasted with the Θ(n) bound that exists for the
price of anarchy [2].
For single source general connection games, we show that
any series parallel graph possesses a strong equilibrium, and
we show an example of a graph that does not have a strong
equilibrium. In this case we also show that any strong 
equilibrium is optimal.

Topological characterizations for single-commodity network
games have been recently provided for various equilibrium
properties, including equilibrium existence [12, 7, 8], 
equilibrium uniqueness [10] and equilibrium efficiency [17, 11]. The
existence of pure Nash equilibrium in single-commodity 
network congestion games with player-specific costs or weights
was studied in [12]. The existence of strong equilibrium
was studied in both utility-decreasing (e.g., routing) and
utility-increasing (e.g., fair cost-sharing) congestion games.
[7, 8] have provided a full topological characterization for
a SE existence in single-commodity utility-decreasing 
congestion games, and showed that a SE always exists if and
only if the underlying graph is extension-parallel. [19] have
shown that in single-commodity utility-increasing 
congestion games, the topological characterization is essentially
equivalent to parallel links. In addition, they have shown
that these results hold for correlated strong equilibria as
well (in contrast to the decreasing setting, where correlated
strong equilibria might not exist at all). While the fair cost
sharing games we study are utility increasing network 
congestion games, we derive a different characterization than
[19] due to the different assumptions regarding the players"
actions.3
