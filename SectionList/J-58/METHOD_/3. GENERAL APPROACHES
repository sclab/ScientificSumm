3.1 Properties of Strategyproof Mechanisms
We discuss several properties that mechanisms need to satisfy in
order to be truthful.
THEOREM 1. If a mechanism M = (O, P) satisfies IC, then
∀i, if Oi(t|i
ti1 ) = Oi(t|i
ti2 ), then pi(t|i
ti1 ) = pi(t|i
ti2 ).
COROLLARY 2. For any strategy-proof mechanism for a binary
demand game G with setting S, if we fix the cost c−i of all agents
other than i, the payment to agent i is a constant p1
i if Oi(c) = 1,
and it is another constant p0
i if Oi(c) = 0.
THEOREM 3. Fixed the setting S for a binary demand game,
if mechanism M = (O, P) satisfies IC, then mechanism M =
(O, P ) with the same output method O and pi(c) = pi(c) −
δi(c−i) for any function δi(c−i) also satisfies IC.
The proofs of above theorems are straightforward and thus 
omitted due to space limit. This theorem implies that for the binary
demand games we can always normalize the payment to an agent
i such that the payment to the agent is 0 when it is not selected.
Hereafter, we will only consider normalized payment schemes.

3.2 Existence of Strategyproof Mechanisms
Notice, given the setting S, a mechanism design problem is 
composed of two parts: the allocation rule O and a payment scheme P.
In this paper, given an allocation rule O we focus our attention
on how to design a truthful payment scheme based on O. Given
an allocation rule O for a binary demand game, we first present
a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a truthful
payment scheme P.
DEFINITION 1 (MONOTONE NON-INCREASING PROPERTY (MP)).
An output method O is said to satisfy the monotone non-increasing
property if for every agent i and two of its possible costs ci1 < ci2 ,
Oi(c|i
ci2 ) ≤ Oi(c|i
ci1 ).
This definition is not restricted only to binary demand games.
For binary demand games, this definition implies that if Oi(c|i
ci2 ) =
1 then Oi(c|i
ci1 ) = 1.
THEOREM 4. Fix the setting S, c−i in a binary demand game
G with the allocation rule O, the following three conditions are
equivalent:
1. There exists a value κi(O, c−i)(which we will call a cut value,
such that Oi(c) = 1 if ci < κi(O, c−i) and Oi(c) = 0 if
ci > κi(O, c−i). When ci = κi(O, c−i), Oi(c) can be 
either 0 or 1 depending on the tie-breaker of the allocation rule
O. Hereafter, we will not consider the tie-breaker scenario
in our proofs.
2. The allocation rule O satisfies MP.
3. There exists a truthful payment scheme P for this binary 
demand game.
PROOF. The proof that Condition 2 implies Condition is 
straightforward and is omitted here.
We then show Condition 3 implies Condition 2. The proof of
this is similar to a proof in [13]. To prove this direction, we assume
there exists an agent i and two valuation vectors c|i
ci1 and c|i
ci2 ,
where ci1 < ci2 , Oi(c|i
ci2 ) = 1 and Oi(c|i
ci1 ) = 0. From
corollary 2, we know that pi(c|i
ci1 ) = p0
i and pi(c|i
ci2 ) = p1
i .
Now fix c−i, the utility for i when ci = ci1 is ui(ci1 ) = p0
i .
When agent i lies its valuation to ci2 , its utility is p1
i − ci1 . Since
M = (O, P) is truthful, we have p0
i > p1
i − ci1 .
Now consider the scenario when the actual valuation of agent i
is ci = ci2 . Its utility is p1
i − ci2 when it reports its true valuation.
Similarly, if it lies its valuation to ci1 , its utility is p0
i . Since M =
(O, P) is truthful, we have p0
i < p1
i − ci2 .
Consequently, we have p1
i −ci2 > p0
i > p1
i −ci1 . This inequality
implies that ci1 > ci2 , which is a contradiction.
We then show Condition 1 implies Condition 3. We prove this
by constructing a payment scheme and proving that this payment
scheme is truthful. The payment scheme is: If Oi(c) = 1, then
agent i gets payment pi(c) = κi(O, c−i); else it gets payment
pi(c) = 0.
From condition 1, if Oi(c) = 1 then ci > κi(O, c−i). Thus,
its utility is κi(O, c−i) − ci > 0, which implies that the payment
scheme satisfies the IR. In the following we prove that this payment
scheme also satisfies IC property. There are two cases here.
Case 1: ci < κ(O, c−i). In this case, when i declares its true
cost ci, its utility is κi(O, c−i) − ci > 0. Now consider the 
situation when i declares a cost di = ci. If di < κi(O, c−i), then
i gets the same payment and utility since it is still selected. If
di > κi(O, c−i), then its utility becomes 0 since it is not selected
anymore. Thus, it has no incentive to lie in this case.
Case 2: ci ≥ κ(O, c−i). In this case, when i reveals its true
valuation, its payment is 0 and the utility is 0. Now consider the
situation when i declares a valuation di = ci. If di > κi(O, c−i),
then i gets the same payment and utility since it is still not selected.
If di ≤ κi(O, c−i), then its utility becomes κi(O, c−i) − ci ≤ 0
since it is selected now. Thus, it has no incentive to lie.
The equivalence of the monotonicity property of the allocation
rule O and the existence of a truthful mechanism using O can be
extended to games beyond binary demand games. The details are
omitted here due to space limit. We now summarize the process to
design a truthful payment scheme for a binary demand game based
on an output method O.
General Framework 1 Truthful mechanism design for a binary
demand game
Stage 1: Check whether the allocation rule O satisfies MP. If it
does not, then there is no payment scheme P such that mechanism
M = (O, P) is truthful. Otherwise, define the payment scheme P
as follows.
Stage 2: Based on the allocation rule O, find the cut value
κi(O, c−i) for agent i such that Oi(c|i
di) = 1 when di <
κi(O, c−i), and Oi(c|i
di) = 0 when di > κi(O, c−i).
Stage 3: The payment for agent i is 0 if Oi(c) = 0; the payment is
κi(O, c−i) if Oi(c) = 1.
THEOREM 5. The payment defined by our general framework
is minimum among all truthful payment schemes using O as output.
