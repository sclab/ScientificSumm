Algorithm 1 is an efficient learning algorithm in the sense
that it finds a hypothesis with sample error zero in time
polynomial in the number of observations. As we have seen
in section 4 the number of observations required to PAC
learn the demand depends on the fat shattering dimension of
the class of demand functions which in turn depends on the
class of utility functions they are derived from. We compute
the fat shattering dimension for two classes of demands. The
first is the class of all demand functions, we show that this
class has infinite shattering dimension (we give two proofs)
and is therefore not PAC learnable. The second class we 
consider is the class of demand functions derived from utilities
with bounded support and income-Lipschitz. We show that
the class has a finite fat shattering dimension that depends
on the support and the income-Lipschitz constant.
Theorem 5. Let C be a set of demand functions from Rd
+
to Rd
+ then
fatC(γ) = ∞
Proof 1: For ε > 0 let pi = 2−i
p for i = 1, . . . , n be
a set of price vectors inducing parallel budget sets Bi and
let x1, . . . , xn be the intersection of these hyperplanes with
an orthogonal line passing through the center. Let H0 and
H1 be hyperplanes that are not parallel to p and let xi ∈
Bi ∩ (xi + H+
0 ) and xi ∈ Bi ∩ (xi + H−
1 ) for i = 1 . . . n (see
figure 1).
For any labeling b = (b1, . . . , bn) ∈ {0, 1}n
let y = y(b) =
(y1, . . . , yn) be a set of demands such that yi = xi if bi = 0
and yi = xi if bi = 1 (we omit an additional index b in
y for notational convenience). To show that p1, . . . , pn is
shattered it suffices to find for every b a demand function
fb supported by concave utility such that fb(pi) = yb
i . To
show that such a function exists it suffices to show that
Afriat"s conditions are satisfied. Since yi are in the budget
40
set yi · 2−i
p = 1, therefore pi · (yj − yi) = 2j−i
− 1. This
shows that pi · (yj − yi) ≤ 0 iff j < i hence there can be no
negative cycles and the condition is met. ✷
Proof 2: The utility functions satisfying Afriat"s condition
in the first proof could be trivial assigning the same utility
to xi as to xi . In fact, pick a utility function whose level
sets are parallel to the budget constraint. Therefore the
shattering of the prices p1, . . . , pn is the result of indifference
rather than genuine preference. To avoid this problem we
reprove the theorem by constructing utility functions u such
that u(xi) = u(xi ) for all i and therefore a distinct utility
function is associated with each labeling.
For i = 1, . . . n let pi1, . . . , pid be price vectors satisfying
the following conditions:
1. the budget sets Bs
i are supporting hyperplanes of a
convex polytope Λi
2. yi is a vertex of Λi
3. ||yj ||1 · ||pis − pi||∞ = o(1) for s = 1, . . . d and j =
1, . . . , n
Finally let yi1, . . . , yid be points on the facets of Λi that
intersect yi, such that ||pjr||1 · ||yi − yis||∞ = o(1) for all j,
s and r. We call the set of points yi, yi1, . . . , yid the level i
demand and pi, pi1, . . . , pid level i prices. Applying H¨olders
inequality we get
|pir · yjs − pi · yj | ≤ |(pir − pi) · yj| + |pir · (yjs − yj)|
||pir − pi||∞ · ||yj ||1 + ||yjs − yj||∞ · ||pir||1.
= o(1)
This shows that
pir · (yjs − yir) = pi · (ys − yi) + o(1) = 2j−i
− 1 + o(1)
therefore pir · (yjs − yir) ≤ 0 iff j < i or i = j. This implies
that if there is a negative cycle then all the points in the
cycle must belong to the same level. The points of any one
level lie on the facets of a polytope Λi and the prices pis are
supporting hyperplanes of the polytope. Thus, the polytope
defines a utility function for which these demands are utility
maximizing. The other direction of Afriat"s theorem 
therefore implies there can be no negative cycles within points on
the same level.
It follows that there are no negative cycles for the union
of observations from all levels hence the sequence of 
observations (y1, p1), (y11, p11), (y12, p12), . . . , (ynd, pnd) is 
consistent with monotone concave utility function maximization
and again by Afriat"s theorem there exists u supporting a
demand function fb ✷
The proof above relies on the fact that an agent have high
utility and marginal utility for very large bundles. In many
cases it is reasonable to assume that the marginal for very
large bundles is very small, or even that the utility or the
marginal utility have compact support. Unfortunately, 
rescaling the previous example shows that even a compact set
may contain a large shattered set. We notice however, that
in this case we obtain a utility function that yield demand
functions that are very sensitive to small price changes. We
show that the class of utility functions that have marginal
utilities with compact support and for which the relevant 
demand functions are income-Lipschitzian has finite fat 
shattering dimension.
