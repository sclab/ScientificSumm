This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of
the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market. Many avenues
for future work present themselves, including the following:
• Random walk conjecture. The most important
question mark in my mind is whether the random walk
assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market
efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects
the practicality of the system.
• Incentive analysis. Formally, what are the 
incentives for traders to act on new information and when?
How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader 
incentives?
• Laboratory experiments and field tests. This 
paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics
of the mechanism. However, the true test of the 
mechanism"s ability to serve as an instrument for hedging,
wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with
real traders in a realistic environment. In reality, how
do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism?
• DPM call market. I have derived the price functions
to react to wagers on one outcome at a time. The
mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on
both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather
than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers.
• Real-valued variables. I believe the mechanisms in
this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete
178
outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that 
always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple 
percentage values that must sum to 100). However, the
generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary
range is less clear, and open for future development.
• Compound/combinatorial betting. I believe that
DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or 
combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons
that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the
task. DPM may also have some computational 
advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.
