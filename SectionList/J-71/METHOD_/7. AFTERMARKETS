A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel
market is the ability to cash out of the market before it
closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss. This is 
accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the
same queue as the market maker. So traders can sell the
shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the
market maker. Or traders can place a limit sell order at any
price. Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at
the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the
market maker.
7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II
For the second main case explored above, where all money
177
is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple. In fact,
aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling
are both fully integrated into the same mechanism. Every
share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can 
simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker
in order to sell their shares. New buyers will accept the 
lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or
another trader. In this way, traders can cash out early and
walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they
can find a willing buyer.
7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I
When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers
are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different
amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not
as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket. However, an
aftermarket is still possible. In fact, much of the complexity
can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as
placing a sell order on the queue.
In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A
is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of
p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p
is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function
equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise. One can 
imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell
these two respective components. However, it is possible to
automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling
them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the
central DPM. In this way, traders can cash out by placing
sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker,
effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two
separate aftermarkets. The bundling mechanism works as
follows. Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1. A
buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1. The buyer pays
p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars. If there is
enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyer"s share is
constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first 
aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket. The seller
in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the
seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars.
7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I
There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket that"s 
possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.
Consider a share of A purchased for $5. The share is 
composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A. Now suppose the current price
has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to
cash out at a profit. The trader can sell 1/2 share at market
price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 
investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A. The 1/2 share is
worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending
on the outcome and the final payoff. So the trader is left
with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or
her initial investment. The trader has essentially cashed out
and locked in his or her gains. Now suppose instead that
the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share. The
trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for
$2. The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyer"s price
refunded). The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains
of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A. The trader"s loss
is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5. If A occurs, the
trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.
Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can
always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without
the need for any type of aftermarket.
