A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1
and p2 = αM2, where α > 0. In this case, prices would only
go up. For the case of all money being redistributed, this
would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on
the correct outcome. Even though the market maker"s price
only rises, the going price may fall well below the market
maker"s price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.
I have derived price functions for several other cases, using
the same methodology above. Each price function may have
its own desirable properties, but it"s not clear which is best,
or even that a single best method exists. Further analyses
and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required
to answer these questions.
