Above we examined the policy of refunding winning 
wagers and redistributing only losing wagers. In this section
we consider the second policy mentioned in Section 3.3: all
money from all wagers are collected and redistributed to
winning wagers.
For the case where all money is redistributed, the 
respective payoffs per share are:
P1 =
M1 + M2
N1
=
T
N1
P2 =
M1 + M2
N2
=
T
N2
,
where T = M1 + M2 is the total amount of money wagered
on both sides. So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their
initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned;
shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered. Similarly,
if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid,
but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A
lose all money wagered.
In this case, the trader"s per-share expected value for 
purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is
E[ shares]
= Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1. (13)
A risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of
shares n ≥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize
E[n shares] = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] −
Z n
0
p1(n)dn
= Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − m (14)
The same value of n can be solved for by finding the number
of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is,
find n ≥ 0 satisfying
0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1(n),
if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0.
5.1 Market probability
In this case MPr(A), the aggregate probability of A as
judged by the market as a whole, is the solution to
0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1.
Solving we get
MPr(A) =
p1
E[P1|A]
. (15)
As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that
the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff
per share. The assumption is critical for our analysis, but
may not be required for a practical implementation.
5.2 Price functions
For the case where all money is distributed, the 
constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B,
and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent
price function.
A reasonable price function can be derived from the 
constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that
the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.
That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2. In other words, the price of A is
proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and
similarly for B.

Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied
market probability:
M1
M2

p1
p2

MPr(A)
MPr(B)

T

N2
T
=
MPr(A)
MPr(B)
·

N1
MPr(A)
MPr(B)
=
M1N1
M2N2
MPr(A) =
M1N1
M1N1 + M2N2
(16)
Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in
Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with
the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and
vice versa.
The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal 
quantity of shares is:
p1 =
(M1)2
+ M1M2
M1N1 + M2N2
=
M1 + M2
N1 + M2
M1
N2
Working from the above instantaneous price, we can 
derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m
dollars, as follows:
dm
dn
=
M1 + M2 + m
N1 + n + M2
M1+m
N2
dn
dm
=
N1 + n + M2
M1+m
N2
M1 + M2 + m
(17)
· · ·
n =
m(N1 − N2)
T
+
N2(T + m)
M2
ln
»
T(M1 + m)
M1(T + m)

.
Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n). I could not
find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the
two other cases above. Still, n(m) can be used to determine
how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the
inverse function can be approximated to any degree 
numerically. From n(m) we can also compute the price function:
p1(m) =
dm
dn
=
(M1 + m)M2T
denom
, (18)
where
denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2
+T(M1 + m)N2 ln
»
T(M1 + m)
M1(T + m)

Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses
the above price function, then the market dynamics will be
such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B
always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and
B.
This price function has another desirable property: it acts
such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and 
simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3). That
is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0. The derivation is omitted.
5.3 Comparing DPM I and II
The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM
I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed
to at least break even. The main disadvantage of 
refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each
share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct
parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A
occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share
of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs. This complicates the
implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market
early, which we will examine below in Section 7. When all
money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous:
each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final
payoff. Because shares are homogenous, the 
implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in
Section 7. On the other hand, because initial prices paid
are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if
prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome
might actually lose money. Traders must be aware that if
they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles
allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they
may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome. From
informal experiments, I don"t believe this eventuality would
be common, but nonetheless it requires care in 
communicating to traders the possible risks. One potential fix would be
for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going
too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome. At
this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering
the price. Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in
below the market maker"s price, but in this way the system
could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at
least breaks even.
