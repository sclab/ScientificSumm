A framework for QoS-based service discovery in grids has been
proposed in [18]. UDDIe, an extended UDDI registry for
publishing and discovering services based on QoS parameters, is
proposed in [19]. Our work is complementary since we focus on
how to federate the UDDI registries and address the scalability
issue with UDDI. The DUDE proxy can publish the service
properties supported by UDDIe in the DHT and support range
queries using techniques proposed for such queries on DHTs.
Then we can deliver the scalability benefits of our current solution
to both UDDI and UDDIe registries. Discovering services meeting
QoS and price requirements has been studied in the context of a
grid economy, so that grid schedulers can use various market
models such as commodity markets and auctions. The Grid
Market Directory [20] was proposed for this purpose.
In [12], the authors present an ontology-based matchmaker.
Resource and request descriptions are expressed in RDF Schema,
a semantic markup language. Matchmaking rules are expressed in
TRIPLE, a language based on Horn Logic. Although our current
implementation focuses on UDDI version 2, in future we will
consider semantic extensions to UDDI, WS-Discovery [16] and
other Grid computing standards such as Monitoring and
Discovery Service (MDS) [10]. So the simplest extension of our
work could involve using the DHT to do an initial syntax-based
search to identify the local registries that need to be contacted.
Then the Proxy Registry can contact these registries, which do
semantic matchmaking to identify their matches, which are then
merged at the Proxy Registry and returned to the client.
The convergence of grid and P2P computing has been explored in
[5]. GridVine [2] builds a logical semantic overlay on top of a
physical layer consisting of P-Grid [1], a structured overlay based
on distributed search tree that uses prefix-based routing and
changes the overlay paths as part of the network maintenance
protocol to adapt to load in different parts of the keyspace. A
federated UDDI service [4] has been built on top of the PlanetP
[3] publish-subscribe system for unstructured P2P communities.
The focus of this work has been on the manageability of the
federated service. The UDDI service is treated as an application
Article 2
service to be managed in their framework. So they do not address
the issue of scalability in UDDI, and instead use simple
replication. In [21], the authors describe a UDDI extension (UX)
system that launches a federated query only if locally found
results are not adequate. While the UX Server is positioned as an
intermediary similarly to the UDDI Proxy described in our DUDE
framework, it focuses more on the QoS framework and does not
attempt to implement a seamless federation mechanism such as
our DHT based approach. In [22] D2HT describes a discovery
framework built on top of DHT. However, we have chosen to use
UDDI on top of DHT. D2HT have used (Agent Management
System) AMS/ (Directory Facilitator) DF on top of DHT.
