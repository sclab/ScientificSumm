In this paper, we have described a distributed architecture to
support large scale discovery of web-services. Our architecture
will enable organizations to maintain autonomous control over
their UDDI registries and at the same time allowing clients to
query multiple registries simultaneously. The clients are oblivious
to the transparent proxy approach we have adopted and get richer
and more complete response to their queries. Based on initial
prototype testing, we believe that DUDE architecture can support
effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI
more robust and also addressing its scaling issues. The paper has
solved the scalability issues with UDDI but does not preclude the
application of this approach to other service discovery
mechanisms. An example of another service discovery mechanism
that could benefit from such an approach is Globus Toolkit"s
MDS. Furthermore, we plan to investigate other aspects of grid
service discovery that extend this work. Some of these aspects
include the ability to subscribe to resource/service information,
the ability to maintain soft states and the ability to provide a
variety of views for various different purposes. In addition, we
plan to revisit the service APIs for a Grid Service Discovery
solution leveraging the available solutions and specifications as
well as the work presented in this paper.
