Wireless data dissemination is an economical and efficient
way to make desired data available to a large number of mobile or
static users. The mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric,
that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream
communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is
significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server
(upstream communication). The effectiveness of a data
dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the
required data at anywhere and at anytime. One of the best ways to
accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly
personalized Location Based Services (LBS) which allows users
to access personalized location dependent data. An example
would be someone using their mobile device to search for a
vegetarian restaurant. The LBS application would interact with
other location technology components or use the mobile user's
input to determine the user's location and download the
information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by
tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating LDD.
We see a limited deployment of LBS by some service
providers. But there are every indications that with time some of
the complex technical problems such as uniform location
framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of
places, positioning in various environments, innovative location
applications, etc., will be resolved and LBS will become a
common facility and will help to improve market productivity and
customer comfort. In our project called DAYS, we use wireless
data broadcast mechanism to push LDD to users and mobile users
monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required
data. A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant
performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices
and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air
indexing. The indexing approach stores control information which
tells the user about the data location in the broadcast and how and
when he could access it. A mobile user, thus, has some free time
to go into the doze mode which conserves valuable power. It also
allows the user to personalize his own mobile device by
selectively tuning to the information of his choice.
Access efficiency and energy conservation are the two issues
which are significant for data broadcast systems. Access efficiency
refers to the latency experienced when a request is initiated till the
response is received. Energy conservation [7, 10] refers to the
efficient use of the limited energy of the mobile device in
accessing broadcast data. Two parameters that affect these are the
tuning time and the access latency. Tuning time refers to the time
during which the mobile unit (MU) remains in active state to tune
the channel and download its required data. It can also be defined
as the number of buckets tuned by the mobile device in active
state to get its required data. Access latency may be defined as the
time elapsed since a request has been issued till the response has
been received.

Several indexing schemes have been proposed in the past and
the prominent among them are the tree based and the exponential
indexing schemes [17]. The main disadvantages of the tree based
schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures. To
start a search, the MU has to wait until it reaches the root of the
next broadcast tree. This significantly affects the tuning time of
the mobile unit. The exponential schemes facilitate index
replication by sharing links in different search trees. For
broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme
has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in
terms of access latency. Also, the average length of broadcast
increases due to the index replication and this may cause
significant increase in the access latency. None of the above
indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location
dependent data. In addition to providing low latency, they lack
properties which are used to address LDD issues. We propose an
indexing scheme in DAYS which takes care of some these
problems. We show with simulation results that our scheme
outperforms some of the earlier indexing schemes for
broadcasting LDD in terms of tuning time.
The rest of the paper is presented as follows. In section 2, we
discuss previous work related to indexing of broadcast data.
Section 3 describes our DAYS architecture. Location dependent
data, its generation and subsequent broadcast is presented in
section 4. Section 5 discusses our indexing scheme in detail.
Simulation of our scheme and its performance evaluation is
presented in section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper and
mentions future related work.
