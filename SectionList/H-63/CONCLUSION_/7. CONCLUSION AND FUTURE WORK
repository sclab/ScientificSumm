In this paper we have presented a scheme for mapping of wireless
broadcast data with their locations. We have presented an example
to show how the hierarchical structure of the location tree maps
with the data to create LDD. We have presented a scheme called
LBIS to index this LDD. We have used the containment property
of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of
data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.
The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will
be used in our DAYS project to create the push based
architecture. The LBIS has been compared with two other
prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing
scheme and the exponential indexing scheme. We showed in our
simulations that the LBIS scheme has the lowest tuning time for
broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable
battery power in the MU.

In the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in
our DAYS project. Data from the server is available for access by
the global users. This may be done by putting a request to the
source server. The query in this case is a global query. It is
transferred from the user"s source server to the destination server
through the use of LEO satellites. We intend to use our LDD
scheme and data staging architecture in the pull based architecture.
We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging
architecture significantly improves the latency for global as well as
local query.
