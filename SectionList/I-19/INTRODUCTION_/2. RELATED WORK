Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be 
segmented along two broad lines. On the one hand, there is the
game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of 
simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium
strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11]. Such 
analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in
the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M 
Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions). On the other hand,
heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex
settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or
the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed 
auctions [1, 13, 5]. This paper adopts the former approach in
studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since
this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.
In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans
and Weber provides one of the starting points for the 
gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have
substitutable goods. Their work analyses a market 
consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for
a dresser. Thus, the couple"s bid space can at most contain
two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two
geographically distributed auctions simultaneously. They 
derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case
where the number of buyers is large. Our analysis differs
from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which
bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can
bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible
given autonomous agents).
Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous
auctions with complementary goods. They analyse the case
of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding
of the buyers and resultant market efficiency. The setting
provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common
values in [9]. However, neither of these works extend easily to
the case of substitutable goods which we consider. This case
is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted
to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder
having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of
other bidders). The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium
strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result
is more general. Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent
English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for
buyers with different risk attitudes. However, he forces the
bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this
paper not always to be optimal.
