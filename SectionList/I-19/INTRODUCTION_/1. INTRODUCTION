The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted
in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or
even identical goods and services [9, 10]. In eBay alone, for
example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even 
thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such
substitutable items1
. Against this background, it is essential
to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use
to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions. To
this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal 
bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting
- namely, an agent that participates in multiple, 
concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that
are perfect substitutes. As we will show, however, this 
analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are
conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.
To date, much of the existing literature on multiple 
auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on 
simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of
items together is greater than the sum of the individual items
(see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).
In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets
with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.
In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed
bid auctions. We choose these because they require little
communication and are well known for their capacity to 
induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many
multi-agent system settings. However, our results generalise
to settings with English auctions since these are strategically
equivalent to second-price auctions. Within this setting, we
are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidder"s 
utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any 
number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation 
distribution. In more detail, we first consider a market where a
single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number
of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local 
bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction. For this
case, we find the following results:
• Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a
bidder"s best strategy is to bid its true value, the best
strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it.
• We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder 
requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised
by participating in all the auctions that are selling the
desired item.
• Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an 
arduous task when considering all possible combinations.
However, for most common bidder valuation 
distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search
space and thus the computation required.
• Empirically, we find that a bidder"s expected utility
is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the
auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.
We then go on to consider markets with more than one global
bidder. Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine
analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to 
numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy. By so doing,
we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the 
dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure 
strategy. In fact it fluctuates between two states. If the market
consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global
bidders" strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we
approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. 
Section 2 discusses related work. In Section 3 we describe the
bidders and the auctions in more detail. In Section 4 we 
investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise
the optimal bidding behaviour for it. Section 5 considers the
case with multiple global bidders and in Section 6 we address
the market efficiency. Finally, Section 7 concludes.
