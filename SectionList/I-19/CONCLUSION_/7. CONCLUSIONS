In this paper, we derive utility-maximising strategies for 
bidding in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions. We
first analyse the case where a single global bidder bids in
all auctions, whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a
single auction. For this setting, we find the counter-intuitive
result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions
that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires
a single item and derives no additional benefit from having
more. Thus, a potential buyer can achieve considerable 
benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an
optimal bidding strategy. For a number of common 
valuation distributions, we show analytically that the problem of
finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions. This 
considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can
thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any
number of auctions.
Furthermore, we investigate a setting with multiple global
bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation
approach. We find that a global bidder"s strategy does not
stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market,
but only converges when there are local bidders as well. We
argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain
both local and global bidders. The converged results are then
very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we
find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple
auctions. For the more complex setting with multiple global
bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids
for specific cases.
Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with 
multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder. We
show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of
local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.
In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency 
significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due
to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more
than two items. These results show that the way in which
the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global
bidder depends on the information that is available to that
global bidder.
In future work, we intend to extend the results to imperfect
substitutes (i.e., when a global bidder gains from winning
additional items), and to settings where the auctions are no
longer identical. The latter arises, for example, when the
number of (average) local bidders differs per auction or the
auctions have different settings for parameters such as the
reserve price.
