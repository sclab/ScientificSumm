The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an
auctioneer. Each seller auctions one item; these items are
complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value
and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more
than one item). The M auctions are executed concurrently;
that is, they end simultaneously and no information about
the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until
the bids are placed2
. However, we briefly address markets
with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.
We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a
bidder does not prefer one auction over another). Finally, we
assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs
no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk
neutral bidders.
3.1 The Auctions
The seller"s auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction,
where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest
price. This format has several advantages for an agent-based
setting. Firstly, it is communication efficient. Secondly, for
the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in
at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true
value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation
of the item is known). This strategy is also weakly dominant
(i.e., it is independent of the other bidders" decisions), and
therefore it requires no information about the preferences of
other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations).
3.2 Global and Local Bidders
We distinguish between global and local bidders. The former
can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid
in a single one. Local bidders are assumed to bid according to
the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3
.
We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and
dynamic. In the first model, the number of local bidders
is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.
In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number
of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown
and may vary for each auction. This uncertainty is modelled
using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in
Section 4.1).
As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally
has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even
though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only
requires one of them. However, we can identify a number of
compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid
globally. Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and
time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to

Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where
this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute
bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10].

Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local
bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy
is not affected by the presence of global bidders.

participate in auctions that they are already familiar with.
Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions
selling the same type of item. Even if this is known, 
however, additional information such as the distribution of the
valuations of other bidders and the number of participating
bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple 
auctions. This lack of expert information often drives a novice
to bid locally. Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder
to compute than a local one. An agent with bounded 
rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such
a strategy. Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on
average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently
winning multiple auctions. This deters bidders who are 
either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating
in multiple auction. As a result, in most market places we
expect a combination of global and local bidders.
In view of the above considerations, human buyers are
more likely to bid locally. The global strategy, however, can
be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can
gather data from many auctions and perform the required
calculations within the desired time frame.
