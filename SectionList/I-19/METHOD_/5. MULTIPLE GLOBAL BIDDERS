As argued in section 3.2, we expect a real-world market to
exhibit a mix of global and local bidders. Whereas so far we
assumed a single global bidder, in this section we consider a
setting where multiple global bidders interact with one 
another and with local bidders as well. The analysis of this
problem is complex, however, as the optimal bidding 
strategy of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global
bidders. A typical analytical approach is to find the 
symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all
global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids,
and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally 
deviate from the chosen strategy. Due to the complexity of the
problem, however, here we combine a computational 
simulation approach with analytical results. The simulation works
by iteratively finding the best response to the optimal 
bidding strategies in the previous iteration. If this should result
in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding 
strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the
solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium.
5.1 The Global Bidder"s Expected Utility
In order to find a global bidder"s best response, we first need
to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and
the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the
local bidders. In the following, let Ng denote the number of
other global bidders. Furthermore, let the strategies of the
other global bidders be represented by the set of functions
βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a
bidder"s valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use
the same set of functions since we consider symmetric 
equilibria. However, we assume that the assignment of functions
to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion
without replacement (i.e., each function is assigned exactly
once by each global bidder). Let Ω denote the set of all 
possible assignments. Each such assignment ω ∈ Ω is a (M, Ng)
matrix, where each entry ωi,j identifies the function used by
global bidder j in auction i. Note that the cardinality of Ω,
denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng
. Now, the expected utility
is the average expected utility over all possible assignments
and is given by:
U(B, v) =

βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the
probability of winning auction i, given that each global 
bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and
˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy. Here, G(b) is the probability of 
winning an auction with only local bidders as described in 
Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder
valuations as before.
5.2 The Simulation
The simulation works by discretising the space of possible
valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an
initial set of bidding functions. The best response is found by
maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in
turn, results in a new set of bidding functions. These 
functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next 
iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.
This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations
or until a stable solution has been found6
.
Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the 
utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the 
number of auctions and global bidders increases. Therefore, we
reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two
dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the
auctions and low in all the others7
. This simplification is
justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for
a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal
global bid consist of at most two different values.
The results reported here are based on the following 
settings.8
In order to emphasize that the valuations are 
discrete, we use integer values ranging from 1 to 1000. Each
valuation occurs with equal probability, equivalent to a 
uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case. A 
bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid 
levels. Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈
{0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}. The local bidders are static and
bid their valuation as before. The initial set of functions can
play an important role in the experiments. Therefore, to 
ensure our results are robust, experiments are repeated with
different random initial functions.
5.3 The Results
First, we describe the results with no local bidders. For this
case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable
state. That is, when there is at least one other global bidder,
the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of
the number of iterations and of the initial state. The 
fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between
two states. Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and
M = 5. The two states vary most when there are at least as
many auctions as there are global bidders. In that case, one
of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction
and zero in all others. The best response to that, however,
is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all 
auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very
low payment. The best response is then again to bid 
truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in
that particular auction. As a result, there exists no stable
solution. The same result is observed when the number of
global bidders is less than the number of auctions. This 
oc6
This approach is similar to an alternating-move 
bestresponse process with pure strategies [4], although here we
consider symmetric strategies within a setting where an 
opponent"s best response depends on its valuation.
7
Note that the number of possible allocations still increases
with the number of auctions and global bids. However, by
merging all utility-equivalent permutations, we significantly
increase computation speed, allowing experiments with 
relatively large numbers of auctions and bidders to be performed
(e.g., a single iteration with 50 auctions and 10 global bidders
takes roughly 30 seconds on a 3.00 Ghz PC).
8
We also performed experiments with different precision,
other valuation distributions, and dynamic local bidders. We
find that the prinicipal conclusions generalise to these 
different settings, and therefore we omit the results to avoid
repetitiveness.

curs since global bidders randomise over auctions, and thus
they cannot coordinate and choose to bid high in different
auctions.
As shown in Figure 2, a similar fluctuation is observed
when the number of global bidders increases relative to the
number of auctions. However, the bids in the equal-bid state
(state 2 in Figure 2), as well as the low bids of the other
state, increase. Moreover, if the number of global bidders is
increased even further, a bifurcation occurs in the equal-bid
state similar to the case without local bidders.
We now consider the best response strategies when both 
local and global bidders participate and each auction contains
the same number of local bidders. To this end, Figure 3
shows the average variance of the best response strategies.
This is measured as the variance of an actual best-response
bid over different iterations, and then taking the average over
the discrete bidder valuations. Here, the variance is a gauge
for the amount of fluctuation and thus the instability of the
strategy. As can be seen from this figure, local bidders have
a large stabilising effect on the global bidder strategies. As a
result, the best response strategy approximates a pure 
symmetric Nash equilibrium. We note that the results converge
after only a few iterations.
The results show that the principal conclusions in the case
of a single global bidder carry over to the case of multiple
global bidders. That is, the optimal strategy is to bid 
positive in all auctions (as long as there are at least as many 
bidders as auctions). Furthermore, a similar bifurcation point
is observed. These results are very robust to changes to the
auction settings and the parameters of the simulation.
To conclude, even though a theoretical analysis proves 
difficult in case of several global bidders, we can approximate
a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium for specific settings using a
discrete simulation in case the system consists of both local
and global bidders. Thus, our simulation can be used as a
tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the 
optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect
a combination of local and global bidders.
