6.1 Datasets
We used two LDC [18] datasets TDT2 and TDT3 for our
experiments. TDT2 contains news stories from January to June
1998. It contains around 54,000 stories from sources like ABC,
Associated Press, CNN, New York Times, Public Radio
International, Voice of America etc. Only English stories in the
collection were considered. TDT3 contains approximately 31,000
English stories collected from October to December 1998. In
addition to the sources used in TDT2, it also contains stories from
NBC and MSNBC TV broadcasts. We used transcribed versions
of the TV and radio broadcasts besides textual news.
TDT2 dataset is labeled with about 100 topics, and approximately
12,000 English stories belong to at least one of these topics. TDT3
dataset is labeled with about 120 topics, and approximately 8000
English stories belong to at least one of these topics. All the topics
are classified into 11 Rules of Interpretation: (1)Elections,
(2)Scandals/Hearings, (3)Legal/Criminal Cases, (4)Natural
Disasters, (5)Accidents, (6)Ongoing Violence or War, (7)Science
and Discovery News, (8)Finance, (9)New Law, (10)Sports News,
(11)MISC. News.
6.2 Evaluation Metric
TDT uses a cost function CDet that combines the probabilities of
missing a new story and a false alarm [19]:
* * * *Det Miss Miss Target FA FA NontargetC C P P C P P= + (12)
Table 2. Average correlation between term types and news classes
where CMiss means the cost of missing a new story, PMiss means
the probability of missing a new story, and PTarget means the
probability of seeing a new story in the data; CFA means the cost
of a false alarm, PFA means the probability of a false alarm, and
PNontarget means the probability of seeing an old story. The cost
CDet is normalized such that a perfect system scores 0 and a trivial
system, which is the better one of mark all stories as new or old,
scores 1:

New event detection system gives two outputs for each story. The
first part is yes or no indicating whether the story triggers a
new event or not. The second part is a score indicating confidence
of the first decision. Confidence scores can be used to plot DET
curve, i.e., curves that plot false alarm vs. miss probabilities.
Minimum normalized cost can be determined if optimal threshold
on the score were chosen.
