Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) program aims to develop
techniques which can effectively organize, search and structure
news text materials from a variety of newswire and broadcast
media [1]. New Event Detection (NED) is one of the five tasks in
TDT. It is the task of online identification of the earliest report for
each topic as soon as that report arrives in the sequence of
documents. A Topic is defined as a seminal event or activity,
along with directly related events and activities [2]. An Event is
defined as something (non-trivial) happening in a certain place at
a certain time [3]. For instance, when a bomb explodes in a
building, the exploding is the seminal event that triggers the topic,
and other stories on the same topic would be those discussing
salvaging efforts, the search for perpetrators, arrests and trial and
so on. Useful news information is usually buried in a mass of data
generated everyday. Therefore, NED systems are very useful for
people who need to detect novel information from real-time news
stream. These real-life needs often occur in domains like financial
markets, news analysis, and intelligence gathering.
In most of state-of-the-art (currently) NED systems, each news
story on hand is compared to all the previous received stories. If
all the similarities between them do not exceed a threshold, then
the story triggers a new event. They are usually in the form of
cosine similarity or Hellinger similarity metric. The core problem
of NED is to identify whether two stories are on the same topic.
Obviously, these systems cannot take advantage of topic
information. Further more, it is not acceptable in real applications
because of the large amount of computation required in the NED
process. Other systems organize previous stories into clusters
(each cluster corresponds to a topic), and new story is compared to
the previous clusters instead of stories. This manner can reduce
comparing times significantly. Nevertheless, it has been proved
that this manner is less accurate [4, 5]. This is because sometimes
stories within a topic drift far away from each other, which could
lead low similarity between a story and its topic.
On the other hand, some proposed NED systems tried to improve
accuracy by making better use of named entities [10, 11, 12, 13].
However, none of the systems have considered that terms of
different types (e.g. Noun, Verb or Person name) have different
effects for different classes of stories in determining whether two
stories are on the same topic. For example, the names of election
candidates (Person name) are very important for stories of election
class; the locations (Location name) where accidents happened are
important for stories of accidents class.
So, in NED, there still exist following three problems to be
investigated: (1) How to speed up the detection procedure while
do not decrease the detection accuracy? (2) How to make good
use of cluster (topic) information to improve accuracy? (3) How to
obtain better news story representation by better understanding of
named entities.
Driven by these problems, we have proposed three approaches in
this paper. (1)To make the detection procedure faster, we propose
a new NED procedure based on news indexing-tree created
dynamically. Story indexing-tree is created by assembling similar
stories together to form news clusters in different hierarchies
according to their values of similarity. Comparisons between
current story and previous clusters could help find the most
similar story in less comparing times. The new procedure can
reduce the amount of comparing times without hurting accuracy.
(2)We use the clusters of the first floor in the indexing-tree as
news topics, in which term weights are adjusted dynamically
according to term distribution in the clusters. In this approach,
cluster (topic) information is used properly, so the problem of
theme decentralization is avoided. (3)Based on observations on
the statistics obtained from training data, we found that terms of
different types (e.g. Noun and Verb) have different effects for
different classes of stories in determining whether two stories are
on the same topic. And we propose to use statistics to optimize the
weights of the terms of different types in a story according to the
news class that the story belongs to. On TDT3 dataset, the new
NED model just uses 14.9% comparing times of the basic model,
while its minimum normalized cost is 0.5012, which is 0.0797
better than the basic model, and also better than any other results
previously reported for this dataset [8, 13].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start off this
paper by summarizing the previous work in NED in section 2.
Section 3 presents the basic model for NED that most current
systems use. Section 4 describes our new detection procedure
based on news indexing-tree. In section 5, two term reweighting
methods are proposed to improve NED accuracy. Section 6 gives
our experimental data and evaluation metrics. We finally wrap up
with the experimental results in Section 7, and the conclusions and
future work in Section 8.
