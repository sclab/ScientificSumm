We have proposed a news indexing-tree based detection
procedure in our model. It reduces comparing times to about one
seventh of traditional method without hurting NED accuracy. We
also have presented two extensions to the basic TF-IDF model.
The first extension is made by adjust term weights based on term
distributions between the whole corpus and a cluster story set.
And the second extension to basic TF-IDF model is better use of
term types (named entities types and part-of-speed) according to
news categories. Our experimental results on TDT2 and TDT3
datasets show that both of the two extensions contribute
significantly to improvement in accuracy.
We did not consider news time information as a clue for NED
task, since most of the topics last for a long time and TDT data
sets only span for a relative short period (no more than 6 months).
For the future work, we want to collect news set which span for a
longer period from internet, and integrate time information in
NED task. Since topic is a relative coarse-grained news cluster,
we also want to refine cluster granularity to event-level, and
identify different events and their relations within a topic.
