In our previous discussion, norm conflict and inconsistency were
detected via a direct comparison of the atomic formulae 
representing the action. However, conflicts and inconsistencies may also
arise indirectly via relationships among actions. For instance, if
p(X) amounts to q(X, X), then norms PA:Rp(X) and FA:Rq(X,
X) are in conflict since PA:Rp(X) can be rewritten as PA:Rq(X,
X) and we thus have both PA:Rq(X, X) and FA:Rq(X, X). In
the discussion below we concentrate on norm conflict, but norm
inconsistency can be dealt with similarly, if we change the deontic
modalities P for O.
Relationships among actions are domain-dependent. Different
domains have distinct ways of relating their actions; engineers build
ontologies to represent such relationships. We propose a simple
means to account for such relationships and show how these can
be connected to the mechanisms introduced above. Rather than
making use of sophisticated formalisms for ontology construction,
we employ a set of domain axioms, defined below:
DEF. 9. The domain axioms, denoted as Δ, are a finite and 
possibly empty set of formulae ϕ → (ϕ1 ∧ · · · ∧ ϕn) where ϕ, ϕi, 1 ≤
i ≤ n, are atomic first-order formulae.
Our example above can be captured by Δ = {(p(X) → q(X, X)),
(q(X, X) → p(X))}. By explicitly representing and manipulating
domain knowledge we achieve generality: the very same 
machinery can be used with different domains. A set of norms can have
different conflicts and inconsistencies, for distinct domains of 
application.
