Wang et al. have categorised the various security issues that
need to be addressed in publish/subscribe systems in the
future in [20]. The paper is a comprehensive overview of 
security issues in publish/subscribe systems and as such tries
to draw attention to the issues rather than providing 
solutions.
Bacon et al. in [1] examine the use of role-based access 
control in multi-domain, distributed publish/subscribe systems.
Their work is complementary to this paper: distributed
RBAC is one potential policy formalism that might use the
enforcement mechanisms we have presented.
Opyrchal and Prakash address the problem of event 
confidentiality at the last link between the subscriber and the
SHB in [10]. They correctly state that a secure group 
communication approach is infeasible in an environment like
publish/subscribe that has highly dynamic group 
memberships. As a solution they propose a scheme utilising key
caching and subscriber grouping in order to minimise the
number of required encryptions when delivering a 
publication from a SHB to a set of matching subscribers. We 
assume in our work that the SHB is powerful enough to

Both Srivatsa et al. [19] and Raiciu et al. [16] present 
mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of messages in 
decentralised publish/subscribe infrastructures. Compared to
our work both papers aim to provide the means for 
protecting the integrity and confidentiality of messages whereas the
goal for our work is to enforce access control inside the 
broker network. Raiciu et al. assume in their work that none
of the brokers in the network are trusted and therefore all
events are encrypted from publisher to subscriber and that
all matching is based on encrypted events. In contrast, we
assume that some of the brokers on the path of a 
publication are trusted to access that publication and are therefore
able to implement event matching. We also assume that the
publisher and subscriber hosting brokers are always trusted
to access the publication. The contributions of Srivatsa et
al. and Raiciu et al. are complementary to the contributions
in this paper.
Finally, Fiege et al. address the related topic of event 
visibility in [6]. While the work concentrated on using scopes as
mechanism for structuring large-scale event-based systems,
the notion of event visibility does resonate with access 
control to some extent.
