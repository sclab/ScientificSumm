Publish/subscribe is well suited as a communication 
mechanism for building Internet-scale distributed event-driven 
applications. Much of its capacity for scale in the number
of participants comes from its decoupling of publishers and
subscribers by placing an asynchronous event delivery 
service between them. In truly Internet-scale publish/subscribe
systems, the event delivery service will include a large set
of interconnected broker nodes spanning a wide geographic
(and thus network) area.
However, publish/subscribe systems that do span a wide 
geographic area are likely to also span multiple administrative
domains, be they independent administrative domains inside
a single organisation, multiple independent organisations, or
a combination of the two.
While the communication capabilities of publish/subscribe
systems are well proved, spanning multiple administrative
domains is likely to require addressing security 
considerations. As security and access control are almost the 
antithesis of decoupling, relatively little publish/subscribe research
has focused on security so far.
Our overall research aim is to develop Internet-scale 
publish/subscribe networks that provide secure, efficient 
delivery of events, fault-tolerance and self-healing in the delivery
infrastructure, and a convenient event interface.
In [12] Pesonen et al. propose a multi-domain, 
capabilitybased access control architecture for publish/subscribe 
systems. The architecture provides a mechanism for 
authorising event clients to publish and subscribe to event types.
The privileges of the client are checked by the local broker
that the client connects to in order to access the publish/
subscribe system. The approach implements access control
at the edge of the broker network and assumes that all 
brokers can be trusted to enforce the access control policies 
correctly. Any malicious, compromised or unauthorised broker
is free to read and write any events that pass through it
on their way from the publishers to the subscribers. This
might be acceptable in a relatively small system deployed
inside a single organisation, but it is not appropriate in a
multi-domain environment in which organisations share a
common infrastructure.
We propose enforcing access control within the broker 
network by encrypting event content, and that policy dictate
controls over the necessary encryption keys. With encrypted
event content only those brokers that are authorised to 
ac104
cess the encryption keys are able to access the event content
(i.e. publish, subscribe to, or filter). We effectively move
the enforcement of access control from the brokers to the
encryption key managers.
We expect that access control would need to be enforced
in a multi-domain publish/subscribe system when 
multiple organisations form a shared publish/subscribe system
yet run multiple independent applications. Access control
might also be needed when a single organisation consists
of multiple sub-domains that deliver confidential data over
the organisation-wide publish/subscribe system. Both cases
require access control because event delivery in a dynamic
publish/subscribe infrastructure based on a shared broker
network may well lead to events being routed through 
unauthorised domains along their paths from publishers to 
subscribers.
There are two particular benefits to sharing the publish/
subscribe infrastructure, both of which relate to the 
broker network. First, sharing brokers will create a physically
larger network that will provide greater geographic reach.
Second, increasing the inter-connectivity of brokers will 
allow the publish/subscribe system to provide higher 
faulttolerance.
Figure 1 shows the multi-domain publish/subscribe network
we use as an example throughout this paper. It is based
on the United Kingdom Police Forces, and we show three
particular sub-domains:
Metropolitan Police Domain. This domain contains a
set of CCTV cameras that publish information about
the movements of vehicles around the London area.
We have included Detective Smith as a subscriber in
this domain.
Congestion Charge Service Domain. The charges that
are levied on the vehicles that have passed through the
London Congestion Charge zone each day are issued
by systems within this domain. The source 
numberplate recognition data comes from the cameras in the
Metropolitan Police Domain. The fact that the CCS
are only authorised to read a subset of the vehicle event
data will exercise some of the key features of the 
enforceable publish/subscribe system access control 
presented in this paper.
PITO Domain. The Police Information Technology 
Organisation (PITO) is the centre from which Police data
standards are managed. It is the event type owner in
this particular scenario.
Encryption protects the confidentiality of events should they
be transported through unauthorised domains. However 
encrypting whole events means unauthorised brokers cannot
make efficient routing decisions.
Our approach is to apply encryption to the individual 
attributes of events. This way our multi-domain access 
control policy works at a finer granularity - publishers and 
subscribers may be authorised access to a subset of the available
attributes. In cases where non-encrypted events are used
for routing, we can reduce the total number of events sent
through the system without revealing the values of sensitive
attributes.
In our example scenario, the Congestion Charge Service
would only be authorised to read the numberplate field of
vehicle sightings - the location attribute would not be 
decrypted. We thus preserve the privacy of motorists while
still allowing the CCS to do its job using the shared 
publish/subscribe infrastructure.
Let us assume that a Metropolitan Police Service detective
is investigating a crime and she is interested in sightings
of a specific vehicle. The detective gets a court order that
authorises her to subscribe to numberplate events of the
specific numberplate related to her case.
Current publish/subscribe access control systems enforce 
security at the edge of the broker network where clients 
connect to it. However this approach will often not be 
acceptable in Internet-scale systems. We propose enforcing 
security within the broker network as well as at the edges that
event clients connect to, by encrypting event content. 
Publications will be encrypted with their event type specific 
encryption keys. By controlling access to the encryption keys,
we can control access to the event types. The proposed 
approach allows event brokers to route events even when they
have access only to a subset of the potential encryption keys.
We introduce decentralised publish/subscribe systems and
relevant cryptography in Section 2. In Section 3 we present
our model for encrypting event content on both the event
and the attribute level. Section 4 discusses managing 
encryption keys in multi-domain publish/subscribe systems.
We analytically evaluate the performance of our proposal
in Section 5. Finally Section 6 discusses related work in
securing publish/subscribe systems and Section 7 provides
concluding remarks.
