Event content encryption can be used to enforce an access
control policy while events are in transit in the broker 
network of a multi-domain publish/subscribe system. 
Encryption causes an overhead, but i) there may be no 
alternative when access control is required, and ii) the performance
penalty can be lessened with implementation optimisations,
such as passing cached plaintext content alongside encrypted
content between brokers with identical security credentials.
This is particularly appropriate if broker-to-broker 
connections are secured by default so that wire-sniffing is not an
issue.
Attribute level encryption can be implemented in order to
enforce fine-grained access control policies. In addition to
providing attribute-level access control, attribute encryption
enables partially authorised brokers to implement 
contentbased routing based on the attributes that are accessible to
them.
Our experiments show that i) by caching plaintext and 
ciphertext content when possible, we are able to deliver 
comparable performance to plaintext events, and ii) that 
attribute encryption within an event incurs far less overhead
than defining separate event types for the attributes that
need different levels of protection.
In environments comprising multiple domains, where 
eventbrokers have different security credentials, we have 
quantified how a trade-off can be made between performance and
expressiveness.
