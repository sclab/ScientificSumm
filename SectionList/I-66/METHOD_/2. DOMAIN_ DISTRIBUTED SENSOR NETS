Distributed sensor networks are a large, important class of 
domains that motivate our work. This paper focuses on a set of target
tracking problems that arise in certain types of sensor networks [6]
first introduced in [10]. Figure 1 shows a specific problem instance
within this type consisting of three sensors. Here, each sensor node
can scan in one of four directions: North, South, East or West (see
Figure 1). To track a target and obtain associated reward, two 
sensors with overlapping scanning areas must coordinate by scanning
the same area simultaneously. In Figure 1, to track a target in 
Loc11, sensor1 needs to scan ‘East" and sensor2 needs to scan ‘West"
simultaneously. Thus, sensors have to act in a coordinated fashion.
We assume that there are two independent targets and that each
target"s movement is uncertain and unaffected by the sensor agents.
Based on the area it is scanning, each sensor receives observations
that can have false positives and false negatives. The sensors" 
observations and transitions are independent of each other"s actions
e.g.the observations that sensor1 receives are independent of 
sensor2"s actions. Each agent incurs a cost for scanning whether the
target is present or not, but no cost if it turns off. Given the sensors"
observational uncertainty, the targets" uncertain transitions and the
distributed nature of the sensor nodes, these sensor nets provide a
useful domains for applying distributed POMDP models.
