In this work we introduce a novel non-cooperative game model
to characterize the caching problem among selfish servers without
any central coordination. We show that pure strategy Nash 
equilibria exist in the game and that the price of anarchy can be O(n) in
general, where n is the number of servers, due to undersupply 
problems. With specific topologies, we show that the price of anarchy
can have tighter bounds. More importantly, with payments, servers
are incentivized to replicate and the optimistic price of anarchy is
always one. Non-cooperative caching is a more realistic model than
cooperative caching in the competitive Internet, hence this work is
an important step toward viable federated caching systems.
