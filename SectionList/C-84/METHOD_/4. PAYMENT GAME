In this section, we present an extension to the basic game with
payments and analyze the price of anarchy and the optimistic price
of anarchy of the game.
4.1 Game Model
The new game, which we refer to as the payment game, allows
each player to offer a payment to another player to give the latter
incentive to replicate the object. The cost of replication is shared
among the nodes paying the server that replicates the object.
The strategy for each player i is specified by a triplet (vi, bi, ti) ∈
{N, Ê+, Ê+}. vi specifies the player to whom i makes a bid,
bi ≥ 0 is the value of the bid, and ti ≥ 0 denotes a threshold
for payments beyond which i will replicate the object. In addition,
we use Ri to denote the total amount of bids received by a node i
(Ri =
Èj:vj =i bj).
A node i replicates the object if and only if Ri ≥ ti, that is, the
amount of bids it receives is greater than or equal to its threshold.
Let Ii denote the corresponding indicator variable, that is, Ii equals
1 if i replicates the object, and 0 otherwise. We make the rule that
if a node i makes a bid to another node j and j replicates the object,
then i must pay j the amount bi. If j does not replicate the object,
i does not pay j.
Given a strategy profile, the outcome of the game is the set of
tuples {(Ii, vi, bi, Ri)}. Ii tells us whether player i replicates the
object or not, bi is the payment player i makes to player vi, and
Ri is the total amount of bids received by player i. To compute
the payoffs given the outcome, we must now take into account the
payments a node makes, in addition to the placement costs and
access costs of the basic game.
By our rules, a server node i pays bi to node vi if vi replicates
the object, and receives a payment of Ri if it replicates the object
itself. Its net payment is biIvi − RiIi. The total cost incurred by
each node is the sum of its placement cost, access cost, and net
payment. It is defined as
Ci(S) = αij Ii + wij di (i,j)(1 − Ii) + biIvi − RiIi. (10)
The cost of social optimum for the payment game is same as that
for the basic game, since the net payments made cancel out.
4.2 Analysis
In analyzing the payment model, we first show that a Nash 
equilibrium in the basic game is also a Nash equilibrium in the payment
game. We then present an important positive result - in the 
payment game the socially optimal configuration can always be 
implemented by a Nash equilibrium. We know from the counterexample
in Figure 2 that this is not guaranteed in the the basic game. In this
analysis we use α to represent αij .
THEOREM 2. Any configuration that is a pure strategy Nash
equilibrium in the basic game is also a pure strategy Nash 
equilibrium in the payment game. Therefore, the price of anarchy of the
payment game is at least that of the basic game.
PROOF. Consider any Nash equilibrium configuration in the 
basic game. For each node i replicating the object, set its threshold ti
to 0; everyone else has threshold α. Also, for all i, bi = 0.
A node that replicates the object does not have incentive to change
its strategy: changing the threshold does not decrease its cost, and
it would have to pay at least α to access a remote replica or 
incentivize a nearby node to cache. Therefore it is better off keeping its
threshold and bid at 0 and replicating the object.
A node that is not replicating the object can access the object 
remotely at a cost less than or equal to α. Lowering its threshold does
not decrease its cost, since all bi are zero. The payment necessary
for another server to place a replica is at least α.
No player has incentive to deviate, so the current configuration
is a Nash equilibrium.
In fact, Appendix B shows that the PoA of the payment game
can be more than that of the basic game in a given topology.
Now let us look at what happens to the example shown in 
Figure 2 in the best case. Suppose node B"s neighbors each decide
to pay node B an amount 2/n. B does not have an incentive to
deviate, since accessing the remote replica does not decrease its
cost. The same argument holds for A because of symmetry in the
graph. Since no one has an incentive to deviate, the configuration is
a Nash equilibrium. Its total cost is 2α, the same as in the socially
optimal configuration shown in Figure 2(b). Next we prove that
indeed the payment game always has a strategy profile that 
implements the socially optimal configuration as a Nash equilibrium. We
first present the following observation, which is used in the proof,
about thresholds in the payment game.
OBSERVATION 1. If node i replicates the object, j is the 
nearest node to i among the other nodes that replicate the object, and
dij < α in a Nash equilibrium, then i should have a threshold at
25
least (α − dij). Otherwise, it cannot collect enough payment to
compensate for the cost of replicating the object and is better off
accessing the replica at j.
THEOREM 3. In the payment game, there is always a pure 
strategy Nash equilibrium that implements the social optimum 
configuration. The optimistic price of anarchy in the payment game is
therefore always one.
PROOF. Consider the socially optimal configuration φopt. Let
No be the set of nodes that replicate the object and Nc = N − No
be the rest of the nodes. Also, for each i in No, let Qi denote the
set of nodes that access the object from i, not including i itself. In
the socially optimal configuration, dij ≤ α for all j in Qi.
We want to find a set of payments and thresholds that makes this
configuration implementable. The idea is to look at each node i in
No and distribute the minimum payment needed to make i replicate
the object among the nodes that access the object from i. For each
i in No, and for each j in Qi, we define
δj = min{α, min
k∈No−{i}
djk} − dji (11)
Note that δj is the difference between j"s cost for accessing the
replica at i and j"s next best option among replicating the object
and accessing some replica other than i. It is clear that δj ≥ 0.
CLAIM 1. For each i ∈ No, let be the nearest node to i in
No. Then,
Èj∈Qi
δj ≥ α − di .
PROOF. (of claim) Assume the contrary, that is,
Èj∈Qi
δj <
α − di . Consider the new configuration φnew wherein i does not
replicate and each node in Qi chooses its next best strategy (either
replicating or accessing the replica at some node in No − {i}). In
addition, we still place replicas at each node in No − {i}. It is easy
to see that cost of φopt minus cost of φnew is at least:
(α +
j∈Qi
dij) − (di +
j∈Qi
min{α, min
k∈No−{i}
dik})
= α − di −
j∈Qi
δj > 0,
which contradicts the optimality of φopt.
We set bids as follows. For each i in No, bi = 0 and for each j
in Qi, j bids to i (i.e., vj = i) the amount:
bj = max{0, δj − i/(|Qi| + 1)}, j ∈ Qi (12)
where i =
Èj∈Qi
δj − α + di ≥ 0 and |Qi| is the cardinality of
Qi. For the thresholds, we have:
ti =
α if i ∈ Nc;Èj∈Qi
bj if i ∈ No.
(13)
This fully specifies the strategy profile of the nodes, and it is easy
to see that the outcome is indeed the socially optimal configuration.
Next, we verify that the strategies stipulated constitute a Nash
equilibrium. Having set ti to α for i in Nc means that any node
in N is at least as well off lowering its threshold and replicating
as bidding α to some node in Nc to make it replicate, so we may
disregard the latter as a profitable strategy. By observation 1, to
ensure that each i in No does not deviate, we require that if is the
nearest node to i in No, then
Èj∈Qi
bj is at least (α − di ). 
Otherwise, i will raise ti above
Èj∈Qi
bj so that it does not replicate
and instead accesses the replica at . We can easily check that
j∈Qi
bj ≥

δj −

Figure 3: We present P oA, Ratio, and OP oA results for the basic
game, varying α on a 100-node line topology, and we show number
of replicas placed by the Nash equilibria and by the optimal solution.
We see large peaks in P oA and OP oA at α = 100, where a phase
transition causes an abrupt transition in the lines.
Therefore, each node i ∈ No does not have incentive to change
ti since i loses its payments received or there is no change, and i
does not have incentive to bi since it replicates the object. Each
node j in Nc has no incentive to change tj since changing tj does
not reduce its cost. It also does not have incentive to reduce bj
since the node where j accesses does not replicate and j has to
replicate the object or to access the next closest replica, which costs
at least the same from the definition of bj . No player has incentive
to deviate, so this strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium.
