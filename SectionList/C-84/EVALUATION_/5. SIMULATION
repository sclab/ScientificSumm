We run simulations to compare Nash equilibria for the 
singleobject caching game with the social optimum computed by solving
the integer linear program described in Equation 8 using Mosek [1].
We examine price of anarchy (PoA), optimistic price of anarchy
(OPoA), and the average ratio of the costs of Nash equilibria and
social optima (Ratio), and when relevant we also show the average
numbers of replicas placed by the Nash equilibrium (Replica(NE))
and the social optimum (Replica(SO)). The PoA and OPoA are
taken from the worst and best Nash equilibria, respectively, that we
observe over the runs. Each data point in our figures is based on
1000 runs, randomly varying the initial strategy profile and player
order. The details of the simulations including protocols and a 
discussion of convergence are presented in Appendix C.
In our evaluation, we study the effects of variation in four 
categories: placement cost, underlying topology, demand distribution,
and payments. As we vary the placement cost α, we directly 
influence the tradeoff between caching and not caching. In order to get
a clear picture of the dependency of PoA on α in a simple case, we
first analyze the basic game with a 100-node line topology whose
edge distance is one.
We also explore transit-stub topologies generated using the 
GTITM library [36] and power-law topologies (Router-level 
BarabasiAlbert model) generated using the BRITE topology generator [25].
For these topologies, we generate an underlying physical graph of
3050 physical nodes. Both topologies have similar minimum, 
average, and maximum physical node distances. The average distance
is 0.42. We create an overlay of 100 server nodes and use the same
overlay for all experiments with the given topology.
In the game, each server has a demand whose distribution is
Bernoulli(p), where p is the probability of having demand for the
object; the default unless otherwise specified is p = 1.0.

Figure 5: Power-law topology: (a) basic game, (b) payment game. We show the P oA, Ratio, OP oA, and the number of replicas placed while
varying α between 0 and 2 with 100 servers on a 3050-physical-node power-law topology.
5.1 Varying Placement Cost
Figure 3 shows PoA, OPoA, and Ratio, as well as number
of replicas placed, for the line topology as α varies. We observe
two phases. As α increases the PoA rises quickly to a peak at
100. After 100, there is a gradual decline. OPoA and Ratio show
behavior similar to PoA.
These behaviors can be explained by examining the number of
replicas placed by Nash equilibria and by optimal solutions. We see
that when α is above one, Nash equilibrium solutions place fewer
replicas than optimal on average. For example, when α is 100,
the social optimum places four replicas, but the Nash equilibrium
places only one. The peak in PoA at α = 100 occurs at the point
for a 100-node line where the worst-case cost of accessing a remote
replica is slightly less than the cost of placing a new replica, so 
selfish servers will never place a second replica. The optimal solution,
however, places multiple replicas to decrease the high global cost
of access. As α continues to increase, the undersupply problem
lessens as the optimal solution places fewer replicas.
5.2 Different Underlying Topologies
In Figure 4(a) we examine an overlay graph on the more realistic
transit-stub topology. The trends for the PoA, OPoA, and Ratio
are similar to the results for the line topology, with a peak in PoA
at α = 0.8 due to maximal undersupply.
In Figure 5(a) we examine an overlay graph on the power-law
topology. We observe several interesting differences between the
power-law and transit-stub results. First, the PoA peaks at a lower
level in the power-law graph, around 2.3 (at α = 0.9) while the
peak PoA in the transit-stub topology is almost 3.0 (at α = 0.8).
After the peak, PoA and Ratio decrease more slowly as α 
increases. OPoA is close to one for the whole range of α values.
This can be explained by the observation in Figure 5(a) that there
is no significant undersupply problem here like there was in the
transit-stub graph. Indeed the high PoA is due mostly to 
misplacement problems when α is from 0.7 to 2.0, since there is little
decrease in PoA when the number of replicas in social optimum
changes from two to one. The OPoA is equal to one in the figure
when the same number of replicas are placed.
5.3 Varying Demand Distribution
Now we examine the effects of varying the demand distribution.
The set of servers with demand is random for p < 1, so we 
calculate the expected PoA by averaging over 5 trials (each data point
is based on 5000 runs). We run simulations for demand levels of
p ∈ {0.2, 0.6, 1.0} as α is varied on the 100 servers on top of
the transit-stub graph. We observe that as demand falls, so does
expected PoA. As p decreases, the number of replicas placed in
the social optimum decreases, but the number in Nash equilibria
changes little. Furthermore, when α exceeds the overlay diameter,
the number in Nash equilibria stays constant when p varies. 
Therefore, lower p leads to a lesser undersupply problem, agreeing with
intuition. We do not present the graph due to space limitations and
redundancy; the PoA for p = 1.0 is identical to PoA in Figure 4(a),
and the lines for p = 0.6 and p = 0.2 are similar but lower and flatter.

5.4 Effects of Payment
Finally, we discuss the effects of payments on the efficiency of
Nash equilibria. The results are presented in Figure 4(b) and 
Figure 5(b). As shown in the analysis, the simulations achieve OPoA
close to one (it is not exactly one because of randomness in the
simulations). The Ratio for the payment game is much lower than
the Ratio for the basic game, since the protocol for the payment
game tends to explore good regions in the space of Nash 
equilibria. We observe in Figure 4 that for α ≥ 0.4, the average number
of replicas of Nash equilibria gets closer with payments to that of
the social optimum than it does without. We observe in Figure 5
that more replicas are placed with payments than without when α
is between 0.7 and 1.3, the only range of significant undersupply in
the power-law case. The results confirm that payments give servers
incentive to replicate the object and this leads to better equilibria.
