There has been considerable research on wide-area peer-to-peer
file systems such as OceanStore [22], CFS [5], PAST [32], 
FARSITE [2], and Pangaea [33], web caches such as NetCache [6] and
SummaryCache [10], and peer-to-peer caches such as Squirrel [16].
Most of these systems use caching for performance, availability,
and reliability. The caching protocols assume obedience to the 
protocol and ignore participants" incentives. Our work starts from the
assumption that servers are selfish and quantifies the cost of the
lack of coordination when servers behave selfishly.
The placement of replicas in the caching problem is the most 
important issue. There is much work on the placement of web 
replicas, instrumentation servers, and replicated resources. All 
protocols assume obedience and ignore participants" incentives. In [14],
Gribble et al. discuss the data placement problem in peer-to-peer
systems. Ko and Rubenstein propose a self-stabilizing, distributed
graph coloring algorithm for the replicated resource placement [20].
Chen, Katz, and Kubiatowicz propose a dynamic replica 
placement algorithm exploiting underlying distributed hash tables [4].
Douceur and Wattenhofer describe a hill-climbing algorithm to 
exchange replicas for reliability in FARSITE [8]. RaDar is a 
system that replicates and migrates objects for an Internet hosting 
service [31]. Tang and Chanson propose a coordinated en-route web
caching that caches objects along the routing path [34]. 
Centralized algorithms for the placement of objects, web proxies, mirrors,
and instrumentation servers in the Internet have been studied 
extensively [18,19,23,30].
The facility location problem has been widely studied as a 
centralized optimization problem in theoretical computer science and
operations research [27]. Since the problem is NP-hard, 
approximation algorithms based on primal-dual techniques, greedy 
algorithms, and local search have been explored [17, 24, 26]. Our
caching game is different from all of these in that the optimization
process is performed among distributed selfish servers.
There is little research in non-cooperative facility location games,
as far as we know. Vetta [35] considers a class of problems where
the social utility is submodular (submodularity means decreasing
marginal utility). In the case of competitive facility location among
corporations he proves that any Nash equilibrium gives an expected
social utility within a factor of 2 of optimal plus an additive term
that depends on the facility opening cost. Their results are not 
directly applicable to our problem, however, because we consider
each server to be tied to a particular location, while in their model
an agent is able to open facilities in multiple locations. Note that in
that paper the increase of the price of anarchy comes from 
oversupply problems due to the fact that competing corporations can open
facilities at the same location. On the other hand, the significant
problems in our game are undersupply and misplacement.
In a recent paper, Goemans et al. analyze content distribution on
ad-hoc wireless networks using a game-theoretic approach [12]. As
in our work, they provide monetary incentives to mobile users for
caching data items, and provide tight bounds on the price of 
anarchy and speed of convergence to (approximate) Nash equilibria.
However, their results are incomparable to ours because their 
payoff functions neglect network latencies between users, they 
consider multiple data items (markets), and each node has a limited
budget to cache items.
Cost sharing in the facility location problem has been studied
using cooperative game theory [7, 13, 29]. Goemans and Skutella
show strong connections between fair cost allocations and linear
programming relaxations for facility location problems [13]. PÂ´al
and Tardos develop a method for cost-sharing that is approximately
budget-balanced and group strategyproof and show that the method
recovers 1/3 of the total cost for the facility location game [29].
Devanur, Mihail, and Vazirani give a strategyproof cost allocation
for the facility location problem, but cannot achieve group 
strategyproofness [7].
