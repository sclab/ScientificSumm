Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of
the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed
information need can all influence the quality of the queries that
users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]). There has been a variety
of research into different ways of helping users specify their
information needs more effectively. Belkin et al. [4] experimented
with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose
description of their information needs. A similar approach was
attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to
elicit additional information about the search context from users.
These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match
retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more
relevant search results [4]. However, in Web search, where many
of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model,
longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to
a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved. It
is not simply sufficient to request more information from users;
this information must be of better quality.
Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion
[9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the
quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding
their information needs. In the case of RF, the user presents the
system with examples of relevant information that are then used to
formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.
It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain
due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF
to typical users [17]. Query suggestions offered based on query
logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with
limited user burden. This approach is limited to re-executing
popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions
presented to them [1]. In addition, both of these techniques do not
help users learn to produce more effective queries.
Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax
that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.
Query modifiers such as ‘+" (plus), ‘−" (minus), and ‘  " (double
quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query
terms. Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms
and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used
to restrict the search space. Queries created with these techniques
can be powerful. However, this functionality is often hidden from
the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the
syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo
boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to
access these features.
Log-based analysis of users" interactions with the Excite and
AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries
contained any advanced syntax [14][25]. This analysis can be a
useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR
systems. Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30]
has shown that gathering more information about users can
improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more
information about users than is typically available from
interaction logs alone. Unless coupled with a qualitative
technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be
difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics. In our
study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced
search features within the typical search interface, and the
potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do
use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of
searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.
Other studies of advanced searchers" search behaviors have
attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have
acquired. However, such studies are generally limited in size
(e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as
healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]). Nonetheless, they can give
valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system,
or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.
Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to
better understand users [31] and support other users [16].
In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of
advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is
anything different about how these search engine users search,
and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do
not make use of the advanced features of search engines. To do
this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting
users over a prolonged period.
In the next section we describe the data we use to study the
behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those
that do not use this syntax.
3. DATA
To perform this study we required a description of the querying
and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a
period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.
To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting
Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.
When downloading a partner client-side application, the users
were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being
anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each
user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1
The information contained in these log entries included a unique
identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique
browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining
which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page
visited. This provided us with sufficient data on querying
behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing
behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to
more broadly investigate search behavior.
In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we
also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined
for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.
These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained
human judges at the time the data were collected. We use these
judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users
visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.
We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who
submitted millions of queries to three popular search 
enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of
the study. To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four
operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),
  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain
or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted
contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of
users used query operators in any of their queries. In the
remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced
searchers. We acknowledge that the direct relationship between
query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied
1
It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then
their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study.
(and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a
reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation. We conjecture
that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search
expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate
behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.
To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis,
we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the
study"s 13-week duration. This left us with 188,405 users −
37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) 
nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail. If
significant differences emerge between these groups, it is
conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically
classify users and adjust a search system"s interface and result
weighting to better match the current user.
The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the
entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited
about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous
identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no
attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in
any way. All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and
no information other than consent for logging was elicited.
To find out more about these users we studied whether those
using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were
not observed in those who did not use this syntax. We focused on
querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the
user groups. In the next section we describe in more detail the
search features that we used.
