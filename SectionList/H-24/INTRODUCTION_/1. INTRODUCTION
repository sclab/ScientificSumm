The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient
aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information
Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].
Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and
Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the
quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation
marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search
to a particular site or type of file. These techniques can be useful
in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g.,
[15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research
community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.
IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to
specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced
syntax. Research on practical techniques to supplement existing
search technology and support users has been intensifying in
recent years (e.g. [18][34]). However, it is challenging to
implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.
Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of
a series of tokens separated by spaces. There is generally an
implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts
search results to documents containing all query terms. De Lima
and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase
recognition, and expansion on Web search queries. They showed
that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve
result precision in Web search. However, the value of advanced
syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most
users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand
how to use it [15]. Since it appears operators can help retrieve
relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.
In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail
and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to
use advanced syntax explicitly. We hypothesize that searchers
who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search
expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an
assertion supported by previous research [13]. Studying the
behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield
important insights about searching and result browsing from
which others may benefit.
Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we
investigate differences between the search behavior of those that
use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the
information those users target. We are interested in answering
three research questions:
(i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax
and other characteristics of a search?
(ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax
and post-query navigation behaviors?
(iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax
and measures of search success?
Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential
answers for each of these questions. A relationship between the
use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support
the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or
use advanced users" interactions to help non-advanced users be
more successful in their searches.
We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this
log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which
we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this
analysis in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of
this research, and we conclude in Section 7.
