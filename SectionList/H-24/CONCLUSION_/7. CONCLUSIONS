In this paper we have described a log-based study of search
behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of
advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search
behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query
navigation, and search success. Those that use this syntax are
active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing
search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely
to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are
more successful in there searching. These are all traits that we
would expect expert searchers to exhibit. Crude classification of
users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the
query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction
behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do. As
we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions
of these users for improved document ranking, page
recommendation, or even user training. Future work will include
the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval
engines that make use of these information-rich features, and
further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of
search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between
result click and post-query behavior.
