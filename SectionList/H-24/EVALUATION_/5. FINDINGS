Our analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior
and interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query
navigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating
judged-relevant documents. Parametric statistical testing is used,
and the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05.
5.1 Query and result-click behavior
We were interested in comparing the query and result-click
behaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users. In Table 4
we show the mean average values for each of the seven search
features for our users. We use padvanced to denote the percentage of
all queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e.,
padvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax). The
table shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%),
users who submitted at least one query with operators (≥ 0%),
through to users whose queries contained operators at least 
threequarters of the time (≥ 75%).

We compared the query and result click features of users who did
not use any advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%) in any of their
queries with those who used advanced syntax in at least one query
(padvanced > 0%). The columns corresponding to these two groups
are bolded in Table 4. We performed an independent measures 
ttest between these groups for each of the features. Since this
analysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction
to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level
(α) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features. This
correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null
hypotheses that are true. All differences between the groups were
statistically significant (all t(188403) ≥ 2.81, all p ≤ .002).
However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the
means were likely to be statistically significant. We applied a
Cohen"s d-test to determine the effect size for each of the
comparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user
groups. Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main
findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search
engine users:
• Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98)
• Compose longer queries (d = .69)
• Click further down the result list (d = .67)
• Submit more queries per day (d = .49)
• Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32)
• Repeat queries more often (d = .16)
The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will
click further down the result list implies that they may be less
trusting of the search engines" ability to rank the most relevant
document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the
most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting
different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than
navigational), or that they may have customized their search
settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.
Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in
other studies of advanced searchers" querying and result-click
behaviors [13][34]. Given that the only criteria we employed to
classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced
syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to
identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported
previously for those with more search expertise.
As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which
the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who
submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data
collection and submit at least one query containing advanced
query operators. In other words, we consider users whose
percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is
greater than zero. The use of query operators in any queries,
regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the
existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of
familiarity with the search system. We further hypothesized that
users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax
may be more advanced search engine users. To test this we
investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for
advanced status (padvanced). We incremented padvanced one
percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven
query and result-click features at each point. The values of the
features at four milestones (> 0%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75%) are
shown in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, as padvanced
increases, differences in the features between those using
advanced syntax and those not using advanced syntax become
more substantial. However, it is interesting to note that as padvanced
increases, the number of queries submitted per day actually falls
(Pearson"s R = −.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001). More advanced
users may need to pose fewer queries to find relevant information.
To study the patterns of relationship among these dependent
variables (including the padvanced), we applied factor analysis [26].
Table 5 shows the intercorrelation matrix between the features
and the percentage of queries with operators (Padvanced). Each cell
in the table contains the Pearson"s correlation coefficient between
the two features for a given row-column pair.

It is only the first data column and row that reflect the correlations
between padvanced and the other query and result-click features.
Columns 2 - 8 show the inter-correlations between the other
features. There are strong positive correlations between some of
the features (e.g., the number of words in the query (QWL) and
the average probability of clicking on a search result (ACP)).
However, there were also fairly strong negative correlations
between some features (e.g., the average length of the queries
(QWL) and the probability of clicking on a search result (CP)).
The factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that
account for 83.6% of the variance. As is standard practice in
factor analysis, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30
or less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their
respective loadings, can be expressed as:
Factor A = .98(QRR) + .97(padv) + .97(QPS)
+ .71(ACP) + .69(QWL)
Factor B = .96(CP) + .90(QPD) + .67(ACP) + .52(ASC)
Variance in the query and result-click behavior of our advanced
search engine users can be expressed using these two constructs.
Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.5% of the variance.
It appears to represent a very basic dimension of variance that
covers query attributes and querying behavior, and suggests a
relationship between query properties (length, frequency,
complexity, and repetition) and the position of users" clicks in the
result list. The dimension underlying Factor B accounts for
33.1% of the variance, and describes attributes of result-click
behavior, and a strong correlation between result clicks and the
number of queries submitted each day.
Summary: In this section we have shown that there are marked
differences in aspects of the querying and result-clickthrough
behaviors of advanced users relative to non-advanced users. We
have also shown that the greater the proportion of queries that
contain advanced syntax, the larger the differences in query and
clickthrough behaviors become. A factor analysis revealed the
presence of two dimensions that adequately characterize variance
in the query and result-click features. In the querying dimension
query attributes, such as the length and proportion that contain
advanced syntax, and querying behavior, such as the number of
queries submitted per day both affect result-click position. In
addition, in the result-click dimension, it appears that daily
querying frequency influences result-click features such as the
likelihood that a user will click on a search result and the amount
of time between result presentation and the search result click.
The features used in this section are only interactions with search
engines in the form of queries and result clicks. We did not
address how users searched for information beyond the result
page. In the next section we use the search trails described in
Section 4 to analyze the post-query browsing behavior of users.
5.2 Post-query browsing behavior
In this section we look at several attributes of the search trails
users followed beyond the results page in an attempt to discern
whether the use of advanced search syntax can be used as a
predictor of aspects of post-query interaction behavior.
As we did previously, we first describe the mean average values
for each of the browsing features, across all advanced users (i.e.
padvanced > 0%), all non-advanced users (i.e., padvanced = 0%), and all
users regardless of their estimated search expertise level. We then
look at the effect on the browsing features of increasing the value
of padvanced required to be considered advanced from 1% to
100%. In Table 6 we present the average values for each of these
features for the two groups of users. Also shown are the
percentage of search trails (%Trails) and the percentage of users
(%Users) used to compute the averages.
Table 6. Post-query browsing features (per trail).

As can be seen from Table 6, there are differences in the 
postquery interaction behaviors of advanced users (padvanced > 0%)
relative to that do not use query operators in any of their queries
(padvanced = 0%). Once again, the columns of interest in this
comparison are bolded. As we did in Section 5.1 for query and
result-click behavior, we performed an independent measures 
ttest between the values reported for each of the post-query
browsing features. The results of this test suggest that differences
between those that use advanced syntax and those that do not are
significant (t(12495029) ≥ 3.09, p ≤ .002, α = .008). Given the
sample sizes, all of the differences between means in the two
groups were significant. However, we once again applied a
Cohen"s d-test to determine the effect size. The findings (ranked
in descending order based on effect size), show that relative to
non-advanced users, advanced search engine users:
• Revisit pages in the trail less often (d = .45)
• Spend less time traversing each search trail (d = .38)
• Spend less time viewing each document (d = .28)
• Branch (i.e., proceed to new pages following a back
operation) less often (d = .18)
• Follow search trails with fewer steps (d = .16)
It seems that advanced users use a more directed searching style
than non-advanced users. They spend less time following search
trails and view the documents that lie on those trails for less time.
This is in accordance with our earlier proposition that advanced
users seem able to discern document relevance in less time.
Advanced users also tend to deviate less from a direct path as they
search, with fewer revisits to previously-visited pages and less
branching during their searching.
As we did in the previous section, we increased the padvanced
threshold one point at a time. With the exception of number of
back operations (NB), the values attributable to each of the
features change as padvanced increased. It seems that the differences
noted earlier between non-advanced users and those that use any
advanced syntax become more significant as padvanced increases.
As in the previous section, we conducted a factor analysis of these
features and padvanced. Table 7 shows the intercorrelation matrix
for all these variables.

NBA 1.00
As the proportion of queries containing advanced syntax
increases, the values of many of the post-query browsing features
decrease. Only the average session time (SS) exhibits a strong
positive correlation with padvanced. The factor analysis revealed the
presence of two factors that account for 89.8% of the variance.
Once again, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or
less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their
respective loadings, can be expressed as:
Factor A = .95(DS) + .88 (TS) − .91(SS) − .95(padv)
Factor B = .99(NBA) + .93(NS) + .91(NB)
Variance in the query and result-click behavior of those who use
query operators can be expressed using these two constructs.
Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.1% of the variance.
It appears to represent a very basic temporal dimension that
covers timing and percentage of queries with advanced syntax,
and suggests a negative relationship between time spent searching
and overall session time, and a negative relationship between time
spent searching and padvanced. The navigation dimension
underlying Factor B accounts for 39.7% of the variance, and
describes attributes of post-query navigation, all of which seem to
be strongly correlated with each other but not padvanced or timing.
Summary: In this section we have shown that advanced users"
post-query browsing behavior appears more directed than that of
non-advanced users. Although their search sessions are longer,
advanced users follow fewer search trails during their sessions,
(i.e., submit fewer queries), their search trails are shorter, and
their trails exhibit fewer deviations or regressions to previously
encountered pages. We also showed that as padvanced increases,
session time increases (perhaps more advanced users are
multitasking between search and other operations), and search
interaction becomes more focused, perhaps because advanced
users are able target relevant information more effectively, with
less need for regressions or deviations in their search trails.
As well as interaction behaviors such as queries, result clicks, and
post-query browse behavior, another important aspect of the
search process is the attainment of information relevant to the
query. In the next section we analyze the success of advanced and
non-advanced users in obtaining relevant information.
5.3 Search success
As described earlier, we used six-level relevance judgments
assigned to query-document pairs as an approximate measure of
search success based on documents encountered on search trails.
However, the queries for which we have judgments generally did
not contain advanced operators. To maximize the likelihood of
coverage we removed advanced operators from all queries when
retrieving the relevance judgments. The mean average relevance
judgment values for each of the four metrics - first, last, average,
and maximum - are shown in Table 8 for non-advanced users
(0%) and advanced users (> 0%).
Table 8. Search success (min. = 1, max. = 6) (per trail).

First M 4.03 4.19 4.24 4.26 4.57
SD 1.58 1.56 1.34 1.38 1.27
Last M 3.79 3.92 4.00 4.13 4.35

Avg. M 3.93 4.06 4.08 4.08 4.26
SD 1.57 1.51 1.23 1.32 1.14
The findings suggest that users who use advanced syntax at all
(padvanced > 0%) were more successful - across all four 
measuresthan those who never used advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%). Not
only were these users more successful in their searching, but they
were consistently more successful (i.e., the standard deviation in
relevance scores is lower for advanced users and continues to drop
as padvanced increases). The differences in the four mean average
relevance scores for each metric between these two user groups
were significant with independent measures t-tests (all t(516765)
≥ 3.29, p ≤ .001, α = .0125). As we increase the value of padvanced
as in previous sections, the average relevance score across all
metrics also increases (all Pearson"s R ≥ .654), suggesting that
more advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their
searching. The searchers that use advanced operators may have
additional skills in locating relevant information, or may know
where this information resides based on previous experience.3
Despite the fact that the four metrics targeted different parts of the
search trail (e.g., first vs. last) or different ways to gather relevant
information (e.g., average vs. maximum), the differences between
groups and within the advanced group were consistent.
3
Although in our logs there was no obvious indication of more
revisitation by advanced search engine users.
To see whether there were any differences in the nature of the
queries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the
distribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus,
minus, and site:. In Table 9 we show how these operators were
distributed in all queries submitted by these users.
Table 9. Distribution of query operators.
Feature
padvanced
> 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75%
Quotes () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00
Plus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90
Minus (−) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42
Site: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86
Avg. num. operators 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49
The distribution of the quotes, plus, and minus operators are
similar amongst the four levels of padvanced, with quotes being the
most popular of the four operators used. However, it appears that
the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced
user groups. This operator, which forces the search engine to
include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default
(e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference
in observed search success.4
However, this does not capture the
contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in
relevance compared with excluding the operator. To gain some
insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the
operators had on the relevance of retrieved results. We focused
on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a
query without operators and the same query with operators either
before or afterwards. Although there were few queries with
matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there
was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average
relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with
quotes in the initial query. It may be the case that quoted queries
led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better
match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead
to judged documents receiving higher scores. More analysis
similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.
Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study
the search success of advanced and non-advanced users. The
findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users
are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of
the pages they visit. Their additional search expertise may make
these users better able to make better decisions about which
documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more
relevant information on their searches. In addition, within the
group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between
padvanced and the degree of search success. Advanced search
engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to
formulate powerful query statements. We now discuss the
findings from all three subsections and their implications for the
design of improved Web search systems.

It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the
distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google,
Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search
engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced.
