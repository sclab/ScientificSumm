Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying,
result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those
that use advanced syntax versus those that do not. Many of these
findings mirror those already found in previous studies with
groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19]. There are
several ways in which a commercial search engine system might
benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise. This
might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it
may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer
different pages than novice searchers. The user interface to a
search engine might be tailored to a user"s expertise level; perhaps
even more advanced features such as term weighting and query
expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced
searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for
novices. Result presentation might also be customized based on
search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of
content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different
outcomes for different expertise levels. Additionally, if browsing
histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers
could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and
potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].
The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to
guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the
designers of search systems. In part, these searchers may have
more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome
the shortcomings of search systems [29]. Their interactions can
be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users
visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to
search more effectively. However, if expert users are going to be
used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.
Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose
interactions we studied. Whilst these may be amongst the most
active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover
large number of subject areas. However, rather than focusing on
where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with
domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use
moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn
from. Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn
how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching
style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful
post-query interactions.
One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior
research, it has been shown that query operators do not
significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8],
and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without
them [27]. It could therefore be argued that the users who do not
use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not
waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query
statements. However, this seems unlikely given that those who
use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users
with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.
However, in future work we will expand of definition of
advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include
other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this
study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12].
