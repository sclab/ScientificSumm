In the early morning hours (05:30 GMT) of January 25,
2003 the fastest computer worm in recorded history began
spreading throughout the Internet. Within 10 minutes after
the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all 
vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant 
disruption to the global Internet infrastructure. Vern Paxson of
the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer
commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that 
human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part,
from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it
was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior,
namely self-reproduction. Since Slammer, researchers have
explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have
designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate
detection and limiting algorithms. For example, Zou, et al.,
[2], proposed a scheme where a Kalman filter is used to 
detect the early propagation of a worm. Other researchers
have proposed the use of detectors where rates of 
Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and
a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the 
organization to the potential presence of a worm. However, such
strategies suffer from the fighting the last War syndrome.
That is, systems are being designed and developed to 
effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of
Slammer.
In the work described here, we put forth the 
hypothesis that next generation worms will be different, and 
therefore such techniques may have some significant limitations.
Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms
called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the
concept of emergent intelligence. The concept of emergent
intelligence was first studied in association with biological
systems. In such studies, early researchers discovered a 
variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild.
A flock of birds sweeps across the sky. A group of ants
forages for food. A school of fish swims, turns, flees 
together away from a predator, ands so forth. In general, this
kind of aggregate motion has been called swarm 
behavior. Biologists, and computer scientists in the field of 
artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and
323
attempted to create models that explain how the elements
of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve. Moreover, in
recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become
increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design
of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETS), the design of 
Intrusion Detection Systems, the study of traffic patterns in
transportation systems, in military applications, and other
areas, see [3].
The basic concepts that have been developed over the last
decade to explain swarms, and swarm behavior include
four basic components. These are:
1. Simplicity of logic & actions: A swarm is composed of
N agents whose intelligence is limited. Agents in the
swarm use simple local rules to govern their actions.
Some models called this primitive actions or behaviors;
2. Local Communication Mechanisms: Agents interact
with other members in the swarm via simple local
communication mechanisms. For example, a bird in a
flock senses the position of adjacent bird and applies
a simple rule of avoidance and follow.
3. Distributed control: Autonomous agents interact with
their environment, which probably consists of other
agents, but act relatively independently from all other
agents. There is no central command or leader, and
certainly there is no global plan.
4. Emergent Intelligence: Aggregate behavior of 
autonomous agents results in complex intelligent 
behaviors; including self-organization.
In order to understand fully the behavior of such swarms
it is necessary to construct a model that explains the 
behavior of what we will call generic worms. This model, which
extends the work by Weaver [5] is presented here in section 2.
In addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way
that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of
potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm
Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit
a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed
intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more 
harmful than their similar generic counterparts. Specifically, the
first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was
created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a simple password 
cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and
information sharing strategies. Such a swarm worm was 
deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as
well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology. Preliminary
results showed that such worms are capable of 
compromising hosts at rates up to two orders of magnitude faster than
their generic counterpart. The rest of this manuscript is
structure as follows. In section 2 an abstract model of both
generic worms as well as swarm worms is presented. This
model is used in section 2.6 to described the first instance
of a swarm worm, ZachiK. In section 4, preliminary results
via both empirical measurements as well as simulation is
presented. Finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights
into future work are presented.
