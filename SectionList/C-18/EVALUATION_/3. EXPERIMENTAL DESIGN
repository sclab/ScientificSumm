In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are
more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known
327
worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator,
capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies
(IPV4 space), was developed. The network testbed 
consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.
The simulator was written in C++
. The simple swarm worm
described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and
then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own
mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm
behaviors.
In the case of a simple local area network of 30 
computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space
of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected. At the start of
the experiment a single known password is known, that of
patient-zero. All shared passwords are distributed randomly
across all nodes. Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a
network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were 
selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were 
selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to
specific network topologies subnets. For example, in one of
our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200
subnets each containing 50 hosts. In such a topology, shared
passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying
percentage of passwords were shared across subnets. The
percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early
empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords
were found to be shared.
