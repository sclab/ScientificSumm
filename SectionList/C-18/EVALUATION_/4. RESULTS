In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior
versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN
are presented. In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared
passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from
a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords. The data presented
reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes
of worm or swarm worms. The class of worms presented are
as follows:
• I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no 
learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information
with neighbors or offsprings (NS);
• S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP)
across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and
• S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and 
existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and
offsprings.
As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original
hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient
and dangerous than generic worms. In this set of 
experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of 
magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm. 
Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is
approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than
its generic counterpart.
In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.
These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample
space used for this experiment. Basically, as soon as a 
password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are
infected within a few seconds. Note that it is trivial for a
swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password
space.
In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm 
Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are
presented. In this set of simulation runs, a network 
topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly
across the IPV4 space, was constructed. Within that space,
a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed
either randomly and/or targeted to specific network 
topologies subnets. The data presented reflects the behaviors of
three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and 
two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies 
(random scanning and local bias). The amount of local bias
was varied across multiple simulation runs. The results 
presented are aggregate behaviors. In general the following
class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated.
Address Scanning:
• Random:= addresses are selected at random from a
subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224
address space;
and
• Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from
either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset
of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224
address space. The
percentage of local bias is varied across multiple runs.
Learning, Communication & Distributed Control
• I-NL-NS: Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/
memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with
neighbors or offsprings (NS);
• I-L-OOS: Generic worm, independent (I), learning/
memoryless (L), and one time sharing of information
with offsprings only (OOS);
• S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP)
across nearest neighbors and offsprings;
• S-L-S&AOP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps
list of learned passwords, and sharing of addresses with
neighbors and offsprings, shares passwords one time
only (at creation) with offsprings(SA&OP);
• S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and 
existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and
offsprings.
As it is shown in Figure 4, the results are consistent with
our set of empirical results. In addition, the following 
observations can be made.
1. Local preference is incredibly effective.
2. Short address handoffs are more effective than long
ones. We varied the size of the list allowed in the
sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a
long address list is detrimental to the performance of
the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness;
3. For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of 
susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP
swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings
328
at creation time) is more effective than sharing 
passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm. In this case,
we can think of the swarm as launching a 
distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use
different passwords to try to break into susceptible 
uninfected host. In the local bias mode, early in the life
of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than
password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered.
Then the targeting of local addresses assists in 
discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members
need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and
4. Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time
in non-local bias mode. Basically, the shared password
list across subnets has been exhausted, and the swarm
reverts to simply a random discovery of password 
algorithm.
