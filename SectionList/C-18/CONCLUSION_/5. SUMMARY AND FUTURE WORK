In this manuscript, we have presented an abstract model,
similar in some aspects to that of Weaver [5], that helps
explain the generic nature of worms. The model presented
in section 2 was extended to incorporate a new class of 
potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm
Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit
a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed
intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more 
harmful than their generic counterparts.
In addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a
learning worm was created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a 
simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates 
different learning and information sharing strategies. Such a
swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of
thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node 
topology. Preliminary results showed that such worms is capable
of compromising hosts a rates up to 2 orders of magnitude
faster than its generic counterpart while retaining stealth
capabilities.
This work opens up a new area of interesting problems.
Some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be
consider are as follows:
• Is it possible to apply some of learning concepts 
developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm
intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to
the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way
that true emergent behavior takes place?
• Are the current techniques being developed in the 
design of Intrusion Detection & CounterMeasure 
Systems and Survivable systems effective against this new
class of worms?; and
• What techniques, if any, can be developed to create
defenses against swarm worms?
