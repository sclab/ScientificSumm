The booming popularity of search engines has determined 
simple keyword search to become the only widely accepted user 
interface for seeking information over the Web. Yet keyword queries are
inherently ambiguous. The query canon book for example covers
several different areas of interest: religion, photography, literature,
and music. Clearly, one would prefer search output to be aligned
with user"s topic(s) of interest, rather than displaying a selection of
popular URLs from each category. Studies have shown that more
than 80% of the users would prefer to receive such personalized
search results [33] instead of the currently generic ones.
Query expansion assists the user in formulating a better query,
by appending additional keywords to the initial search request in
order to encapsulate her interests therein, as well as to focus the
Web search output accordingly. It has been shown to perform very
well over large data sets, especially with short input queries (see
for example [19, 3]). This is exactly the Web search scenario!
In this paper we propose to enhance Web query reformulation
by exploiting the user"s Personal Information Repository (PIR),
i.e., the personal collection of text documents, emails, cached Web
pages, etc. Several advantages arise when moving Web search 
personalization down to the Desktop level (note that by Desktop we
refer to PIR, and we use the two terms interchangeably). First is of
course the quality of personalization: The local Desktop is a rich
repository of information, accurately describing most, if not all 
interests of the user. Second, as all profile information is stored and
exploited locally, on the personal machine, another very important
benefit is privacy. Search engines should not be able to know about
a person"s interests, i.e., they should not be able to connect a 
specific person with the queries she issued, or worse, with the output
URLs she clicked within the search interface1
(see Volokh [35] for
a discussion on privacy issues related to personalized Web search).
Our algorithms expand Web queries with keywords extracted
from user"s PIR, thus implicitly personalizing the search output.
After a discussion of previous works in Section 2, we first 
investigate the analysis of local Desktop query context in Section 3.1.1.
We propose several keyword, expression, and summary based 
techniques for determining expansion terms from those personal 
documents matching the Web query best. In Section 3.1.2 we move our
analysis to the global Desktop collection and investigate expansions
based on co-occurrence metrics and external thesauri. The 
experiments presented in Section 3.2 show many of these approaches
to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing
NDCG [15] improvements of up to 51.28%. In Section 4 we move
this algorithmic framework further and propose to make the 
expansion process adaptive to the clarity level of the query. This yields
an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified
best algorithm. We conclude and discuss further work in Section 5.

Search engines can map queries at least to IP addresses, for example by
using cookies and mining the query logs. However, by moving the user
profile at the Desktop level we ensure such information is not explicitly
associated to a particular user and stored on the search engine side.
