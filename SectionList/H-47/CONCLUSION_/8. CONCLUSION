Contextual advertising is the economic engine behind a
large number of non-transactional sites on the Web. Studies
have shown that one of the main success factors for 
contextual ads is their relevance to the surrounding content. All
existing commercial contextual match solutions known to us
evolved from search advertising solutions whereby a search
query is matched to the bid phrase of the ads. A natural
extension of search advertising is to extract phrases from the
page and match them to the bid phrase of the ads. However,
individual phrases and words might have multiple meanings
and/or be unrelated to the overall topic of the page leading
to miss-matched ads.
In this paper we proposed a novel way of matching 
advertisements to web pages that rely on a topical (semantic)
match as a major component of the relevance score. The
semantic match relies on the classification of pages and ads
into a 6000 nodes commercial advertising taxonomy to 
determine their topical distance. As the classification relies
on the full content of the page, it is more robust than 
individual page phrases. The semantic match is complemented
with a syntactic match and the final score is a convex 
combination of the two sub-scores with the relative weight of
each determined by a parameter α.
We evaluated the semantic-syntactic approach against a
syntactic approach over a set of pages with different 
contextual advertising. As shown in our experimental evaluation,
the optimal value of the parameter α depends on the precise
objective of optimization (precision at particular position,
precision at given recall). However in all cases the optimal
value of α is between 0.25 and 0.9 indicating significant effect
of the semantic score component. The effectiveness of the
syntactic match depends on the quality of the pages used. In
lower quality pages we are more likely to make classification
errors that will then negatively impact the matching. We
demonstrated that it is feasible to build a large scale 
classifier that has sufficient good precision for this application.
We are currently examining how to employ machine 
learning algorithms to learn the optimal value of α based on a
collection of features of the input pages.
