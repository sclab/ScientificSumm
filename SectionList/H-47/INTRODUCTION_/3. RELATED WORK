Online advertising in general and contextual advertising
in particular are emerging areas of research. The published
literature is very sparse. A study presented in [13] confirms
the intuition that ads need to be relevant to the user"s 
interest to avoid degrading the user"s experience and increase
the probability of reaction.
A recent work by Ribeiro-Neto et. al. [8] examines a 
number of strategies to match pages to ads based on extracted
keywords. The ads and pages are represented as vectors in
a vector space. The first five strategies proposed in that
work match the pages and the ads based on the cosine of
the angle between the ad vector and the page vector. To
find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore
using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a 
basis for the ad vector. The winning strategy out of the first
five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then
ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad
sections and the page vectors.
While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space,
there is a discrepancy (impendence mismatch) between the
vocabulary used in the ads and in the pages. Furthermore,
since in the vector model the dimensions are determined
by the number of unique words, plain cosine similarity will
not take into account synonyms. To solve this problem,
Ribeiro-Neto et al expand the page vocabulary with terms
from other similar pages weighted based on the overall 
similarity of the origin page to the matched page, and show
improved matching precision.
In a follow-up work [7] the authors propose a method to
learn impact of individual features using genetic 
programming to produce a matching function. The function is 
represented as a tree composed of arithmetic operators and the log
function as internal nodes, and different numerical features
of the query and ad terms as leafs. The results show that
genetic programming finds matching functions that 
significantly improve the matching compared to the best method
(without page side expansion) reported in [8].
Another approach to contextual advertising is to reduce it
to the problem of sponsored search advertising by 
extracting phrases from the page and matching them with the bid
phrase of the ads. In [14] a system for phrase extraction is
described that used a variety of features to determine the
importance of page phrases for advertising purposes. The
system is trained with pages that have been hand 
annotated with important phrases. The learning algorithm takes
into account features based on tf-idf, html meta data and
query logs to detect the most important phrases. During
evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered
as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.
In our work we also experimented with a phrase extractor
based on the work reported in [12]. While increasing slightly
the precision, it did not change the relative performance of
the explored algorithms.
