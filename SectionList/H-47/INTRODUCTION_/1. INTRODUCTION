Web advertising supports a large swath of today"s Internet
ecosystem. The total internet advertiser spend in US alone
in 2006 is estimated at over 17 billion dollars with a growth
rate of almost 20% year over year. A large part of this
market consists of textual ads, that is, short text messages
usually marked as sponsored links or similar. The main
advertising channels used to distribute textual ads are:
1. Sponsored Search or Paid Search advertising which 
consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web
search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.
All major current web search engines (Google, Yahoo!,
and Microsoft) support such ads and act 
simultaneously as a search engine and an ad agency.
2. Contextual advertising or Context Match which refers
to the placement of commercial ads within the 
content of a generic web page. In contextual advertising
usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an
ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection
with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared 
between publisher and ad-network) and improving user
experience. Again, all major current web search 
engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) provide such
ad-networking services but there are also many smaller
players.
The SS market developed quicker than the CM market,
and most textual ads are still characterized by bid phrases
representing those queries where the advertisers would like
to have their ad displayed. (See [5] for a brief history).
However, today, almost all of the for-profit non-transactional
web sites (that is, sites that do not sell anything directly)
rely at least in part on revenue from context match. CM
supports sites that range from individual bloggers and small
niche communities to large publishers such as major 
newspapers. Without this model, the web would be a lot smaller!
The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the
advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the 
advertisement (pay-per-click or PPC). There are also other
models used: pay-per-impression, where the advertisers pay
for the number of exposures of an ad and pay-per-action
where the advertiser pays only if the ad leads to a sale or
similar transaction. For simplicity, we only deal with the
PPC model in this paper.
Given a page, rather than placing generic ads, it seems
preferable to have ads related to the content to provide a
better user experience and thus to increase the probability
of clicks. This intuition is supported by the analogy to 
conventional publishing where there are very successful 
magazines (e.g. Vogue) where a majority of the content is topical
advertising (fashion in the case of Vogue) and by user 
studies that have confirmed that increased relevance increases
the number of ad-clicks [4, 13].
Previous published approaches estimated the ad relevance
based on co-occurrence of the same words or phrases within
the ad and within the page (see [7, 8] and Section 3 for
more details). However targeting mechanisms based solely
on phrases found within the text of the page can lead to
problems: For example, a page about a famous golfer named
John Maytag might trigger an ad for Maytag 
dishwashers since Maytag is a popular brand. Another example
could be a page describing the Chevy Tahoe truck (a 
popular vehicle in US) triggering an ad about Lake Tahoe 
vacations. Polysemy is not the only culprit: there is a (maybe
apocryphal) story about a lurid news item about a headless
body found in a suitcase triggering an ad for Samsonite 
luggage! In all these examples the mismatch arises from the
fact that the ads are not appropriate for the context.
In order to solve this problem we propose a matching
mechanism that combines a semantic phase with the 
traditional keyword matching, that is, a syntactic phase. The
semantic phase classifies the page and the ads into a 
taxonomy of topics and uses the proximity of the ad and page
classes as a factor in the ad ranking formula. Hence we 
favor ads that are topically related to the page and thus avoid
the pitfalls of the purely syntactic approach. Furthermore,
by using a hierarchical taxonomy we allow for the gradual
generalization of the ad search space in the case when there
are no ads matching the precise topic of the page. For 
example if the page is about an event in curling, a rare winter
sport, and contains the words Alpine Meadows, the 
system would still rank highly ads for skiing in Alpine Meadows
as these ads belong to the class skiing which is a sibling
of the class curling and both of these classes share the
parent winter sports.
In some sense, the taxonomy classes are used to select the
set of applicable ads and the keywords are used to narrow
down the search to concepts that are of too small 
granularity to be in the taxonomy. The taxonomy contains nodes for
topics that do not change fast, for example, brands of digital
cameras, say Canon. The keywords capture the specificity
to a level that is more dynamic and granular. In the 
digital camera example this would correspond to the level of a
particular model, say Canon SD450 whose advertising life
might be just a few months. Updating the taxonomy with
new nodes or even new vocabulary each time a new model
comes to the market is prohibitively expensive when we are
dealing with millions of manufacturers.
In addition to increased click through rate (CTR) due to
increased relevance, a significant but harder to quantify 
benefit of the semantic-syntactic matching is that the resulting
page has a unified feel and improves the user experience. In
the Chevy Tahoe example above, the classifier would 
establish that the page is about cars/automotive and only those
ads will be considered. Even if there are no ads for this 
particular Chevy model, the chosen ads will still be within the
automotive domain.
To implement our approach we need to solve a challenging
problem: classify both pages and ads within a large 
taxonomy (so that the topic granularity would be small enough)
with high precision (to reduce the probability of mis-match).
We evaluated several classifiers and taxonomies and in this
paper we present results using a taxonomy with close to
6000 nodes using a variation of the Rocchio"s classifier [9].
This classifier gave the best results in both page and ad
classification, and ultimately in ad relevance.
The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we
review the basic principles of the contextual advertising.
Section 3 overviews the related work. Section 4 describes
the taxonomy and document classifier that were used for
page and ad classification. Section 5 describes the 
semanticsyntactic method. In Section 6 we briefly discuss how to
search efficiently the ad space in order to return the top-k
ranked ads. Experimental evaluation is presented in 
Section 7. Finally, Section 8 presents the concluding remarks.
