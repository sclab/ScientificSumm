P2P IR SYSTEMS
This section briefly reviews our basic approaches to 
hierarchical P2P IR systems. In a hierarchical P2P IR 
system illustrated in Fig.1, agents are connected to each other
through three types of links: upward links, downward links,
and lateral links. In the following sections, we denote the
set of agents that are directly connected to agent Ai as
DirectConn(Ai), which is defined as
DirectConn(Ai) = NEI(Ai) ∪ PAR(Ai) ∪ CHL(Ai)
, where NEI(Ai) is the set of neighboring agents connected
to Ai through lateral links; PAR(Ai) is the set of agents
whom agent Ai is connected to through upward links and
CHL(Ai) is the set of agents that agent Ai connects to
through downward links. These links are established through
a bottom-up content-similarity based distributed clustering
process[15]. These links are then used by agents to locate
other agents that contain documents relevant to the given
queries.
A typical agent Ai in our system uses two queues: a local
search queue, LSi, and a message forwarding queue MFi.
The states of the two queues constitute the internal states of
an agent. The local search queue LSi stores search sessions
that are scheduled for local processing. It is a priority queue
and agent Ai always selects the most promising queries to
process in order to maximize the global utility. MFi 
consists of a set of queries to forward on and is processed in
a FIFO (first in first out) fashion. For the first query in
MFi, agent Ai determines which subset of its neighboring
agents to forward it to based on the agent"s routing policy
πi. These routing decisions determine how the search 
process is conducted in the network. In this paper, we call Ai
as Aj"s upstream agent and Aj as Ai"s downstream agent if

an agent Ai routes a query to agent Aj.
The distributed search protocol of our hierarchical agent
organization is composed of two steps. In the first step, upon
receipt of a query qk at time tl from a user, agent Ai 
initiates a search session si by probing its neighboring agents
Aj ∈ NEI(Ai) with the message PROBE for the similarity
value Sim(qk, Aj) between qk and Aj. Here, Ai is defined as
the query initiator of search session si. In the second step,
Ai selects a group of the most promising agents to start
the actual search process with the message SEARCH. These
SEARCH messages contain a TTL (Time To Live) 
parameter in addition to the query. The TTL value decreases by 1
after each hop. In the search process, agents discard those
queries that either have been previously processed or whose
TTL drops to 0, which prevents queries from looping in the
system forever. The search session ends when all the agents
that receive the query drop it or TTL decreases to 0. Upon
receipt of SEARCH messages for qk, agents schedule local
activities including local searching, forwarding qk to their
neighbors, and returning search results to the query 
initiator. This process and related algorithms are detailed in [15,
14].
