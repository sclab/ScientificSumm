The content routing problem differs from the 
networklevel routing in packet-switched communication networks in
that content-based routing occurs in application-level 
networks. In addition, the destination agents in our 
contentrouting algorithms are multiple and the addresses are not
known in the routing process. IP-level Routing problems
have been attacked from the reinforcement learning 
perspective[2, 5, 11, 12]. These studies have explored fully
distributed algorithms that are able, without central 
coordination to disseminate knowledge about the network, to
find the shortest paths robustly and efficiently in the face of
changing network topologies and changing link costs. There
are two major classes of adaptive, distributed packet 
routing algorithms in the literature: distance-vector algorithms
and link-state algorithms. While this line of studies carry a
certain similarity with our work, it has mainly focused on
packet-switched communication networks. In this domain,
the destination of a packet is deterministic and unique. Each
agent maintains estimations, probabilistically or 
deterministically, on the distance to a certain destination through its
neighbors. A variant of Q-Learning techniques is deployed

It has been discovered that the locality property is an 
important feature of information retrieval systems in user 
modeling studies[3]. In P2P based content sharing systems, this
property is exemplified by the phenomenon that users tend
to send queries that represent only a limited number of 
topics and conversely, users in the same neighborhood are likely
to share common interests and send similar queries [10]. The
learning based approach is perceived to be more beneficial
for real distributed information retrieval systems which 
exhibit locality property. This is because the users" traffic and
query patterns can reduce the state space and speed up the
learning process. Related work in taking advantage of this
property include [7], where the authors attempted to address
this problem by user modeling techniques.
