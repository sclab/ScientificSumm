The study of non-cooperative behavior in communication 
networks, and the design of incentives, has received significant 
attention in the context of wireless ad-hoc routing. [22] considers the
problem of malicious behavior, where nodes respond positively to
route requests but then fail to forward the actual packets. It 
proposes to mitigate it by detection and report mechanisms that will
essentially help to route around the malicious nodes. However,
rather than penalizing nodes that do not forward traffic, it bypasses
the misbehaving nodes, thereby relieving their burden. Therefore,
such a mechanism is not effective against selfish behavior.
In order to mitigate selfish behavior, some approaches [7, 8, 9]
require reputation exchange between nodes, or simply first-hand
observations [5]. Other approaches propose payment schemes [10,
20, 31] to encourage cooperation. [31] is the closest to our work in
that it designs payment schemes in which the sender pays the 
intermediate nodes in order to prevent several types of selfish behavior.
In their approach, nodes are supposed to send receipts to a 
thirdparty entity. We show that this type of per-hop monitoring may not
be needed.
In the context of Internet routing, [4] proposes an accountability
framework that provide end hosts and service providers 
after-thefact audits on the fate of their packets. This proposal is part of a
broader approach to provide end hosts with greater control over the
path of their packets [3, 30]. If senders have transit cost 
information and can fully control the path of their packets, they can design
contracts that yield them with first-best utility. The accountability
framework proposed in [4] can serve two main goals: informing
nodes of network conditions to help them make informed decision,
and helping entities to establish whether individual ASs have 
performed their duties adequately. While such a framework can be
used for the first task, we propose a different approach to the 
second problem without the need of per-hop auditing information.
Research in distributed algorithmic mechanism design (DAMD)
has been applied to BGP routing [13, 14]. These works propose
mechanisms to tackle the hidden-information problem, but ignore
the problem of forwarding enforcement. Inducing desired behavior
is also the objective in [26], which attempts to respond to the 
challenge of distributed AMD raised in [15]: if the same agents that
seek to manipulate the system also run the mechanism, what 
prevents them from deviating from the mechanism"s proposed rules to
maximize their own welfare? They start with the proposed 
mechanism presented in [13] and use mostly auditing mechanisms to
prevent deviation from the algorithm.
The focus of this work is the design of a payment scheme that
provides the appropriate incentives within the context of multi-hop
routing. Like other works in this field, we assume that all the 
accounting services are done using out-of-band mechanisms. 
Security issues within this context, such as node authentication or 
message encryption, are orthogonal to the problem presented in this
paper, and can be found, for example, in [18, 19, 25].
The problem of information asymmetry and hidden-action (also
known as moral hazard) is well studied in the economics 
literature [11, 17, 23, 27]. [17] identifies the problem of moral hazard in
production teams, and shows that it is impossible to design a 
sharing rule which is efficient and budget-balanced. [27] shows that this
task is made possible when production takes place sequentially.
