DIRECTIONS
In this paper we show that in a multi-hop routing setting, where
the actions of the intermediate nodes are hidden from the source
125
and/or destination, it is possible to design payment schemes to 
induce cooperative behavior from the intermediate nodes. We 
conclude that monitoring per-hop outcomes may not improve the 
utility of the participants or the network performace. In addition, in
scenarios of unknown transit costs, it is also possible to design
mechanisms that induce cooperative behavior in equilibrium, but
the sender pays a premium for extracting information from the 
transit nodes.
Our model and results suggest several natural and intriguing 
research avenues:
• Consider manipulative or collusive behaviors which may
arise under the proposed payment schemes.
• Analyze the feasibility of recursive contracts under 
hiddeninformation of transit costs.
• While the proposed payment schemes sustain cooperation in
equilibrium, it is not a unique equilibrium. We plan to study
under what mechanisms this strategy profile may emerge as
a unique equilibrium (e.g., penalty by successor nodes).
• Consider the effect of congestion and capacity constraints on
the proposed mechanisms. Our preliminary results show that
when several senders compete for a single transit node"s 
capacity, the sender with the highest demand pays a premium
even if transit costs are common knowledge. The premium
can be expressed as a function of the second-highest demand.
In addition, if congestion affects the probability of 
successful delivery, a sender with a lower cost alternate path may
end up with a lower utility level than his rival with a higher
cost alternate path.
• Fully characterize the full-information Nash equilibrium in
first price auctions, and use this characterization to derive its
overcharging compared to truthful mechaisms.
