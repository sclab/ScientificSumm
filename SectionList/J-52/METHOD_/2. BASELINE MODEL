We consider a principal-agent model, where the principal is a
pair of communication endpoints who wish to communicate over
a multi-hop network, and the agents are the intermediate nodes
capable of forwarding packets between the endpoints. The 
principal (who in practice can be either the sender, the receiver, or
117
both) makes individual take-it-or-leave-it offers (contracts) to the
agents. If the contracts are accepted, the agents choose their 
actions sequentially to maximize their expected payoffs based on the
payment schedule of the contract. When necessary, agents can in
turn make subsequent take-it-or-leave-it offers to their downstream
agents.
We assume that all participants are risk neutral and that standard
assumptions about the global observability of the final outcome and
the enforceability of payments by guaranteeing parties hold.
For simplicity, we assume that each agent has only two possible
actions; one involving significant effort and one involving little 
effort. We denote the action choice of agent i by ai ∈ {0, 1}, where
ai = 0 and ai = 1 stand for the low-effort and high-effort actions,
respectively. Each action is associated with a cost (to the agent)
C(ai), and we assume:
C(ai = 1) > C(ai = 0)
At this stage, we assume that all nodes have the same C(ai) for
presentation clarity, but we relax this assumption later. Without loss
of generality we normalize the C(ai = 0) to be zero, and denote
the high-effort cost by c, so C(ai = 0) = 0 and C(ai = 1) = c.
The utility of agent i, denoted by ui, is a function of the payment
it receives from the principal (si), the action it takes (ai), and the
cost it incurs (ci), as follows:
ui(si, ci, ai) = si − aici
The outcome is denoted by x ∈ {xG
, xB
}, where xG
stands
for the Good outcome in which the packet reaches the 
destination, and xB
stands for the Bad outcome in which the packet
is dropped before it reaches the destination. The outcome is a
function of the vector of actions taken by the agents on the path,
a = (a1, ..., an) ∈ {0, 1}n
, and the loss rate on the channels, k.
The benefit of the sender from the outcome is denoted by w(x),
where:
w(xG
) = wG
; and w(xB
) = wB
= 0
The utility of the sender is consequently:
u(x, S) = w(x) − S
where: S =

i=1 si
A sender who wishes to induce an equilibrium in which all nodes
engage in the high-effort action needs to satisfy two constraints for
each agent i:
(IR) Individual rationality (participation constraint)1
: the 
expected utility from participation should (weakly) exceed its
reservation utility (which we normalize to 0).
(IC) Incentive compatibility: the expected utility from exerting
high-effort should (weakly) exceed its expected utility from
exerting low-effort.
In some network scenarios, the topology and costs are common
knowledge. That is, the sender knows in advance the path that its
packet will take and the costs on that path. In other routing 
scenarios, the sender does not have this a priori information. We show
that our model can be applied to both scenarios with known and 
unknown topologies and costs, and highlight the implications of each
scenario in the context of contracts. We also distinguish between
direct contracts, where the principal signs an individual contract
1We use the notion of ex ante individual rationality, in which the agents
choose to participate before they know the state of the system.

with each node, and recursive contracts, where each node enters a
contractual relationship with its downstream node.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 3
we consider agents who decide whether to drop or forward 
packets with and without monitoring when the transit costs are common
knowledge. In Section 4, we extend the model to scenarios with 
unknown transit costs. In Section 5, we distinguish between recursive
and direct contracts and discuss their relationship. In Section 6, we
show that the model applies to scenarios in which agents choose
between different levels of quality of service. We consider Internet
routing as a case study in Section 7. In Section 8 we present related
work, and Section 9 concludes the paper.
