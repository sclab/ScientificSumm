We can map different deployed and proposed Internet routing
schemes to the various models we have considered in this work.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the current inter-domain 
routing protocol in the Internet, computes routes based on path vectors.
Since the protocol reveals only the autonomous systems (AS"s)
along a route but not the cost associated to them, the current BGP
routing is best characterized by lack of a priori information about
transit costs. In this case, the principal (e.g., a multi-homed site
or a tier-1 AS) can implement one of the mechanisms proposed in
Section 4 by contracting with individual nodes on the path. Such
contracts involve paying some premium over the real cost, and it
is not clear whether recursive contacts can be implemented in this
scenario. In addition, the current protocol does not have the 
infrastructure to support implementation of direct contracts between
endpoints and the network.
Recently, several new architectures have been proposed in the
context of the Internet to provide the principal not only with a set
of paths from which it can chose (like BGP does) but also with
the performance along those paths and the network topology. One
approach to obtain such information is through end-to-end 
probing [1]. Another approach is to have the edge networks perform
measurements and discover the network topology [32]. Yet another
approach is to delegate the task of obtaining topology and 
performance information to a third-party, like in the routing-as-a-service
proposal [21]. These proposals are quite different in nature, but
they are common in their attempt to provide more visibility and
transparency into the network. If information about topology and
transit costs is obtained, the scenario is mapped to the known 
transit costs model (Section 3). In this case, first-best contracts can be
achieved through individual contracts with nodes along the path.
However, as we have shown in Section 5, as long as each agent can
chose the next hop, the principal can gain full benefit by 
contracting with only the first hop (through the implementation of recursive
contracts).
However, the various proposals for acquiring network topology
and performance information do not deal with strategic behavior
by the intermediate nodes. With the realization that the 
information collected may be used by the principal in subsequent 
contractual relationships, the intermediate nodes may behave strategically,
misrepresenting their true costs to the entities that collect and 
aggregate such information. One recent approach that can alleviate
this problem is to provide packet obituaries by having each packet
to confirm its delivery or report its last successful AS hop [4]. 
Another approach is to have third parties like Keynote independently
monitor the network performance.
