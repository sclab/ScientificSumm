5.1 Current Limitation of our Approach
The most important limitation of our current algorithm is that
the result depends on the order the data gets added. When the 
system works by itself on a fixed data set given during initialization,
the final result is equivalent to what we could obtain with a 
centralized algorithm. On the contrary, adding a new item after a first
stabilization has an impact on the final result.

of the system
To illustrate our claims, we present another example of the 
working system. By using test data and letting the system work by itself,
we obtain the hierarchy of figure 11 after stabilization.
Figure 12: Concept agent tree after taking in account 
"hepatitis"
Then, the ontologist interacts with the system and adds a new
concept described by the term "hepatitis" and linked to the root.
The system reacts and stabilizes, we then obtain figure 12 as a 
result. "hepatitis" is located in the right branch, but we have not
obtained the same organization as the figure 6 of the previous 
example. We need to improve our distributed algorithm to allow a
concept to move along a branch. We are currently working on the
required rules, but the comparison with centralized algorithm will
become very difficult. In particular since they will take into account
criteria ignored by the centralized algorithm.
5.2 Pruning for Ontologies Building
In section 3, we presented the distributed clustering algorithm
used in the Dynamo system. Since this work was first based on this
algorithm, it introduced a clear bias toward binary trees as a result.
But we have to keep in mind that we are trying to obtain taxonomies
which are more refined and concise. Although the head coverage
rule is an improvement because it is based on how the ontologists
generally work, it only addresses low level structuring but not the
intermediate levels of the tree.
By looking at figure 7, it is clear that some pruning could be
done in the taxonomy. In particular, since "l√©sion" moved, 
"ConceptAgent:9" could be removed, it is not needed anymore. 
Moreover the branch starting with "ConceptAgent:8" clearly respects the
constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the
user in a more compact and meaningful form. In this case 
"ConceptAgent:10" and "ConceptAgent:11" could probably be merged.
Currently, our system has the necessary rules to create 
intermediate levels in the taxonomy, or to have concepts shifting towards
the leaf. As we pointed, it is not enough, so new rules are needed to
allow removing nodes from the tree, or move them toward the root.
Most of the work needed to develop those rules consists in finding
the relevant statistic information that will support the ontologist.
