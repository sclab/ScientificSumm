After being presented as a promising solution, ensuring model
quality and their terminological richness, ontology building from
textual corpus analysis is difficult and costly. It requires analyst
supervising and taking in account the ontology aim. Using 
natural languages processing tools ease the knowledge localization in
texts through language uses. That said, those tools produce a huge
amount of lexical or grammatical data which is not trivial to 
examine in order to define conceptual elements. Our contribution lies in
this step of the modeling process from texts, before any attempts to
normalize or formalize the result.
We proposed an approach based on an adaptive multi-agent 
system to provide the ontologist with a first taxonomic structure of
concepts. Our system makes use of a terminological network 
resulting from an analysis made by Syntex. The current state of our
software allows to produce simple structures, to propose them to
the ontologist and to make them evolve depending on the 
modifications he made. Performances of the system are interesting and
some aspects are even comparable to their centralized counterpart.
Its strengths are mostly qualitative since it allows more subtle user
interactions and a progressive adaptation to new linguistic based
information.
From the point of view of ontology building, this work is a first
step showing the relevance of our approach. It must continue, both
to ensure a better robustness during classification, and to obtain
richer structures semantic wise than simple trees. From this 
improvements we are mostly focusing on the pruning to obtain better
taxonomies. We"re currently working on the criterion to trigger
the complementary actions of the structure changes applied by our
clustering algorithm. In other words this algorithm introduces

termediate levels, and we need to be able to remove them if 
necessary, in order to reach a dynamic equilibrium.
Also from the multi-agent engineering point of view, their use
in a dynamic ontology context has shown its relevance. This 
dynamic ontologies can be seen as complex problem solving, in such
a case self-organization through cooperation has been an efficient
solution. And, more generally it"s likely to be interesting for other
design related tasks, even if we"re focusing only on knowledge 
engineering in this paper. Of course, our system still requires more
evaluation and validation work to accurately determine the 
advantages and flaws of this approach. We"re planning to work on such
benchmarking in the near future.
