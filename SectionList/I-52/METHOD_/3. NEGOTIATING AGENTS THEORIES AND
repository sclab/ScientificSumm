REASONING MODELS
In this section we define formally the negotiating agents,
i.e. their theories, as well as the reasoning model used by
those agents in a negotiation dialogue.
3.1 Negotiating agents theories
Agents involved in a negotiation dialogue, called 
negotiating agents, are supposed to have theories. In this paper, the
theory of an agent will not refer, as usual, to its mental states
(i.e. its beliefs, desires and intentions). However, it will be
encoded in a more abstract way in terms of the arguments
owned by the agent, a conflict relation among those 
arguments, a preference relation between the arguments, and a
function that specifies which arguments support offers of the
set O. We assume that an agent is aware of all the 
arguments of the set Args(L). The agent is even able to express
a preference between any pair of arguments. This does not
mean that the agent will use all the arguments of Args(L),
but it encodes the fact that when an agent receives an 
argument from another agent, it can interpret it correctly, and it
can also compare it with its own arguments. Similarly, each
agent is supposed to be aware of the conflicts between 
arguments. This also allows us to encode the fact that an agent
can recognize whether the received argument is in conflict
or not with its arguments. However, in its theory, only the
conflicts between its own arguments are considered.
Definition 2 (Negotiating agent theory). Let O
be a set of n offers. A negotiating agent theory is a tuple
A, F, , R, Def such that:
• A ⊆ Args(L).
968 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
• F: O → 2A
s.t ∀i, j with i = j, F(oi) ∩ F(oj) = ∅.
Let AO = ∪F(oi) with i = 1, . . . , n.
• ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L) is a partial preorder denoting
a preference relation between arguments.
• R ⊆ RL such that R ⊆ A × A
• Def ⊆ A × A such that ∀ a, b ∈ A, a defeats b, denoted
a Def b iff:
- a R b, and
- not (b a)
The function F returns the arguments supporting offers in
O. In [4], it has been argued that any decision may have
arguments supporting it, called arguments PRO, and 
arguments against it, called arguments CONS. Moreover, these
two types of arguments are not necessarily conflicting. For
simplicity reasons, in this paper we consider only arguments
PRO. Moreover, we assume that an argument cannot 
support two distinct offers. However, it may be the case that an
offer is not supported at all by arguments, thus F(oi) may
be empty.
Example 1. Let O = {o1, o2, o3} be a set of offers. The
following theory is the theory of agent i:
• A = {a1, a2, a3, a4}
• F(o1) = {a1}, F(o2) = {a2}, F(o3) = ∅. Thus, Ao =
{a1, a2}
• = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a2), (a4, a3)}
• R = {a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a2), (a4, a3)}
• Def = {(a4, a3), (a3, a2)}
From the above definition of agent theory, the following hold:
Property 1.
• Def ⊆ R
• ∀a, a ∈ F(oi), a R a
3.2 The reasoning model
From the theory of an agent, one can define the 
argumentation system used by that agent for reasoning about the
offers and the arguments, i.e. for computing the status of
the different offers and arguments.
Definition 3 (Argumentation system). Let A, F,
, R, Def be the theory of an agent. The argumentation
system of that agent is the pair A, Def .
In [5], different acceptability semantics have been introduced
for computing the status of arguments. These are based
on two basic concepts, defence and conflict-free, defined as
follows:
Definition 4 (Defence/conflict-free). Let S ⊆ A.
• S defends an argument a iff each argument that defeats
a is defeated by some argument in S.
• S is conflict-free iff there exist no a, a in S such that
a Def a .
Definition 5 (Acceptability semantics). Let S be
a conflict-free set of arguments, and let T : 2A
→ 2A
be a
function such that T (S) = {a | a is defended by S}.
• S is a complete extension iff S = T (S).
• S is a preferred extension iff S is a maximal (w.r.t set
⊆) complete extension.
• S is a grounded extension iff it is the smallest (w.r.t
set ⊆) complete extension.
Let E1, . . . , Ex denote the different extensions under a given
semantics.
Note that there is only one grounded extension. It 
contains all the arguments that are not defeated, and those
arguments that are defended directly or indirectly by 
nondefeated arguments.
Theorem 1. Let A, Def the argumentation system 
defined as shown above.
1. It may have x ≥ 1 preferred extensions.
2. The grounded extensions is S = i≥1
T (∅).
Note that when the grounded extension (or the preferred
extension) is empty, this means that there is no acceptable
offer for the negotiating agent.
Example 2. In example 1, there is one preferred 
extension, E = {a1, a2, a4}.
Now that the acceptability semantics is defined, we are ready
to define the status of any argument.
Definition 6 (Argument status). Let A, Def be an
argumentation system, and E1, . . . , Ex its extensions under a
given semantics. Let a ∈ A.
1. a is accepted iff a ∈ Ei, ∀Ei with i = 1, . . . , x.
2. a is rejected iff Ei such that a ∈ Ei.
3. a is undecided iff a is neither accepted nor rejected.
This means that a is in some extensions and not in
others.
Note that A = {a|a is accepted} ∪ {a|a is rejected} ∪ {a|a
is undecided}.
Example 3. In example 1, the arguments a1, a2 and a4
are accepted, whereas the argument a3 is rejected.
As said before, agents use argumentation systems for 
reasoning about offers. In a negotiation dialogue, agents propose
and accept offers that are acceptable for them, and reject
bad ones. In what follows, we will define the status of an
offer. According to the status of arguments, one can define
four statuses of the offers as follows:
Definition 7 (Offers status). Let o ∈ O.
• The offer o is acceptable for the negotiating agent iff
∃ a ∈ F(o) such that a is accepted. Oa = {oi ∈ O,
such that oi is acceptable}.
• The offer o is rejected for the negotiating agent iff ∀
a ∈ F(o), a is rejected. Or = {oi ∈ O, such that oi is
rejected}.
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 969
• The offer o is negotiable iff ∀ a ∈ F(o), a is undecided.
On = {oi ∈ O, such that oi is negotiable}.
• The offer o is non-supported iff it is neither 
acceptable, nor rejected or negotiable. Ons = {oi ∈ O, such
that oi is non-supported offers}.
Example 4. In example 1, the two offers o1 and o2 are
acceptable since they are supported by accepted arguments,
whereas the offer o3 is non-supported since it has no 
argument in its favor.
From the above definitions, the following results hold:
Property 2. Let o ∈ O.
• O = Oa ∪ Or ∪ On ∪ Ons.
• The set Oa may contain more than one offer.
From the above partition of the set O of offers, a preference
relation between offers is defined. Let Ox and Oy be two
subsets of O. Ox Oy means that any offer in Ox is 
preferred to any offer in the set Oy. We can write also for two
offers oi, oj, oi oj iff oi ∈ Ox, oj ∈ Oy and Ox Oy.
Definition 8 (Preference between offers). Let O
be a set of offers, and Oa, Or, On, Ons its partition. Oa
On Ons Or.
Example 5. In example 1, we have o1 o3, and o2 o3.
However, o1 and o2 are indifferent.
