THEORIES
In this section, we study the properties of the system 
developed above. We first show that in the particular case
where A = AO (ie. all of the agent"s arguments refer to
offers), the corresponding argumentation system will return
at least one non-empty preferred extension.
Theorem 2. Let A, Def an argumentation system such
that A = AO. Then the system returns at least one 
extension E, such that |E| ≥ 1.
We now present some results that demonstrate the 
importance of indifference in negotiating agents, and more 
specifically its relation to acceptable outcomes. We first show that
the set Oa may contain several offers when their 
corresponding accepted arguments are indifferent w.r.t the preference
relation .
Theorem 3. Let o1, o2 ∈ O. o1, o2 ∈ Oa iff ∃ a1 ∈
F(o1), ∃ a2 ∈ F(o2), such that a1 and a2 are accepted and
are indifferent w.r.t (i.e. a b and b a).
We now study acyclic preference relations that are defined
formally as follows.
Definition 9 (Acyclic relation). A relation R on
a set A is acyclic if there is no sequence a1, a2, . . . , an ∈ A,
with n > 1, such that (ai, ai+1) ∈ R and (an, a1) ∈ R, with
1 ≤ i < n.
Note that acyclicity prohibits pairs of arguments a, b such
that a b and b a, ie., an acyclic preference relation
disallows indifference.
Theorem 4. Let A be a set of arguments, R the 
attacking relation of A defined as R ⊆ A × A, and an acyclic
relation on A. Then for any pair of arguments a, b ∈ A,
such that (a, b) ∈ R, either (a, b) ∈ Def or (b, a) ∈ Def (or
both).
The previous result is used in the proof of the following
theorem that states that acyclic preference relations 
sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
Theorem 5. Let A be a set of arguments, and an
acyclic relation on A. If E is an extension of <A, Def>,
then |E ∩ AO| = 1.
An immediate consequence of the above is the following.
Property 3. Let A be a set of arguments such that A =
AO. If the relation on A is acyclic, then each extension
Ei of <A, Def>, |Ei| = 1.
Another direct consequence of the above theorem is that
in acyclic preference relations, arguments that support offers
can participate in only one preferred extension.
Theorem 6. Let A be a set of arguments, and an
acyclic relation on A. Then the preferred extensions of
A, Def are pairwise disjoint w.r.t arguments of AO.
Using the above results we can prove the main theorem of
this section that states that negotiating agents with acyclic
preference relations do not have acceptable offers.
Theorem 7. Let A, F, R, , Def be a negotiating
agent such that A = AO and is an acyclic relation. Then
the set of accepted arguments w.r.t A, Def is emtpy. 
Consequently, the set of acceptable offers, Oa is empty as well.
