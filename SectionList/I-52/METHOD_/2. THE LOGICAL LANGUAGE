In what follows, L will denote a logical language, and ≡
is an equivalence relation associated with it.
From L, a set O = {o1, . . . , on} of n offers is identified, such
that oi, oj ∈ O such that oi ≡ oj. This means that the
offers are different. Offers correspond to the different 
alternatives that can be exchanged during a negotiation dialogue.
For instance, if the agents try to decide the place of their
next meeting, then the set O will contain different towns.
Different arguments can be built from L. The set Args(L)
will contain all those arguments. By argument, we mean a
reason in believing or of doing something. In [3], it has been
argued that the selection of the best offer to propose at a
given step of the dialogue is a decision problem. In [4], it has
been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for
decision making, two kinds of arguments are distinguished:
arguments supporting choices (or decisions), and arguments
supporting beliefs. Moreover, it has been acknowledged that
the two categories of arguments are formally defined in 
different ways, and they play different roles. Indeed, an 
argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agent"s 
beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an 
argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries
to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs
part of those decision arguments. Consequently, in a 
negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally
exchanged between agents. In what follows, the set Args(L)
is then divided into two subsets: a subset Argso(L) of 
arguments supporting offers, and a subset Argsb(L) of arguments
supporting beliefs. Thus, Args(L) = Argso(L) ∪ Argsb(L).
As in [5], in what follows, we consider that the structure of
the arguments is not known.
Since the knowledge bases from which arguments are built
may be inconsistent, the arguments may be conflicting too.
In what follows, those conflicts will be captured by the 
relation RL, thus RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L). Three assumptions
are made on this relation: First the arguments supporting
different offers are conflicting. The idea behind this 
assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose
only one at a given step of the dialogue. Note that, the
relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the 
arguments of Argsb(L). The second hypothesis says that 
arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting. The
idea here is to return the strongest argument among these
arguments. The third condition does not allow an argument
in favor of an offer to attack an argument supporting a 
belief. This avoids wishful thinking. Formally:
Definition 1. RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L) is a conflict
relation among arguments such that:
• ∀a, a ∈ Argso(L), s.t. a = a , a RL a
• a ∈ Argso(L) and a ∈ Argsb(L) such that a RL a
Note that the relation RL is not symmetric. This is due
to the fact that arguments of Argsb(L) may be conflicting
but not necessarily in a symmetric way. In what follows, we
assume that the set Args(L) of arguments is finite, and each
argument is attacked by a finite number of arguments.
