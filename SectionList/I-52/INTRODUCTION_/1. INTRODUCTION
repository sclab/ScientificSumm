Roughly speaking, negotiation is a process aiming at 
finding some compromise or consensus between two or several
agents about some matters of collective agreement, such
as pricing products, allocating resources, or choosing 
candidates. Negotiation models have been proposed for the
design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with
other agents for example, buying or selling products in 
ecommerce.
Different approaches to automated negotiation have been
investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which 
usually assume complete information and unlimited 
computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try
to cope with these limitations [6], and argumentation-based
approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the 
importance of exchanging information and explanations between
negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their 
behaviors (e.g. an agent may concede a goal having a small
priority), and consequently the outcome of the dialogue. 
Indeed, the two first types of settings do not allow for the 
addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers.
Integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a
good means for supplying additional information and also
helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments
during a negotiation dialogue. Indeed, an offer supported
by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by
an agent, and can also make him reveal his goals or give
up some of them. The basic idea behind an 
argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments, the 
theories of the agents (i.e. their mental states) may evolve, and
consequently, the status of offers may change. For instance,
an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for
it. However, the agent may change its mind if it receives a
strong argument in favor of this offer.
Several proposals have been made in the literature for
modeling such an approach. However, the work is still 
preliminary. Some researchers have mainly focused on relating
argumentation with protocols. They have shown how and
when arguments in favor of offers can be computed and 
exchanged. Others have emphasized on the decision making
problem. In [3, 7], the authors argued that selecting an offer
to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision 
making problem. They have thus proposed an 
argumentationbased decision model, and have shown how such a model
can be related to the dialogue protocol.
In most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis
of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues. It is
not clear how argumentation can influence the outcome of
the dialogue. Moreover, basic concepts in negotiation such
as agreement (i.e. optimal solutions, or compromise) and
concession are neither defined nor studied.
This paper aims to propose a unified and general framework
for argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of
argumentation is formally analyzed, and where the existing
systems can be restated. In this framework, a negotiation
dialogue takes place between two agents on a set O of offers,
whose structure is not known. The goal of a negotiation is to
find among elements of O, an offer that satisfies more or less

the preferences of both agents. Each agent is supposed to
have a theory represented in an abstract way. A theory 
consists of a set A of arguments whose structure and origin are
not known, a function specifying for each possible offer in O,
the arguments of A that support it, a non specified conflict
relation among the arguments, and finally a preference 
relation between the arguments. The status of each argument is
defined using Dung"s acceptability semantics. Consequently,
the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets: acceptable,
rejected, negotiable and non-supported offers. We show how
an agent"s theory may evolve during a negotiation dialogue.
We define formally the notions of concession, compromise,
and optimal solution. Then, we propose a protocol that 
allows agents i) to exchange offers and arguments, and ii) to
make concessions when necessary. We show that dialogues
generated under such a protocol terminate, and even reach
optimal solutions when they exist.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the
logical language that is used in the rest of the paper. 
Section 3 defines the agents as well as their theories. In section
4, we study the properties of these agents" theories. 
Section 5 defines formally an argumentation-based negotiation,
shows how the theories of agents may evolve during a 
dialogue, and how this evolution may influence the outcome of
the dialogue. Two kinds of outcomes: optimal solution and
compromise are defined, and we show when such outcomes
are reached. Section 6 illustrates our general framework
through some examples. Section 7 compares our formalism
with existing ones. Section 8 concludes and presents some
perspectives. Due to lack of space, the proofs are not 
included. These last are in a technical report that we will
make available online at some later time.
