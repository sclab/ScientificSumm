In this paper we have presented a unified and general
framework for argumentation-based negotiation. Like any
other argumentation-based negotiation framework, as it is
evoked in (e.g. [10]), our framework has all the advantages
that argumentation-based negotiation approaches present
when related to the negotiation approaches based either on
game theoretic models (see e.g. [11]) or heuristics ([6]). This
work is a first attempt to formally define the role of 
argumentation in the negotiation process. More precisely, for the
first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between
the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it
defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences
the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the 
theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an
analysis of the negotiation outcomes. It is also the first time
where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation
theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative 
negotiation dialogue is presented.
Our future work concerns several points. A first point is
to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the
same to both agents. Indeed, it is more natural to assume
that agents may have different sets of offers. During a 
negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve. Arguments in favor
of the new offers may be built from the agent theory. Thus,
the set of offers will be part of the agent theory. Another
possible extension of this work would be to allow agents
to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers. This is
more akin to the way human take decisions. Considering
both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the
offers status. In the proposed model, a preference relation
between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the
set of offers. This preference relation can be refined. For
instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the
offer that is supported by the strongest argument. In [4], 
different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions.
Our framework can thus be extended by integrating those
criteria. Another interesting point to investigate is that of
considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with
different profiles. By profile, we mean the criterion used by
an agent to compare its offers.
