Argumentation has been integrated in negotiation 
dialogues at the early nineties by Sycara [12]. In that work, the
author has emphasized the advantages of using 
argumentation in negotiation dialogues, and a specific framework has
been introduced. In [8], the different types of arguments
that are used in a negotiation dialogue, such as threats and
rewards, have been discussed. Moreover, a particular 
framework for negotiation have been proposed. In [9, 13], 
different other frameworks have been proposed. Even if all these
frameworks are based on different logics, and use different
definitions of arguments, they all have at their heart an 
exchange of offers and arguments. However, none of those
proposals explain when arguments can be used within a 
negotiation, and how they should be dealt with by the agent
that receives them. Thus the protocol for handling 
arguments was missing. Another limitation of the above 
frameworks is the fact that the argumentation frameworks they

use are quite poor, since they use a very simple 
acceptability semantics. In [2] a negotiation framework that fills the
gap has been suggested. A protocol that handles the 
arguments was proposed. However, the notion of concession
is not modeled in that framework, and it is not clear what
is the status of the outcome of the dialogue. Moreover, it
is not clear how an agent chooses the offer to propose at a
given step of the dialogue. In [1, 7], the authors have 
focused mainly on this decision problem. They have proposed
an argumentation-based decision framework that is used by
agents in order to choose the offer to propose or to accept
during the dialogue. In that work, agents are supposed to
have a beliefs base and a goals base.
Our framework is more general since it does not impose
any specific structure for the arguments, the offers, or the 
beliefs. The negotiation protocol is general as well. Thus this
framework can be instantiated in different ways by creating,
in such manner, different specific argumentation-based 
negotiation frameworks, all of them respecting the same 
properties. Our framework is also a unified one because frameworks
like the ones presented above can be represented within this
framework. For example the decision making mechanism
proposed in [7] for the evaluation of arguments and 
therefore of offers, which is based on a priority relation between
mutually attacked arguments, can be captured by the 
relation defeat proposed in our framework. This relation takes
simultaneously into account the attacking and preference
relations that may exist between two arguments.
