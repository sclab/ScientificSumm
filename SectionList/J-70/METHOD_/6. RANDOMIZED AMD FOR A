SELFINTERESTED DESIGNER IS EASY
We now show how allowing for randomization over the
outcomes makes the problem of self-interested AMD tractable
through linear programming, for any constant number of
agents.
Theorem 3. Self-interested randomized AMD with a 
constant number of agents is solvable in polynomial time by 
linear programming, both with and without payments, both for
ex post and ex interim IR, and both for implementation in
dominant strategies and for implementation in Bayes-Nash
equilibrium-even if the types are correlated.
Proof. Because linear programs can be solved in 
polynomial time [13], all we need to show is that the number of
variables and equations in our program is polynomial for any
constant number of agents-that is, exponential only in N.
Throughout, for purposes of determining the size of the 
linear program, let T = maxi{|Θi|}. The variables of our linear
program will be the probabilities (p(θ1, θ2, . . . , θN ))(o) (at
most TN
|O| variables) and the payments πi(θ1, θ2, . . . , θN )
(at most NTN
variables). (We show the linear program for
the case where payments are possible; the case without 
payments is easily obtained from this by simply omitting all the
payment variables in the program, or by adding additional
constraints forcing the payments to be 0.)
First, we show the IR constraints. For ex post IR, we add
the following (at most NTN
) constraints to the LP:
• For every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}, and for every (θ1, θ2, . . . , θN )
∈ Θ1 × Θ2 × . . . × ΘN , we add
(
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, . . . , θN ))(o)u(θi, o)) − πi(θ1, θ2, . . . , θN ) ≥ 0.
For ex interim IR, we add the following (at most NT)
constraints to the LP:
• For every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}, for every θi ∈ Θi, we add
θ1,... ,θN
γ(θ1, . . . , θN |θi)((
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, . . . , θN ))(o)u(θi, o))−
πi(θ1, θ2, . . . , θN )) ≥ 0.
Now, we show the solution concept constraints. For 
implementation in dominant strategies, we add the following
(at most NTN+1
) constraints to the LP:
• For every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}, for every
(θ1, θ2, . . . , θi, . . . , θN ) ∈ Θ1 × Θ2 × . . . × ΘN , and for every
alternative type report ˆθi ∈ Θi, we add the constraint
(
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, . . . , θi, . . . , θN ))(o)u(θi, o)) −
πi(θ1, θ2, . . . , θi, . . . , θN ) ≥
(
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, . . . , ˆθi, . . . , θN ))(o)u(θi, o)) −
πi(θ1, θ2, . . . , ˆθi, . . . , θN ).
Finally, for implementation in Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we
add the following (at most NT2
) constraints to the LP:
• For every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}, for every θi ∈ Θi, and for
every alternative type report ˆθi ∈ Θi, we add the constraint
θ1,...,θN
γ(θ1, ..., θN |θi)((
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, ..., θi, ..., θN ))(o)u(θi, o))
− πi(θ1, θ2, ..., θi, ..., θN )) ≥
θ1,...,θN
γ(θ1, ..., θN |θi)((
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, ..., ˆθi, ..., θN ))(o)u(θi, o))
− πi(θ1, θ2, ..., ˆθi, ..., θN )).
All that is left to do is to give the expression the designer
is seeking to maximize, which is:
•
θ1,...,θN
γ(θ1, ..., θN )((
o∈O
(p(θ1, θ2, ..., θi, ..., θN ))(o)g(o))
+
N
i=1
πi(θ1, θ2, ..., θN )).
As we indicated, the number of variables and constraints
is exponential only in N, and hence the linear program is of
polynomial size for constant numbers of agents. Thus the
problem is solvable in polynomial time.
