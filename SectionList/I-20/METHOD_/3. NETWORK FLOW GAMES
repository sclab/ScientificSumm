3.1 Motivation
Consider a communication network, where it is crucial to be able
to send a certain amount of information between two sites. Given
limited resources to maintain network links, which edges should
get those resources?
2
Banzhaf actually considered the percentage of such coalitions out
of all winning coalitions. This is called the normalized Banzhaf
index.
We model this problem by considering a network flow game. The
game consists of agents in a network flow graph, with a certain
source vertex s and target vertex t. Each agent controls one of the
graph"s edges, and a coalition of agents controls all the edges its
members control. A coalition of agents wins the game if it manages
to send a flow of at least k from source s to target t, and loses
otherwise.
To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired
flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited 
maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on 
allowing this flow. In other words, resources could be devoted to the
links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to
send the required amount of information between the source and
target.
Under a reasonable probabilistic model, the Banzhaf index 
provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling
this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus
provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance
resources.
3.2 Formal Definition
Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows. The game
consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on
the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I
of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei. Given a coalition C,
which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether
the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple
coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition
wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise:
v(C) =
1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t;
0 otherwise;
A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity
game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path
from source to target. More precisely, a connectivity game is a
network flow game where each of the edges has identical capacity,
c(e) = 1, and the target flow value is k = 1. In such a scenario,
the goal of a coalition is to have at least one path from s to t:
v(C) =
1 if EC contains a path from s to t;
0 otherwise;
Given a network flow game (or a connectivity game), we can
compute the power indices of the game. When a coalition of edges
is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the 
appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3
We can use the Banzhaf value
of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to
measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t.
