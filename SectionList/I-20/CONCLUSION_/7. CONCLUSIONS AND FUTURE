We have considered network flow games, where a coalition of
agents wins if it manages to send a flow of more than some value k
between two vertices. We have assessed the relative power of each
agent in this scenario using the Banzhaf index. This power index
may be used to decide how to allocate maintenance resources in
real-world networks, in order to maximize our ability to maintain a
certain flow of information between two sites.
Although the Banzhaf index theoretically allows us to measure
the power of the agents in the network flow game, we have shown
that the problem of calculating the Banzhaf index in this domain
in #P-complete. Despite this discouraging result for the general
network flow domain, we have also provided a more encouraging
result for a restricted domain. In the case of connectivity games
(where it is only required for a coalition to contain a path from
the source to the destination) played on bounded layer graphs, it is
possible to calculate the Banzhaf index of an agent in polynomial
time.
It remains an open problem to find ways to tractably 
approximate the Banzhaf index in the general network flow domain. It
might also be possible to find other useful restricted domains where
it is possible to exactly calculate the Banzhaf index. We have only
considered the complexity of calculating the Banzhaf index; it 
remains an open problem to find the complexity of calculating the
Shapley-Shubik or other indices in the network flow domain. 
Finally, we believe that there are many additional interesting domains
other than weighted voting games and network flow games, and it
would be worthwhile to investigate the complexity of calculating
the Banzhaf index or other power indices in such domains.
