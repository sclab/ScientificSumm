Measuring the power of individual players in coalitional games
has been studied for many years. The most popular indices 
suggested for such measurement are the Banzhaf index [1] and the
Shapley-Shubik index [19].
In his seminal paper, Shapley [18] considered coalitional games
and the fair allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition
(the coalition of all agents) to its members. The Shapley-Shubik
index [19] is the direct application of the Shapley value to simple
coalitional games.
The Banzhaf index emerged directly from the study of voting in
decision-making bodies. The normalized Banzhaf index measures
the proportion of coalitions in which a player is a swinger, out of
all winning coalitions. This index is similar to the Banzhaf index
discussed in Section 1, and is defined as:
βi =
βi(v)
k∈N βk
.
The Banzhaf index was mathematically analyzed in [3], where
it was shown that this normalization lacks certain desirable 
properties, and the more natural Banzhaf index is introduced.
Both the Shapley-Shubik and the Banzhaf indices have been widely
studied, and Straffin [20] has shown that each index reflects specific
conditions in a voting body. [11] considers these two indices along
with several others, and describes the axioms that characterize the
different indices.
The naive implementation of an algorithm for calculating the
Banzhaf index of an agent i enumerates all coalitions containing
i. There are 2n−1
such coalitions, so the performance is 
exponential in the number of agents. [12] contains a survey of algorithms
for calculating power indices of weighted majority games. Deng
and Papadimitriou [2] show that computing the Shapley value in
weighted majority games is #P-complete, using a reduction from
KNAPSACK. Since the Shapley value of any simple game has the
same value as its Shapley-Shubik index, this shows that 
calculating the Shapley-Shubik index in weighted majority games is 
#Pcomplete.
Matsui and Matsui [13] have shown that calculating both the
Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices in weighted voting games is
NP-complete.
The problem of computing power indices in simple games 
depends on the chosen representation of the game. Since the number
of possible coalitions is exponential in the number of agents, 
calculating power indices in time polynomial in the number of agents
can only be achieved in specific domains.
In this paper, we have considered the network flow domain, where
a coalition of agents must achieve a flow beyond a certain value.
The network flow game we have defined is a simple game. [10, 9]
have considered a similar network flow domain, where each agent
controls an edge of a network flow graph. However, they 
introduced a non-simple game, where the value a coalition of agents
achieves is the maximal total flow. They have shown that certain
families of network flow games and similar games have nonempty
cores.
