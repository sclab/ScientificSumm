Compared with traditional DR, GS-DR can eliminate after
inconsistency through the synchronization of physical clocks, but
it cannot tackle before inconsistency, which would significantly
influence the usability and fairness of a game. In this paper, we
proposed a method named GS-DR-LL, which combines local lag
and GS-DR, to decrease before inconsistency through delaying
updating the execution results of local operations to local scene.
Performance evaluation indicates that GS-DR-LL can effectively
decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the
lag.
GS-DR-LL has significant implications to consistency
maintenance approaches. First, GS-DR-LL shows that improved
DR can not only eliminate after inconsistency but also decrease

before inconsistency, with proper lag and threshold, it would even
eliminate before inconsistency. As a result, the application of DR
can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems
which request high consistency (e.g. highly interactive games).
Second, GS-DR-LL shows that by combining local lag and 
GSDR, the constraint on selecting lag value is removed and a lag,
which is smaller than typical network transmission delay, could
be used. As a result, the application of local lag can be greatly
broadened and it could be used in the systems which have large
typical network transmission delay (e.g. Internet based games).
