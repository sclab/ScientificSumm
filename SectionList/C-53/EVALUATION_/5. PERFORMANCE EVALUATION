In order to evaluate GS-DR-LL and compare it with GS-DR in a
real application, we had implemented both two methods in a
networked game named spaceship [1]. Spaceship is a very simple
networked computer game, in which players can control their
spaceships to accelerate, decelerate, turn, and shoot spaceships
controlled by remote players with laser beams. If a spaceship is
hit by a laser beam, its life points decrease one. If the life points
of a spaceship decrease to 0, the spaceship is removed from the
game and the player controlling the spaceship loses the game.
In our practical implementation, GS-DR-LL and GS-DR
coexisted in the game system, and the test bed was composed of
two computers connected by 100 M switched Ethernet, with one
computer acted as local site and the other acted as remote site. In
order to simulate network transmission delay, a specific module
was developed to delay all packets transmitted between the two
computers in terms of a predefined delay value.
The main purpose of performance evaluation is to study the
effects of GS-DR-LL on decreasing before inconsistency in a
particular game system under different thresholds, lags, and
network transmission delays. Two different thresholds were used
in the evaluation, one is 10 pixels deviation in position or 15
degrees deviation in orientation, and the other is 4 pixels or 5
degrees. Six different combinations of lag and network
transmission delay were used in the evaluation and they could be
divided into two categories. In one category, the lag was fixed at
300 ms and three different network transmission delays (100 ms,
300 ms, and 500 ms) were used. In the other category, the
network transmission delay was fixed at 800 ms and three
different lags (100 ms, 300 ms, and 500 ms) were used. Therefore
the total number of settings used in the evaluation was 12 (2 Ã— 6).
The procedure of performance evaluation was composed of three
steps. In the first step, two participants were employed to play the
game, and the operation sequences were recorded. Based on the
records, a sub operation sequence, which lasted about one minute
and included different operations (e.g. accelerate, decelerate, and
turn), was selected. In the second step, the physical clocks of the
two computers were synchronized first. Under different settings
and consistency maintenance approaches, the selected sub
operation sequence was played back on one computer, and it
drove the two spaceships, one was local and the other was remote,
to move. Meanwhile, the tracks of the spaceships on the two
computers were recorded separately and they were called as a
track couple. Since there are 12 settings and 2 consistency
maintenance approaches, the total number of recorded track
couples was 24. In the last step, to each track couple, the
inconsistency between them was calculated, and the unit of
inconsistency was pixel. Since the physical clocks of the two
computers were synchronized, the calculation of inconsistency
was quite simple. The inconsistency at a particular time point was
the distance between the positions of the two spaceships at that
time point (i.e. formula (3)).
In order to show the results of inconsistency in a clear way, only
parts of the results, which last about 7 seconds, are used in the
following figures, and the figures show almost the same parts of
the results. Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the results of inconsistency
when the lag is fixed at 300 ms and the network transmission
delays are 100, 300, and 500 ms. It can been seen that
inconsistency does exist, but in most of the time it is 0.
Additionally, inconsistency increases with the network
transmission delay, but decreases with the threshold. Compared
with GS-DR, GS-DR-LL can decrease more inconsistency, and it
eliminates most inconsistency when the network transmission
delay is 100 ms and the threshold is 4 pixels or 5 degrees.

According to the prediction and state filtering mechanisms of DR,
inconsistency cannot be completely eliminated if the threshold is
not 0. With the definitions of before inconsistency and after
inconsistency, it can be indicated that GS-DR and GS-DR-LL
both can eliminate after inconsistency, and GS-DR-LL can
effectively decrease before inconsistency. It can be foreseen that
with proper lag and threshold (e.g. the lag is larger than the
network transmission delay and the threshold is 0), GS-DR-LL
even can eliminate before inconsistency.

Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the results of inconsistency when the
network transmission delay is fixed at 800 ms and the lag are 100,
300, and 500 ms. It can be seen that with GS-DR-LL before
inconsistency decreases with the lag. In traditional local lag, the
lag must be set to a value larger than typical network transmission
delay, otherwise the state repairs would flood the system. From
the above results it can be seen that there does not exist any
constraint on the selection of the lag, with GS-DR-LL a system
would work fine even if the lag is much smaller than the network
transmission delay.

From all above results, it can be indicated that GS-DR and 
GSDR-LL both can eliminate after inconsistency, and GS-DR-LL
can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects
increase with the lag.
