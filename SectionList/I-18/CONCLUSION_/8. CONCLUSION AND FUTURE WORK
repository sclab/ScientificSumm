An observation satellite swarm is a cooperative 
multiagent system with strong constraints in terms of 
communication and computation capabilities. In order to increase
the global mission outcome, we propose an hybrid approach:
deliberative for individual planning and reactive for 
collaboration.
Agents reason both on requests to carry out and on the
other agents" intentions (candidacies). An epidemic 
communication protocol uses all communication opportunities
to update this information. Reactive decision rules 
(strategies) are proposed to solve conflicts that may arise between
agents. Through the tuning of the strategies (α, and λ)
and their plastic interlacing within the protocol, it is 
possible to coordinate agents without additional communication:
the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same
between informed simulations and simulations implementing
strategies.
Some simulations have been made to experimentally 
validate these protocols and the first results are promising but
raise many questions. What is the trade-off between the
constraint rate of the problem and the need of strategies?
To what extent are the number of redundancies and the 
average cost affected by the tuning of the strategies?
Future works will focus on new strategies to solve new
conflicts, specially those arising when relaxing the 
independence assumption between the requests. A second point is
to take into account the complexity of the initial planning
problem. Indeed, the chosen planning approach results in a
combinatory explosion with big sets of requests: an anytime
or a fully reactive approach has to be considered for more
complex problems.
