5.1 Temporal sensitivity
Considering a flow with temporal loss sensitivity, paragraph
3.1.1 has shown that a simple, periodic loss pattern enhances
the performance of the end-to-end loss recovery. The pattern
is not tied to particular packets, therefore a per-flow 
characterization with the introduced metrics is applicable. In this
paragraph we assume that a flow expressed its temporal 
se*sitivity by marking its flow with an alternating pattern of

burst loss length rates as a function of burst length burst, loss length rates as a function of burst length
k: three state run-length-based model k: two state run-length-based model (Gilbert.)
Figures 11 and 12 show the rates for the actual and the 
estimated burst loss lengths for a three-state (m = 2) and a
two=state (m = 1, Gilbert) model respectively6. We can
observe that DiffRED shapes the burst probability curve in
the desired way. Most of the probability mass is 
concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the
occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be 
expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).
With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing
burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4)
is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large
though. Thus, considering voice with temporal loss 
sensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a
large number of short annoying bursts can be traded against
a larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts
(which occur when the queue is under temporary overload,
i.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10).
We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) 
reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop
of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along
a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2). This effect
cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which
thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and
then hugely underestimates it for k > 2. Interestingly, for
Drop Tail, while both models capture the shape of the 
actual curve, the lower order model is more accurate in the
estimation. This can be explained as follows: if the burst
loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical 
distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included
(note that the run-length based approximation of the 
conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss
run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1).
sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an
example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs
and to show how loss models can capture this performance.
Details on the simulation scenario and parameters can be
found in [12].
5.2 Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity
In paragraph 3.1.2 we have seen that sensitivity to ADU
heterogeneity results in a certain non-periodic loss pattern.
Thus, a mechanism at (or near) the sender is necessary
which derives that pattern from the voice data. 
Furthermore, an explicit cooperation between end-to-end and hop
by-hop mechanisms is necessary (Fig. 4).
We use the result of paragraph 3.2 to develop a new packet
marking scheme called Speech Property-Based Selective 
Differential Packet Marking (SPB-DIFFMARK). The 
DIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority packets on
the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the
decoder"s concealment for other frames.
Figure 13 shows the simple algorithm written in a 
pseudocode that is used to detect an unvoiced/voiced (uw) 
transition and protect the voiced frames at, the beginning of a
voiced signal. The procedure analysis0 is used to classify
a block of Ic frames as voiced, unvoiced, or uv transition.
send0 is used to send a block of Ic frames as a single packet
with the appropriate priority (either fl, 0 or -1).
As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision
(protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm
to send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5):
after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding
number of -1 packets is sent immediately. State about the
necessary number of to-be-sent -1 packets is kept in the
event that the SPB algorithm triggers the next +l burst
before all -1 packets necessary for compensation are sent.
Thus, seen over time intervals which are long compared to
the +1/-l burst times, the mean loss for the flow will be
equal to the best effort case (Eq. 5). N is a pre-defined
value and defines how many frames at the beginning of a
voiced signal are to be protected. Our simulations (Fig. 9)
have shown that the range from 10 to 20 are appropriate
values for N (depending on the network loss condition). In
the simulations presented below, we choose Ic = 2, a typical

(20ms of audio data per packet). A larger number of Ic would
help to reduce the relative overhead of the protocol header
but also increases the packetization delay and makes sender
classification and receiver concealment in case of packet loss
(due to a larger loss gap) more difficult.
5.2.1 En.d-to-end simulation description
Due to the non-periodic loss pattern, we need to explicitly
associate a drop probability with a single packet within an
end-to-end model. Therefore we use a separate one-state
Markov model (Bernouilli model) to describe the network
behaviour as seen by each class of packets. Best effort
packets (designated by 0 in Fig. 14) are dropped with the
probability pc, whereas packets marked with +l and -1
are dropped with probabilities of p+i and p-1 respectively.
This is a reasonable assumption" with regard to the 
interdependence of the different classes in fact, as it has been shown
that DiffRED (Figs. 11 and 12) achieves a fair amount of
decorrelation of +l and -1 packet losses. Nevertheless to
include some correlation between the classes we have set
p+i = 10m3 pc for the subsequent simulations. This should
‘The appropriateness of the simple end-to-end modeling
used has been investigated in [12] with discrete event 
simulation using a multi-hop topology and detailed modeling of
foreground and background traffic sources.

also allow a reasonable evaluation of how losses in the fl
class affect the performance of the SPB-algorithms.
For a direct comparison with SPB-DIFFMARK, we evaluate
a scheme where packets are alternatingly marked as being
either -1 or +l (ALT-DIFFMARK, Figure 14). We 
furthermore include related inter-flow loss protection schemes.
The first scheme uses full protection (FULL MARK, all
packets are marked as +l). The SPB-MARK scheme 
operates similarly to SPB-DIFFMARK, but no -1 packets
are sent for compensation (those packets are also marked as
0). For comparison we again use a scheme where 
packets are alternatingly marked as being either 0 or +l
(ALT-MARK). Finally, packets of pure best effort flows
are dropped with the probability po (NO MARK case in
Fig. 14). For the SPB marking schemes the percentage of
+l- and -l-marked packets respectively is 40.4% for the
speech material used. We obtained similar marking 
percentages for other speech samples. The ALT marking schemes
mark exactly 50% of their packets as being fl.
5.2.2 Results
Figure 15 shows the perceptual distortion for the marking
schemes dependent on the drop probability pc. The 
unprotected case (NO MARK) has the highest perceptual 
distortion and thus the worst speech quality*. The differential
marking scheme (SPB-DIFFMARK) offers a significantly
better speech quality even when only using a network 
service which amounts to best effort in the long term. Note
that the ALT-DIFFMARK marking strategy does not 
differ from the best effort case (which confirms the result of
paragraph 3.1.2). SPB-DIFFMARK is also even better than
the inter-flow QoS ALT-MARK scheme, especially for higher
values of pe. These results validate the strategy of our SPB
marking schemes that do not equally mark all packets with a
higher priority but rather protect a subset of frames that are
essential to the speech quality. The SPB-FEC scheme ([12]),
*We have also perfo rmed informal listening tests which 
confirmed the results using the objective metrics.

Figure 15: Perceptual Distortion (EMBSD) for the
marking schemes and SPB-FEC
which uses redundancy9 piggybacked on the main payload
packets (RFC 2198, [7]) to protect a subset of the packets,
enables a very good output speech quality for low loss rates.
However, it should be noted that the amount of data sent
over the network is increased by 40.4%. Note that the 
simulation presumes that this additionally consumed bandwidth
itself does not contribute significantly to congestion. This
assumption is only valid if a small fraction of trafhc is voice
([S]). The SPB-FEC curve is convex with increasing po, as
due to the increasing loss correlation an increasing number
of consecutive packets carrying redundancy are lost leading
to unrecoverable losses. The curve for SPB-DIFFMARK is
concave, however, yielding better performance for pe & 0.22.
The inter-flow QoS ALT-MARK scheme (50% of the 
packets are marked) enhances the perceptual quality. However,
the auditory distance and the perceptual distortion of the
SPB-MARK scheme (with 40.4% of all packets marked) is
significantly lower and very close to the quality of the 
decoded signal when all packets are marked (FULL MARK).
This also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a
minor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained.
The results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that,
while the loss of some of the +l packets has some 
measurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be
considered to be very low.
