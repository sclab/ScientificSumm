In this paper we have characterized the behaviour of a 
samplebased codec (PCM) and a frame-based codec (G.729) in the
presence of packet loss. We have then developed intraflow
loss recovery and control mechanisms to increase the 
perceptual quality. While we have tested other codecs only 
informally, we think that our results reflect the fundamental 
difference between codecs which either encode the speech

form directly or which are based on linear prediction. For
PCM without loss concealment we have found that it 
neither exhibits significant temporal sensitivity nor sensitivity
to payload heterogeneity. With loss concealment, however,
the speech quality is increased but the amount of increase
exhibits strong temporal sensitivity. Frame-based codecs
amplify on one hand the impact of loss by error 
propagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to
perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.
Contrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the
concealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break
at transitions within the speech signal however, thus 
showing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.
We have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm
which is able to control loss patterns without changing the
amount of loss and characterized its performance for the
loss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity. Then
we developed a new packet marking scheme called Speech
Property-Based Selective Differential Packet Marking for
an efficient protection of frame-based codecs. The 
SPBDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority 
packets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on
the decoder"s concealment for other frames. We have also
evaluated the mapping of an end-to-end algorithm to 
interflow protection. We have found that the selective marking
scheme performs almost as good as the protection of the 
entire flow at a significantly lower number of necessary 
highpriority packets.
Thus, combined intra-flow end-to-end / hopby-hop schemes
seem to be well-suited for heavily-loaded networks with a 
relatively large fraction of voice traffic. This is the case because
they neither need the addition of redundancy nor feedback
(which would incur additional data and delay overhead) and
thus yield stable voice quality also for higher loss rates due
to absence of FEC and feedback loss. Such schemes can 
better accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are
difficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity
of both the codec and the redundancy generator. Also, it
is useful for adaptive codecs running at the lowest possible
bitrate. Avoiding redundancy and feedback is also 
interesting in multicast conferencing scenarios where the end-to-end
loss characteristics of the different paths leading to members
of the session are largely different. Our work has clearly
focused on linking simple end-to-end models which can be
easily parametrized with the known characteristic of 
hopby-hop loss control to user-level metrics. An analysis of a
large scale deployment of non-adaptive or adaptive FEC as
compared to a deployment of our combined scheme requires
clearly further study.
