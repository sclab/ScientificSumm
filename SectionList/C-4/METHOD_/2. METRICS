2.1 Packet-level metrics
A general Markov model ([19, S]) which describes the loss
process is defined as follows:
Let P( Z(s) ] Z(s - m),... ,Z(s - 2),Z(s - 1) ) be the state
transition probability of a general Markov model of order m,
where Z(s) is the loss indicator function for the packet with
the sequence number s. All combinations for the values (0
and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in
the state space. As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 
2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the
current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also
been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost. The number
of states of the model is 2. Two state transitions can
take place from any of the states. Thus, the number of
parameters which have to be computed is 2m+1. Even for
relatively small m this amount of parameters is difficult to
be evaluated and compared. Table 1 shows some values for
the state and transition probabilities for a general Markov
model of third order measured end-to-end in the Internet by
Yajnik et. al. ([19]). It is interesting to note that for all
states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet
not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in
bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition
probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.
That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss
process as much as past loss events. Intuitively this seems
to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can
be seen as a indicator for congestion relief. Andren et. al.
([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by
measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and 
no-loss-runlengths. They came to the result that such correlation is
very weak. This implies that patterns of short loss bursts
interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals
occur rarely (note in this context that in ‘&able 1 the pattern
101 has by far the lowest state probability).
Thus, in the following we employ a model ([12]) which only
considers the past loss events for the state transition 
probability. The number of states of the model can be reduced
from 2m to m + 1. This means that we only consider the
state transition probability P( Z(s) ] Z(s - k), . . . ,Z(s - 1) )
with Z(s - Ic + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, where Ic (0 < k 5 m)
is a variable parameter. We define a loss run length lc
for a sequence of Ic consecutively lost packets detected at
sj (sj > Ic > 0) with Z(sj - k - 1) = O,Z(sj) = 0 and
Z(sj - k + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, j being the j-th ‘<burst
loss event. Note that the parameters of the model become
independent of the sequence number s and can now rather
be described by the occurence ok of a loss run length k.
We define the random variable X as follows: X = 0: no
packet lost, X = k (0 < lc < m): ezactly lc consecutive
packets lost, and X 2 k (0 < k < m): at least k 
consecutive packets lost. With this definition, we establish a
loss run-length model with a finite number of states (m + 1)
which gives loss probabilities dependent on the burst length.
In the model, for every additional lost packet which adds to
the length of a loss burst a state transition takes place. If a
packet is successfully received, the state returns to X = 0.
Thus, the state probability of the system for 0 < Ic < m is
P(X 2 Zc). Due to the limited memory of the system, the
last state X = m is just defined as crm consecutive packets
lost, with P(X = m) being the state probability. Given
the case of a finite number of packets a for a flow, which
experiences d = cpC1 ]cok packet drops, we have the 
relative frequency pL,k = 2 (P(X = k) for a + 00) for the
occurence of a loss burst of length lc. An approximation for
the expectation of the random variable X can be computed
as pi = cr==, #+L,k and identified with the mean loss
rate. We can also approximate the state probabilities of the
model by the cumulative loss rate p~,~,,~(k) = CrSkp~,,,
(0 < k < m) and p~,~ = Cr.p=, (n--mzl)ot (k = m). The
transition probabilities for 1 < lc < m can be computed
easily as:
p(k--l)(k) = P(X>klX>k-l)=
P(X>knX>k-1)
P(X>k-1)
ZZ
P ( X > k )
P(X>k-1)
These conditional loss probabilities again can be

Additionally, we also define a random variable Y which de
scribes the distribution of burst loss lengths with respect
to the bunt loss events j (and not to packet events like in
the definition of X). We have the burst loss length rate
ga = * as an estimate for P(Y = k). Thus, the mean
burst loss length is g = h = e = CT==, kgb
corresponding to E[Y] (average loss gap, [5]).
The run-length model implies a geometric distribution for
residing in state X = m. For the probability of a burst loss
length of k packets we thus can compute estimates for 
performance parameters in a higher order model representation
(note that here Y represent the random variable used in the
higher-order models). For a three state model we have e.g.
for P(Y = k):
P(Y = k) =
P(Y=k)=l-pm: k=l
pn p;;" (1 -pm): k 2 2 c-4
For the special case of a system with a memory of only the
previous packet (m = l), we can use the runlength 
distribution for a simple computation of the parameters of the
commonly-used Gilbert model (Fig. 3) to characterize the
loss process (X being the associated random variable with
X = 0: no packet lost, X = 1 a packet lost). Then the
probability of being in state m can be seen BS the uncow
ditional loss probability ulp and approximated by the mean
loss (pr. = pi,,,,). Only one conditional loss probability clp
for the transition 1 --t 1 exists:
p~,E-d = CFL(~ - 
lbd (3)
If losses of one flow are correlated (i.e., the loss 
probability of an arriving packet is itiuenced by the contribution
to the state of the queue by a previous packet of the same
flow and/or both the previous and the current packet see
busty arrivals of other traffic, [15]) we have pal < clp and
thus ulp 5 clp. For pal = elp the Gilbert model is 
equivalent to a l-state (Bernotilli) model with zllp = elp (no loss
correlation).
As in equation 2 we can compute an estimate for the 
probability of a burst loss length of k packets for a higher order
model representation:
B(Y = k) = clpk-‘(1 - clp) (4)

2.2 Objective Speech Quality Metrics
Unlike the conventional methods like the Signal-t-Noise 
Ratio (SNR), novel objective quality measures attempt to 
estimate the subjective quality as closely as possible by 
modeling the human auditory system. In our evaluation we
use two objective quality measures: the Enhanced Mod&d
Bark Spectral Distortion (EMBSD, [21]) and the Measw
ing Normalizing Blocks (MNB) described in the Appendix
II of the ITU-T Recommendation P.861 ([18]). These two
objective quality measure.~ are reported to have a very high
correlation with subjective tests, their relation to the range
of subjective test result values (MOS) is close to being linear
and they are recommended as being suitable for the 
evaluation of speech degraded by transmission errors in real 
network environments such as bit errors and frame erasures
([18, 211). Both metrics are distance measures, i.e., a IB
suit value of 0 implies perfect quality, the larger the value,
the worse the speech quality is (in Fig. 5 we show an axis
with approximate corresponding MOS values). For all 
simulations in this paper we employed both schemes. As they
yielded very similar results (though MNB results generally
exhibited less variability) we only present EMBSD results.
