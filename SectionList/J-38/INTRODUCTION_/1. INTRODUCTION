When agents interact with one another, the value of their
contribution is determined by what they can do with their
skills and resources, rather than simply their identities. 
Consider the problem of forming a soccer team. For a team to
be successful, a team needs some forwards, midfielders, 
defenders, and a goalkeeper. The relevant attributes of the
players are their skills at playing each of the four positions.
The value of a team depends on how well its players can play
these positions. At a finer level, we can extend the model
to consider a wider range of skills, such as passing, 
shooting, and tackling, but the value of a team remains solely a
function of the attributes of its players.
Consider an example from the business world. 
Companies in the metals industry are usually vertically-integrated
and diversified. They have mines for various types of ores,
and also mills capable of processing and producing 
different kinds of metal. They optimize their production profile
according to the market prices for their products. For 
example, when the price of aluminum goes up, they will 
allocate more resources to producing aluminum. However, each
company is limited by the amount of ores it has, and its
capacities in processing given kinds of ores. Two or more
companies may benefit from trading ores and processing 
capacities with one another. To model the metal industry, the
relevant attributes are the amount of ores and the 
processing capacities of the companies. Given the exogenous input
of market prices, the value of a group of companies will be
determined by these attributes.
Many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by
picking the right attributes. As attributes apply to both
individual agents and groups of agents, we propose the use
of coalitional game theory to understand what groups may
form and what payoffs the agents may expect in such models.
Coalitional game theory focuses on what groups of agents
can achieve, and thus connects strongly with e-commerce,
as the Internet economies have significantly enhanced the
abilities of business to identify and capitalize on profitable
opportunities of cooperation. Our goal is to understand
the computational aspects of computing the solution 
concepts (stable and/or fair distribution of payoffs, formally
defined in Section 3) for coalitional games described using
attributes. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We define a formal representation for coalitional games
based on attributes, and relate this representation to
others proposed in the literature. We show that when
compared to other representations, there exists games
for which a multi-attribute description can be 
exponentially more succinct, and for no game it is worse.
• Given the generality of the model, positive results carry
over to other representations. We discuss two positive
results in the paper, one for the Shapley value and one
for the core, and show how these imply related results
in the literature.

• We study an approximation heuristic for the Shapley
value when its exact values cannot be found efficiently.
We provide an explicit bound on the maximum error
of the estimate, and show that the bound is 
asymptotically tight. We also carry out experiments to evaluate
how the heuristic performs on random instances.1
