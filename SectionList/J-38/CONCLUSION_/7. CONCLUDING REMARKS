Multi-attribute coalitional games constitute a very 
natural way of modeling problems of interest. Its space 
requirement compares favorably with other representations
discussed in the literature, and hence it serves well as a
prototype to study computational complexity of coalitional
game theory for a variety of problems. Positive results 
obtained under this representation can easily be translated to
results about other representations. Some of these corollary
results have been discussed in Sections 5 and 6.
An important direction to explore in the future is the
question of efficiency in updating a game, and how to 
evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch. As
pointed out at the end of Section 4.3, MACG is very 
naturally suited for updates. Representation results regarding
efficiency of updates, and algorithmic results regarding how
to compute the different solution concepts from updates, will
both be very interesting.
Our work on approximating the Shapley value when the
aggregate value function is a non-linear function of the 
attributes suggests more work to be done there as well. Given
the natural probabilistic interpretation of the Shapley value,
we believe that a random sampling approach may have 
significantly better theoretical guarantees.
