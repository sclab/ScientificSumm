In this section, we will review the relevant concepts of
coalitional game theory and its two most important solution
concepts - the Shapley value and the core. We will then
define the computational questions that will be studied in
the second half of the paper.
3.1 Coalitional Games
Throughout this paper, we assume that payoffs to groups
of agents can be freely distributed among its members. This
transferable utility assumption is commonly made in 
coalitional game theory. The canonical representation of a 
coalitional game with transferable utility is its characteristic form.
Definition 1. A coalition game with transferable utility in
characteristic form is denoted by the pair N, v , where
• N is the set of agents; and
• v : 2N
→ R is a function that maps each group of
agents S ⊆ N to a real-valued payoff.
A group of agents in a game is known as a coalition, and the
entire set of agents is known as the grand coalition.
An important class of coalitional games is the class of
monotonic games.
Definition 2. A coalitional game is monotonic if for all
S ⊂ T ⊆ N, v(S) ≤ v(T).
Another important class of coalitional games is the class
of simple games. In a simple game, a coalition either wins,
in which case it has a value of 1, or loses, in which case it
has a value of 0. It is often used to model voting situations.
Simple games are often assumed to be monotonic, i.e., if S
wins, then for all T ⊇ S, T also wins. This coincides with
the notion of using simple games as a model for voting. If a
simple game is monotonic, then it is fully described by the
set of minimal winning coalitions, i.e., coalitions S for which
v(S) = 1 but for all coalitions T ⊂ S, v(T) = 0.
An outcome in a coalitional game specifies the utilities
the agents receive. A solution concept assigns to each 
coalitional game a set of reasonable outcomes. Different 
solution concepts attempt to capture in some way outcomes
that are stable and/or fair. Two of the best known solution
concepts are the Shapley value and the core.
The Shapley value is a normative solution concept that
prescribes a fair way to divide the gains from cooperation
when the grand coalition is formed. The division of payoff
to agent i is the average marginal contribution of agent i
over all possible permutations of the agents. Formally,
Definition 3. The Shapley value of agent i, φi(v), in game
N, v is given by the following formula
φi(v) =
S⊆N\{i}
|S|!(|N| − |S| − 1)!
|N|!
(v(S ∪ {i}) − v(S))
171
The core is a descriptive solution concept that focuses on
outcomes that are stable. Stability under core means that
no set of players can jointly deviate to improve their payoffs.
Definition 4. An outcome x ∈ R|N|
is in the core of the
game N, v if for all S ⊆ N,
i∈S
xi ≥ v(S)
Note that the core of a game may be empty, i.e., there may
not exist any payoff vector that satisfies the stability 
requirement for the given game.
3.2 Computational Problems
We will study the following three problems related to 
solution concepts in coalitional games.
Problem 1. (Shapley Value) Given a description of the
coalitional game and an agent i, compute the Shapley value
of agent i.
Problem 2. (Core Membership) Given a description of
the coalitional game and a payoff vector x such that
È
i∈N xi =
v(N), determine if
È
i∈S xi ≥ v(S) for all S ⊆ N.
Problem 3. (Core Non-emptiness) Given a description
of the coalitional game, determine if there exists any payoff
vector x such that
È
i∈S xi ≥ V (S) for all S ⊆ N, andÈ
i∈N xi = v(N).
Note that the complexity of the above problems depends
on the how the game is described. All these problems will
be easy if the game is described by its characteristic form,
but only so because the description takes space 
exponential in the number of agents, and hence simple brute-force
approach takes time polynomial to the input description.
To properly understand the computational complexity 
questions, we have to look at compact representation.
