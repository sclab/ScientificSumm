In this section, we look at the complexity of the two
computational problems related to the core: Core 
Nonemptiness and Core Membership. We show that the 
nonemptiness of core of the game among attributes and the
cores of the aggregators imply non-emptiness of the core of
the game induced by the MACG. We also show that there
appears to be no such general relationship that relates the
core memberships of the game among attributes, games of
attributes, and game induced by MACG.
6.1 Problem Setup
There are many problems in the literature for which the
questions of Core Non-emptiness and Core 
Membership are known to be hard [1]. For example, for the 
edgespanning game that Deng and Papadimitriou studied [5],
both of these questions are coNP-complete. As MACG can
model the edge-spanning game in the same amount of space,
these hardness results hold for MACG as well.
As in the case for computing Shapley value, we attempt
to find a way around the hardness barrier by assuming the
existence of oracles, and try to build algorithms with these
oracles. First, we consider the aggregate value function.
Assumption 2. For a MACG N, M, A, a, w , we assume
there are oracles that answers the questions of Core 
Nonemptiness, and Core Membership for the aggregate value
function w.
When the aggregate value function is a non-negative linear
function of its attributes, the core is always non-empty, and
core membership can be determined efficiently.
The concept of core for the game among attributes makes
the most sense when the aggregators are simple games. We
will further assume that these simple games are monotonic.
Assumption 3. For a MACG N, M, A, a, w , we assume
all aggregators are monotonic and simple. We also assume
there are oracles that answers the questions of Core 
Nonemptiness, and Core Membership for the aggregators.
We consider this a mild assumption. Recall that monotonic
simple games are fully described by their set of minimal 
winning coalitions (cf Section 3). If the aggregators are 
represented as such, Core Non-emptiness and Core 
Membership can be checked in polynomial time. This is due to the
following well-known result regarding simple games:
Lemma 1. A simple game N, v has a non-empty core
if and only if it has a set of veto players, say V , such that
v(S) = 0 for all S ⊇ V . Further, A payoff vector x is in the
core if and only if xi = 0 for all i /∈ V .
6.2 Core Non-emptiness
There is a strong connection between the non-emptiness
of the cores of the games among attributes, games of the
attributes, and the game induced by a MACG.
Theorem 4. Given a game N, v represented as a MACG
N, M, A, a, w , if the core of the game among attributes,
176
M, w , is non-empty, and the cores of the games of 
attributes are non-empty, then the core of N, v is non-empty.
Proof. Let u be an arbitrary payoff vector in the core of
the game among attributes, M, w . For each attribute j,
let θj
be an arbitrary payoff vector in the core of the game
of attribute j. By Lemma 1, each attribute j must have a
set of veto players; let this set be denoted by Pj
. For each
agent i ∈ N, let yi =
È
j ujθj
i . We claim that this vector y
is in the core of N, v . Consider any coalition S ⊆ N,
v(S) = w(a(A, S)) ≤
j:S⊇P j
uj (4)
This is true because an aggregator cannot evaluate to 1 
without all members of the veto set. For any attribute j, by
Lemma 1,
È
i∈P j θj
i = 1. Therefore,
j:S⊇P j
uj =
j:S⊇P j
uj
i∈P j
θj
i
=
i∈S j:S⊇P j
ujθj
i
≤
i∈S
yi
Note that the proof is constructive, and hence if we are
given an element in the core of the game among attributes,
we can construct an element of the core of the coalitional
game. From Theorem 4, we can obtain the following 
corollaries that have been previously shown in the literature.
Corollary 3. The core of the edge-spanning game of [5]
is non-empty when the edge weights are non-negative.
Proof. Let the players be the vertices, and their 
attributes the edges incident on them. For each attribute,
there is a veto set - namely, both endpoints of the edges.
As previously observed, an aggregate value function that is a
non-negative linear function of its aggregates has non-empty
core. Therefore, the precondition of Theorem 4 is satisfied,
and the edge-spanning game with non-negative edge weights
has a non-empty core.
Corollary 4 (Theorem 1 of [4]). The core of a flow
game with committee control, where each edge is controlled
by a simple game with a veto set of players, is non-empty.
Proof. We treat each edge of the flow game as an 
attribute, and so each attribute has a veto set of players. The
core of a flow game (without committee) has been shown
to be non-empty in [8]. We can again invoke Theorem 4 to
show the non-emptiness of core for flow games with 
committee control.
However, the core of the game induced by a MACG may
be non-empty even when the core of the game among 
attributes is empty, as illustrated by the following example.
Example 3. Suppose the minimal winning coalition of all
aggregators in a MACG N, M, A, a, w is N, then v(S) = 0
for all coalitions S ⊂ N. As long as v(N) ≥ 0, any 
nonnegative vector x that satisfies
È
i∈N xi = v(N) is in the
core of N, v .
Complementary to the example above, when all the 
aggregators have empty cores, the core of N, v is also empty.
Theorem 5. Given a game N, v represented as a MACG
N, M, A, a, w , if the cores of all aggregators are empty,
v(N) > 0, and for each i ∈ N, v({i}) ≥ 0, then the core of
N, v is empty.
Proof. Suppose the core of N, v is non-empty. Let x
be a member of the core, and pick an agent i such that xi >
0. However, for each attribute, since the core is empty, by
Lemma 1, there are at least two disjoint winning coalitions.
Pick the winning coalition Sj
that does not include i for
each attribute j. Let S∗
=
Ë
j Sj
. Because S∗
is winning
for all coalitions, v(S∗
) = v(N). However,
v(N) =
j∈N
xj = xi +
j /∈N
xj ≥ xi +
j∈S∗
xj >
j∈S∗
xj
Therefore, v(S∗
) >
È
j∈S∗ xj, contradicting the fact that x
is in the core of N, v .
We do not have general results regarding the problem of
Core Non-emptiness when some of the aggregators have
non-empty cores while others have empty cores. We suspect
knowledge about the status of the cores of the aggregators
alone is insufficient to decide this problem.
6.3 Core Membership
Since it is possible for the game induced by the MACG
to have a non-empty core when the core of the aggregate
value function is empty (Example 3), we try to explore the
problem of Core Membership assuming that the core of
both the game among attributes, M, w , and the underlying
game, N, v , is known to be non-empty, and see if there
is any relationship between their members. One reasonable
requirement is whether a payoff vector x in the core of N, v
can be decomposed and re-aggregated to a payoff vector y
in the core of M, w . Formally,
Definition 11. We say that a vector x ∈ Rn
≥0 can be 
decomposed and re-aggregated into a vector y ∈ Rm
≥0 if there
exists Z ∈ Rm×n
≥0 , such that
yi =
n
j=1
Zij for all i
xj =
m
i=1
Zij for all j
We may refer Z as shares.
When there is no restriction on the entries of Z, it is 
always possible to decompose a payoff vector x in the core of
N, v to a payoff vector y in the core of M, w . However, it
seems reasonable to restrict that if an agent j is irrelevant to
the aggregator i, i.e., i never changes the outcome of 
aggregator j, then Zij should be restricted to be 0. Unfortunately,
this restriction is already too strong.
Example 4. Consider a MACG N, M, A, a, w with two
players and three attributes. Suppose agent 1 is irrelevant
to attribute 1, and agent 2 is irrelevant to attributes 2 and
3. For any set of attributes T ⊆ M, let w be defined as
w(T) =
0 if |T| = 0 or 1
6 if |T| = 2
10 if |T| = 3
177
Since the core of a game with a finite number of players forms
a polytope, we can verify that the set of vectors (4, 4, 2),
(4, 2, 4), and (2, 4, 4), fully characterize the core C of M, w .
On the other hand, the vector (10, 0) is in the core of N, v .
This vector cannot be decomposed and re-aggregated to a
vector in C under the stated restriction.
Because of the apparent lack of relationship among 
members of the core of N, v and that of M, w , we believe an
algorithm for testing Core Membership will require more
input than just the veto sets of the aggregators and the 
oracle of Core Membership for the aggregate value function.
