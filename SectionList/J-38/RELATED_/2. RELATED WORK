Coalitional game theory has been well studied in 
economics [9, 10, 14]. A vast amount of literature have focused
on defining and comparing solution concepts, and 
determining their existence and properties. The first algorithmic
study of coalitional games, as far as we know, is performed
by Deng and Papadimitriou in [5]. They consider coalitional
games defined on graphs, where the players are the vertices
and the value of coalition is determined by the sum of the
weights of the edges spanned by these players. This can be
efficiently modeled and generalized using attributes.
As a formal representation, multi-attribute coalitional games
is closely related to the multi-issue representation of Conitzer
and Sandholm [3] and our work on marginal contribution
networks [7]. Both of these representations are based on
dividing a coalitional game into subgames (termed issues
in [3] and rules in [7]), and aggregating the subgames via
linear combination. The key difference in our work is the
unrestricted aggregation of subgames: the aggregation could
be via a polynomial function of the attributes, or even by
treating the subgames as input to another computational
problem such as a min-cost flow problem. The relationship
of these models will be made clear after we define the 
multiattribute representation in Section 4.
Another representation proposed in the literature is one
specialized for superadditive games by Conitzer and 
Sandholm [2]. This representation is succinct, but to find the
values of some coalitions may require solving an NP-hard
problem. While it is possible for multi-attribute coalitional
games to efficiently represent these games, it necessarily 
requires the solution to an NP-hard problem in order to find
out the values of some coalitions. In this paper, we stay
within the boundary of games that admits efficient 
algorithm for determining the value of coalitions. We will 
therefore not make further comparisons with [2].
The model of coalitional games with attributes has been
considered in the works of Shehory and Kraus. They model
the agents as possessing capabilities that indicates their 
proficiencies in different areas, and consider how to efficiently
allocate tasks [12] and the dynamics of coalition formation
[13]. Our work differs significantly as our focus is on 
reasoning about solution concepts. Our model also covers a wider
scope as attributes generalize the notion of capabilities.
Yokoo et al. have also considered a model of coalitional
games where agents are modeled by sets of skills, and these
skills in turn determine the value of coalitions [15]. There are
two major differences between their work and ours. Firstly,
Yokoo et al. assume that each skill is fundamentally different
from another, hence no two agents may possess the same
skill. Also, they focus on developing new solution concepts
that are robust with respect to manipulation by agents. Our
focus is on reasoning about traditional solution concepts.

We acknowledge that random instances may not be typical
of what happens in practice, but given the generality of our
model, it provides the most unbiased view.
Our work is also related to the study of cooperative games
with committee control [4]. In these games, there is usually
an underlying set of resources each controlled by a 
(possibly overlapping) set of players known as the committee,
engaged in a simple game (defined in Section 3). 
multiattribute coalitional games generalize these by considering
relationship between the committee and the resources 
beyond simple games. We note that when restricted to simple
games, we derive similar results to that in [4].
