In this paper we have presented an investigation of Implicit Relevance
Feedback (IRF). We aimed to answer three research questions about
factors that may affect the provision and usefulness of IRF. These
factors were search task complexity, the subjects" search experience
and the stage in the search. Our overall conclusion was that all factors

appear to have some effect on the use and effectiveness of IRF,
although the interaction effects between factors are not statistically
significant.
Our conclusions per each research question are: (i) IRF is generally
more useful for complex search tasks, where searchers want to focus
on the search task and get new ideas for their search from the system,
(ii) IRF is preferred to ERF overall and generally preferred by
inexperienced subjects wanting to reduce the burden of providing RF,
and (iii) within a single search session IRF is affected by temporal
location in a search (i.e., it is used in the middle, not the beginning or
end) and task complexity.
Studies of this nature are important to establish the circumstances
where a promising technique such as IRF are useful and those when it
is not. It is only after such studies have been run and analysed in this
way can we develop an understanding of IRF that allow it to be
successfully implemented in operational IR systems.
