Information Retrieval (IR) systems are designed to help searchers
solve problems. In the traditional interaction metaphor employed by
Web search systems such as Yahoo! and MSN Search, the system
generally only supports the retrieval of potentially relevant documents
from the collection. However, it is also possible to offer support to
searchers for different search activities, such as selecting the terms to
present to the system or choosing which search strategy to adopt [3,
8]; both of which can be problematic for searchers.
As the quality of the query submitted to the system directly affects the
quality of search results, the issue of how to improve search queries
has been studied extensively in IR research [6]. Techniques such as
Relevance Feedback (RF) [11] have been proposed as a way in which
the IR system can support the iterative development of a search query
by suggesting alternative terms for query modification. However, in
practice RF techniques have been underutilised as they place an
increased cognitive burden on searchers to directly indicate relevant
results [10].
Implicit Relevance Feedback (IRF) [7] has been proposed as a way in
which search queries can be improved by passively observing
searchers as they interact. IRF has been implemented either through
the use of surrogate measures based on interaction with documents
(such as reading time, scrolling or document retention) [7] or using
interaction with browse-based result interfaces [5]. IRF has been
shown to display mixed effectiveness because the factors that are good
indicators of user interest are often erratic and the inferences drawn
from user interaction are not always valid [7].
In this paper we present a study into the use and effectiveness of IRF
in an online search environment. The study aims to investigate the
factors that affect IRF, in particular three research questions: (i) is the
use of and perceived quality of terms generated by IRF affected by the
search task? (ii) is the use of and perceived quality of terms generated
by IRF affected by the level of search experience of system users? (iii)
is IRF equally used and does it generate terms that are equally useful
at all search stages? This study aims to establish when, and under what
circumstances, IRF performs well in terms of its use and the query
modification terms selected as a result of its use.
The main experiment from which the data are taken was designed to
test techniques for selecting query modification terms and techniques
for displaying retrieval results [13]. In this paper we use data derived
from that experiment to study factors affecting the utility of IRF.
