In this section we discuss the implications of the findings presented in
the previous section for each research question.
4.1 Search Task
The results of our study showed that ERF was preferred for less
complex tasks and IRF for more complex tasks. From observations
and subject comments we perceived that when using ERF systems
subjects generally forgot to provide the feedback but also employed
different criteria during the ERF process (i.e., they were assessing
relevance rather than expressing an interest). When the search was
more complex subjects rarely found results they regarded as
completely relevant. Therefore they struggled to find relevant

information and were unable to communicate RF to the search system.
In these situations subjects appeared to prefer IRF as they do not need
to make a relevance decision to obtain the benefits of RF, i.e., term
suggestions, whereas in ERF they do.
The association between RF method and task complexity has
implications for the design of user studies of RF systems and the RF
systems themselves. It implies that in the design of user studies
involving ERF or IRF systems care should be taken to include tasks of
varying complexities, to avoid task bias. Also, in the design of search
systems it implies that since different types of RF may be appropriate
for different task complexities then a system that could automatically
detect complexity could use both ERF and IRF simultaneously to
benefit the searcher. For example, on the IRF system we noticed that
as task complexity falls search behaviour shifts from results interface
to retrieved documents. Monitoring such interaction across a number
of studies may lead to a set of criteria that could help IR systems
automatically detect task complexity and tailor support to suit.
4.2 Search Experience
We analysed the affect of search experience on the utility of IRF. Our
analysis revealed a general preference across all subjects for IRF over
ERF. That is, the average ratings assigned to IRF were generally more
positive than those assigned to ERF. However, IRF was generally
liked by both subject groups (perhaps because it removed the burden
of providing relevance information) and ERF was generally preferred
by experienced subjects more than inexperienced subjects (perhaps
because it allowed them to specify which results were used by the
system when generating term recommendations).
All subjects felt more in control with ERF than IRF, but for
inexperienced subjects this did not appear to affect their overall
preferences29
. These subjects may understand the RF process less, but
may be more willing to sacrifice control over feedback in favour of
IRF, a process that they perceive more positively.
4.3 Search Stage
We also analysed the effects of search stage on the use and usefulness
of IRF. Through analysis of this nature we can build a more complete
picture of how searchers used RF and how this varies based on the RF
method. The results suggest that IRF is used more in the middle of
the search than at the beginning or end, whereas ERF is used more
towards the end. The results also show the effects of task complexity
on the IRF process and how rapidly subjects reach their most
interactive point. Without an analysis of this type it would not have
been possible to establish the existence of such patterns of behaviour.
The findings suggest that searchers interact differently for IRF and
ERF. Since ERF is not traditionally used until toward the end of the
search it may be possible to incorporate both IRF and ERF into the
same IR system, with IRF being used to gather evidence until subjects
decide to use ERF. The development of such a system represents part
of our ongoing work in this area.
