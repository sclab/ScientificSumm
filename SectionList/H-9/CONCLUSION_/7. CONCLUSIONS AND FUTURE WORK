In this paper, we studied the problem of organizing search
results in a user-oriented manner. To attain this goal, we
rely on search engine logs to learn interesting aspects from
users" perspective. Given a query, we retrieve its related
queries from past query history, learn the aspects by 
clustering the past queries and the associated clickthrough 
information, and categorize the search results into the aspects
learned. We compared our log-based method with the 
traditional cluster-based method and the baseline of search 
engine ranking. The experiments show that our log-based
method can consistently outperform cluster-based method
and improve over the ranking baseline, especially when the
queries are difficult or the search results are diverse. 
Furthermore, our log-based method can generate more 
meaningful aspect labels than the cluster labels generated based
on search results when we cluster search results.
There are several interesting directions for further 
extending our work: First, although our experiment results have
clearly shown promise of the idea of learning from search
logs to organize search results, the methods we have 
experimented with are relatively simple. It would be interesting
to explore other potentially more effective methods. In 
particular, we hope to develop probabilistic models for learning
aspects and organizing results simultaneously. Second, with
the proposed way of organizing search results, we can 
expect to obtain informative feedback information from a user
(e.g., the aspect chosen by a user to view). It would thus
be interesting to study how to further improve the 
organization of the results based on such feedback information.
Finally, we can combine a general search log with any 
personal search log to customize and optimize the organization
of search results for each individual user.
