The utility of a search engine is affected by multiple 
factors. While the primary factor is the soundness of the 
underlying retrieval model and ranking function, how to organize
and present search results is also a very important factor
that can affect the utility of a search engine significantly.
Compared with the vast amount of literature on retrieval
models, however, there is relatively little research on how to
improve the effectiveness of search result organization.
The most common strategy of presenting search results is
a simple ranked list. Intuitively, such a presentation 
strategy is reasonable for non-ambiguous, homogeneous search
results; in general, it would work well when the search 
results are good and a user can easily find many relevant 
documents in the top ranked results.
However, when the search results are diverse (e.g., due
to ambiguity or multiple aspects of a topic) as is often the
case in Web search, the ranked list presentation would not
be effective; in such a case, it would be better to group the
search results into clusters so that a user can easily navigate
into a particular interesting group. For example, the results
in the first page returned from Google for the ambiguous
query jaguar (as of Dec. 2nd, 2006) contain at least four
different senses of jaguar (i.e., car, animal, software, and a
sports team); even for a more refined query such as jaguar
team picture, the results are still quite ambiguous, 
including at least four different jaguar teams - a wrestling team, a
jaguar car team, Southwestern College Jaguar softball team,
and Jacksonville Jaguar football team. Moreover, if a user
wants to find a place to download a jaguar software, a query
such as download jaguar is also not very effective as the
dominating results are about downloading jaguar brochure,
jaguar wallpaper, and jaguar DVD. In these examples, a
clustering view of the search results would be much more
useful to a user than a simple ranked list. Clustering is also
useful when the search results are poor, in which case, a user
would otherwise have to go through a long list sequentially
to reach the very first relevant document.
As a primary alternative strategy for presenting search
results, clustering search results has been studied relatively
extensively [9, 15, 26, 27, 28]. The general idea in virtually
all the existing work is to perform clustering on a set of 
topranked search results to partition the results into natural
clusters, which often correspond to different subtopics of the
general query topic. A label will be generated to indicate
what each cluster is about. A user can then view the labels
to decide which cluster to look into. Such a strategy has
been shown to be more useful than the simple ranked list
presentation in several studies [8, 9, 26].
However, this clustering strategy has two deficiencies which
make it not always work well:
First, the clusters discovered in this way do not necessarily
correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the
user"s perspective. For example, users are often interested
in finding either phone codes or zip codes when entering
the query area codes. But the clusters discovered by the
current methods may partition the results into local codes
and international codes. Such clusters would not be very
useful for users; even the best cluster would still have a low
precision.
Second, the cluster labels generated are not informative
enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster. There
are two reasons for this problem: (1) The clusters are not
corresponding to a user"s interests, so their labels would not
be very meaningful or useful. (2) Even if a cluster really
corresponds to an interesting aspect of the topic, the label
may not be informative because it is usually generated based
on the contents in a cluster, and it is possible that the user is
not very familiar with some of the terms. For example, the
ambiguous query jaguar may mean an animal or a car. A
cluster may be labeled as panthera onca. Although this
is an accurate label for a cluster with the animal sense of
jaguar, if a user is not familiar with the phrase, the label
would not be helpful.
In this paper, we propose a different strategy for 
partitioning search results, which addresses these two deficiencies
through imposing a user-oriented partitioning of the search
results. That is, we try to figure out what aspects of a search
topic are likely interesting to a user and organize the results
accordingly. Specifically, we propose to do the following:
First, we will learn interesting aspects of similar topics
from search logs and organize search results based on these
interesting aspects. For example, if the current query has
occurred many times in the search logs, we can look at what
kinds of pages viewed by the users in the results and what
kind of words are used together with such a query. In case
when the query is ambiguous such as jaguar we can expect
to see some clear clusters corresponding different senses of
jaguar. More importantly, even if a word is not ambiguous
(e.g., car), we may still discover interesting aspects such
as car rental and car pricing (which happened to be
the two primary aspects discovered in our search log data).
Such aspects can be very useful for organizing future search
results about car. Note that in the case of car, 
clusters generated using regular clustering may not necessarily
reflect such interesting aspects about car from a user"s
perspective, even though the generated clusters are 
coherent and meaningful in other ways.
Second, we will generate more meaningful cluster labels
using past query words entered by users. Assuming that the
past search logs can help us learn what specific aspects are
interesting to users given the current query topic, we could
also expect that those query words entered by users in the
past that are associated with the current query can provide
meaningful descriptions of the distinct aspects. Thus they
can be better labels than those extracted from the ordinary
contents of search results.
To implement the ideas presented above, we rely on search
engine logs and build a history collection containing the past
queries and the associated clickthroughs. Given a new query,
we find its related past queries from the history collection
and learn aspects through applying the star clustering 
algorithm [2] to these past queries and clickthroughs. We
can then organize the search results into these aspects using
categorization techniques and label each aspect by the most
representative past query in the query cluster.
We evaluate our method for result organization using logs
of a commercial search engine. We compare our method
with the default search engine ranking and the traditional
clustering of search results. The results show that our method
is effective for improving search utility and the labels 
generated using past query words are more readable than those
generated using traditional clustering approaches.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first
review the related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we 
describe search engine log data and our procedure of building
a history collection. In Section 4, we present our approach
in details. We describe the data set in Section 5 and the
experimental results are discussed in Section 6. Finally, we
conclude our paper and discuss future work in Section 7.
