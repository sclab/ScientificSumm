pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple
client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server
that runs on a commodity PC. The server leverages more
powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application
logic. The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and
virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to
the applications. Screen updates are then sent back from
the server to the client for display to the user.
When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is 
presented with a simple graphical interface where information
such as server address and port, user authentication 
information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first
attempts to connect to the server and perform the 
necessary handshaking. Once this process has been completed,
pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of
his session. If the session does not exist, a new session is 
created. Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without
changes in the session setting or server configuration.
Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user
with a persistent web session model in which a user can
launch a session running a web browser and associated 
applications at the server, then disconnect from that session
and reconnect to it again anytime. When a user reconnects
to the session, all of the applications continue running where
the user left off, so that the user can continue working as
though he or she never disconnected. The ability to 
disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important
benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have 
intermittent network connectivity.
pTHINC"s persistent web session model enables a user to
reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one
on which the web session was originally initiated. This 
provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.
If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to
access his web session. Furthermore, pTHINC allows users
to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well. A
user can access the same persistent web session on a 
desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web
session from any computer.
pTHINC"s persistent web session model addresses a key
problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a 
common web environment across computers. Web browsers 
often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies,
and history, which enable them to function in a much more
useful manner. The problem that occurs when a user moves
between computers is that this data, which is specific to a
web browser installation, cannot move with the user. 
Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to
process different media content, and those applications may
not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC
addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use
the exact same web browser environment and helper 
applications from any computer. As a result, pTHINC can 
provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for
mobile users across different devices without requiring them
to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing
environments across multiple machines.
To enable a user to access the same web session on 
different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to 
support different display sizes and resolutions. Toward this end,
pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to
zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web

session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being
used. For example, if the server is running a web session at
1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution
of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit
the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC
provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size
of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.
Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly
visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing 
feature to better navigate through web pages. For example,
a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page
content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region
of interest for a better view.
To enable a user to access the same web session on 
different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to
support different display orientations. In a desktop 
environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays
presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger
than its height. However, in a PDA environment, the choice
is not always obvious. Some users may prefer having the
display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device
in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in
order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary
to view a web page. To accommodate PDA user 
preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables
it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and 
portrait mode. The landscape mode is particularly useful for
pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on
both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with
the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.
Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on
PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the
screen area available to display the web session. To be able
to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user
to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical
shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the 
control functions available to the user. The buttons used by
pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they
are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application
when they are pressed. Figure 1 shows how pTHINC 
utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and
improve the overall user experience. These buttons are not
device specific, and the layout shown is common to 
widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to
support its usage model:
• Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is
used to rotate the screen between portrait and 
landscape mode each time the button is pressed.
• Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front
is used to zoom out the display of the web session
providing a bird"s eye view of the web session.
• Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom
front is used to zoom in the display of the web session
to more clearly view content of interest.
• Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom
front is used to scroll around the display using a single
control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA
users. This feature is particularly useful when the user
has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only
part of the display is visible on the screen.
• Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on
the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard
drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical
keyboard. The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA
OS mechanisms, providing portability across different
PDA environments.
• Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom
front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session.
pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard
user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface 
pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse
in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC
does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not 
provide one. Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on 
different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus. A
single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding 
single click mouse event. A double tap on the touch screen 
generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC
provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to
press down on the screen for one second to generate a right
mouse click. All of these actions are identical to the way
users already interact with PDA applications in the common
PocketPC environment. In web browsing, users can click on
hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on
the desired screen area of interest. Unlike local PDA web
browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages
more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable
users to manipulate multiple open application windows 
instead of being limited to a single application window at any
given moment. This provides increased browsing flexibility
beyond what is currently available on PDA devices. Similar
to a desktop environment, browser windows and other 
application windows can be moved around by pressing down
and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse.
