Our general framework for describing the kind of MASs
we are interested in is fairly simple. Let Ag = {1, . . . , n}
a finite set of agents, {Aci}i∈Ag a collection of action sets
(where Aci are the actions of agent i), A = ×n
i=1Aci the
joint action space, and Env a set of environment states. A
run is a sequence r = e1
a1
→ . . .
at−1
→ et where ai ∈ A (ai[j]
denotes the action of agent j in this tuple), and ei ∈ Env.
We define |r| = t, last(r) = et, r[1 : j] is short for the j-long
initial sub-sequence of r, and we write r r for any run r
iff ∃j ∈ N.r = r[1 : j].
Writing R(Env, A) for the set of all possible runs, we can
view each agent i as a function gi : R(Env, A) → Aci 
describing the agent"s action choices depending on the 
history of previous environment states and joint actions. The
set of all agent functions for i given A and Env is 
denoted by Gi(Env, A). The (finite, discrete, stationary,
fully accessible, deterministic) environment is defined by a
state transformer function f : Env × A → Env, so that
the system"s operation for an initial state e1 is defined by
ei+1 = f(ei, g(e1
a1
→ . . .
ai−1
→ ei)) for all i ≥ 1 (g is the joint
vector of functions gi). This definition implies that 
execution of actions is synchronised among agents, so that the
system evolves though an execution of rounds where all
agents perform their actions simultaneously.
We denote the set of all runs given a particular 
configuration of agent functions g by R(Env, A, g). We write
gi ∼ r where gi an agent function and r a run iff ∀1 ≤
j ≤ |r|.gi(r[1 : j]) = aj [i] (i.e. gi is compatible with r in
every time step as far as i"s actions are concerned).
We use a (standard) propositional logical language L with
entailment relation e |= ϕ for e ∈ Env and ϕ ∈ L 
deunset pending
cancelled
active
violated
fulfilled

using solid lines indicate transitions brought about
by agent communication, dashed lines indicate

fined in the usual way.1
We introduce special propositions
Done(i, a) for each action a ∈ ∪n
i=1Aci in L to denote it is
true that action a has just been performed, extending |=
to runs r in the following way:
r |= ϕ if last(r) |= ϕ
r |= Done(i, a) if r = e1
a1
→ . . .
at−1
→ et ∧ a = at−1[i]
i.e. Done(i, a) is exactly true for those actions that made up
part of the joint action vector ai−1 in the predecessor state,
and all other formulae that were entailed by the last state of
r are still valid. Our model implies that each agent executes
exactly one action in each time step.
2.1 Commitments
Our notion of commitments is based on a slight variation
of the framework proposed by Fornara and Colombetti [6]:
Commitments come into existence as unset, e.g. when a
request for achieving χ if a certain condition ϕ becomes true
is issued from i to j. The commitment becomes pending if
the debtor j is required to fulfill it, e.g. after having accepted
it. A pending commitment will become active if its 
condition ϕ becomes true, and if χ is brought about in that case
it becomes fulfilled, otherwise violated. Commitments
can become cancelled in different situations, e.g. if an 
unset commitment is rejected. Also, environmental events can
lead χ to become true in which case the commitment 
becomes fulfilled without the debtor"s contribution. Figure 1
provides a graphic representation of commitment state 
transitions in this framework.
Apart from a slightly different notation used to maintain
a more detailed history of commitments, we will extend
them to also contain a deactivation condition ψ apart from
ϕ (which we call activation condition) which causes any
commitment to be cancelled if it becomes true.
1
More precisely L contains atomic propositions P =
{p, q, . . .}, the usual connectives ∨ and ¬ (with 
abbreviations ⇒ and ∧). As for semantics, a function interpretation
function I : P ×Env → { , ⊥} assigns a truth value to each
proposition in each environmental state, and the entailment
relation e |= ϕ for e ∈ Env and ϕ ∈ L is defined inductively:
e |= ϕ if ϕ ∈ P and I(ϕ, e) = ; e |= ¬ϕ if e |= ϕ; e |= ϕ ∨ ψ
if e |= ϕ or e |= ψ.

Table 1: Environmental commitment processing rules for current run r with |r| = t
Definition 1. A commitment is a structure
ι, s : χ ⊕ ϕ ψ i→j
t
where
- ι is a unique commitment identifier,
- s denotes the commitment state (any of unset, 
pending, active, violated, fulfilled, or cancelled, 
abbreviated by the respective initial),
- i is the debtor, j is the creditor,
- χ ∈ L is the debitum (i.e. the proposition that i 
commits to making true in front of j),
- ϕ, ψ ∈ L are the activation/deactivation conditions,
- and t is the instant (in a run) at which this 
commitment entered its current state s.
As an example,
x, v : received(5, $500) ⊕ received(3, toys)
returned(3, toys) 3→5
12
denotes that agent 3 violated commitment x towards agent
5 to pay him $500 in timestep 12. He was supposed to make
the payment after receiving the toys unless he sent back the
toys. We introduce deactivation conditions so as to be able
to completely revoke existing commitments: Sending back
the money does not constitute a fulfillment of the original
contract, but instead an annulment thereof. This provides
us with the capability to define validity conditions using
ϕ and ψ, which is useful for things like deadlines for unset
commitments (if I don"t get a response within 3 time-steps
my request will expire).
For brevity, we sometimes omit indices or content 
elements when clear from the context (in particular, we often
write Γ for the content χ ⊕ ϕ ψ). We write C for the set of
all possible commitments and denote sets of commitments
(so-called commitment stores) by CS ∈ ℘fin (C).
To handle the effects of environmental events and agent
actions on a commitment store CS, table 1 introduces five
commitment transition rules which are executed in each time
step by the system or any observer who intends to clarify
the status of existing commitments in the order shown: the
deactivation rule D is the first to fire and cancels any 
unset, pending or active commitments if ψ becomes true. For
the remaining pending commitments2
, the activation rule A
describes how these become active if ϕ becomes true. Note
that when ϕ is true in subsequent states we check whether
2
To avoid problems with contradictory commitment 
specifications (e.g. when both ϕ and ψ become true), we give
deactivation strict precedence over activation.
this active commitment is contained in CS to avoid 
duplicates (this is because we keep a full record of the 
commitment history for reasons which will become clear below).3
Rule S caters for serendipity i.e. fulfillment of 
commitments not brought about by the respective agent, but 
simply by environmental changes that made the debitum true.
Finally, the fulfilment/violation rules F/V record whether
the action performed by the debtor in the previous step
(r |= Done(i, a)) has caused the debitum χ of any 
commitment which became active in the previous timestep to 
become true. We need only consider those commitments that
became active in the previous step t − 1 since we can 
verify their fulfilment status in t. This verification hinges on a
domain-dependent predicate causes(a, χ) which we have not
mentioned so far. It should be true if action a is supposed
to bring about χ, and delineates the existing social notion
of what constitutes a reasonable attempt to achieve χ in
the given context (its definition may range from requiring
that χ has actually been achieved to allowing any action a
that does not necessarily result in ¬χ).
2.2 Grounding
In Fornara and Colombetti"s and similar approaches,
the status of commitments is verifiable, but they are not
grounded in expectations about interaction. Such semantics
(similar in style to what he have just defined in terms of
CS update rules) tell us what commitments exist and which
state they are in, but not how this will affect future agent
behaviour.
To provide such grounding, we introduce notions of 
compliant and expected behaviour. An agent is behaving in 
compliance with its commitments if it always immediately 
fulfills all active commitments. More precisely, the behaviour
of agent i is said to be compliant with CS at time t iff
∀k ≤ t

ι, a : Γ i→j
k ∈ CS ⇒ ι, f : Γ i→j
k ∈ CS

Though simple, this definition of compliance is not very 
useful because it places constraints on CSs but not on actual
agent functions. To achieve this, we can instead use the
contents of the CS to restrict the range of admissible agent
functions to those that are in accordance with it using the
following definition:
Definition 2. For any run r ∈ R(Env, A), let CS(r) the
set of commitments that has resulted from execution of r
assuming that certain actions (including messages) create
commitments or change their status. The set of compliant
agent functions with respect to a commitment store CS is
3
While commitment identifiers adversely affect the 
readability of our notation, they are necessary here to uniquely 
determine which pending commitment is activated.

defined as
compliant(CS) :=
˘
gi ∈ Gi(Env, A)
˛
˛
∀r ∼ gi. ι, p : χ ⊕ ϕ ψ i→j
∈ CS(r) = CS.
∀r r. ι, a : χ ⊕ ϕ ψ i→j
|r | ∈ CS(r ) ⇒
`
∃a ∈ Aci.causes(a, χ) ∧ gi(r ) = a
´ ¯
What this definition captures is the following 
characterisation of a compliant agent function gi: for all runs r that the
agent function gi contributes to: if r has created a pending
commitment regarding χ, then if this commitment becomes
active at the end of some extension r of r in the future, gi
will cause the agent to perform an action a that causes χ.4
Next, to cater for the anticipation of non-compliant 
behaviour we need to introduce a notion of expected 
behaviour that overrides compliant behaviour. For this, we
introduce a second type of commitments which we will call
expectations to avoid confusion and distinguish from 
ordinary (now called normative) commitments by using round
brackets (ι, s : Γ)i→j
t . They are treated exactly like other
commitments in terms of the rules introduced above but 
express what the agent is expected to do (in the non-normative
sense of an objective prediction of behaviour) rather than
what it is supposed to do in a normative sense.
To define the notions we need below, we introduce the
following constructs:
CS := { ι, s : Γ ∈ CS|s ∈ {u, p, a, f, v}}
CS := {(ι, s : Γ) ∈ CS|(ι, s : Γ) ∈ CS,
ι, s : Γ ∈ CS, s, s ∈ {u, p, a, f, v}}
CS simply restricts the commitment store to all 
normative commitments. Hence, compliant( CS ) specifies what
agents are supposed to do. CS , on the other hand, 
overrides all normative commitment elements in CS for which
an expectation also exists, i.e. expectations are given 
precedence over the normative commitments. With this, we can
define expected behaviour as
expected(CS) := compliant( CS )
i.e. behaviour that adheres to expectations where such
expectations exist and is compliant otherwise. The
separate, parallel, treatment of compliant and expected
behaviour has two advantages: Firstly, we can respond to
unexpected compliant behaviour, i.e. when we expect
that someone will not obey their commitments we can still
respond to it if they do (and, for example, regain trust
in them). Secondly, we can cater for a variety of rules
for translating commitment stores to actual future events
which a reasoning agent can use in its planning process.
For the purposes of this paper, we will assume that agents
base their predictions about others on expected behaviour
if it is different from compliant behaviour, and that they
predict compliant behaviour, else.
4
Note the quantification in this definition: the property has
to hold for every run that gave rise to ι and is compatible
with gi. In particular, this must be independent of any
part of the history (e.g. other agents" actions and previous
environment states) given CS(r). We also quantify over all
extensions r of r, i.e. fulfillment of the commitment has to
happen if the appropriate conditions arise regardless of other
factors.
2.3 Static ACL Semantics
Table 2 shows an example for a small fragment of an ACL
semantics defined using our framework, with two alternative
definitions (AC and AC2) for the semantics of the accept
message type. Each of the so-called dialogue operators 
(similar to AI planning action schemata) is defined using the
graphical notation
p
a
q
where p, a, and q are schemata for preconditions, messages
(of a certain type), and post-conditions, respectively. 
Preconditions determine whether an action schema is 
applicable in a certain situation or not and contain formulae from
L and/or constraints on the current contents of CS. 
PostConditions contain changes to the knowledge base and 
modifications to CS, i.e. they are interpreted like 
add/deletelists in traditional AI planning. For any such operator
o = p, a, q we define pre(o) = p, action(o) = a and
post(o) = q. All elements of a dialogue operator can 
contain logical variables in their pre- and post-conditions and
sender/receiver/content variables in the action slot.
In our example fragment, the operator RQ for requests
creates an unset commitment with a fresh identifier ι and
current timestamp (we assume that r |= time(t) ⇔ |r| = t,
and there is a global system time that can be inspected by all
agents), and AC/RJ add a pending/cancelled equivalent of
ι to CS. A fragment consisting of {RQ, RJ, AC} is 
equivalent to the standard semantics of the respective performative
types defined in [6].5
Note that our operators only contain
objectively verifiable pre- and post-conditions, and if agents
want to conform to it they need to comply with these 
operators. In the following, we will assume that agents always
adhere to the ACL specification syntactically6
.
Using AC2 instead of AC enables us to exploit the
power of our distinction between compliant and expected
behaviour, expressing that we don"t trust i to adhere to the
normal semantics of accept: its postcondition specifies
that expected(CS) is not restricted to behaviours that will
fulfill the commitment but suggest that it has actually been
cancelled. At the same time, we maintain the normative
commitment that ι is pending so that i"s behaviour would
be seen to lie within compliant(CS) if i deviates from our
(pessimistic) expectation and does the right thing instead.
2.4 Dynamic Semantics
2.4.1 Defining Dynamic Semantics
To define DS for ACLs we now introduce a state 
transition system in which each state specifies an ordinary
(static) commitment-based semantics and a range of
agent pairs for which these semantics are assumed to apply.
5
Note that we allow for requesting identical things before 
receiving a response and responding several times to the same
request. Simple additional conditions can be introduced to
avoid these effects which we omit here for lack of space. The
same is true of additional constraints to manage control flow
issues in actual dialogues (e.g. turn-taking).
6
This means that, for an appropriate variable substitution
ϑ, r |= pre(o)ϑ holds when o is applied at r and that CS(r)
is transformed according to post(o)ϑ after its application.

Figure 2: FSM-like state transition diagram 
describing the Δ-relation in a DS specification
Definition 3. A dynamic semantics (DS) is a structure
O, S, s0, Δ where
- O = {o1, o2, . . . , on} a set of dialogue operators,
- S ⊆ ℘(O) is a set of semantic states specified as 
subsets of dialogue operators which are valid in this state,
- s0 ∈ S is the initial semantic state,
- and the transition relation Δ ⊆ S × ℘(C) × ℘(Ag ×
Ag) × S defines the transitions over S triggered by
conditions expressed as elements of ℘(C) (C is the set
of all possible commitments).
The meaning of a transition (s, c, {(i1, j1), . . . , (in, jn)}, s ) ∈
Δ is as follows: Assume a mapping act : Ag × Ag → S
which specifies that the semantics of operators in s holds for
messages sent from i to j . Then, if CS ∈ c (i.e. the current
CS matches the constraint c given as a collection of possible
CSs) this will trigger a transition to state s for all pairs of
agents in {(i1, j1), . . . , (in, jn)} for which the constraint was
satisfied and will update act accordingly. In other words,
the act mapping tracks which version of the semantics is
valid for which pairs of communication partners over time.
2.4.2 Example
To illustrate these concepts, consider the following 
example: Let O = {RQ, RJ, AC, AC2}, S = {s0, s1} where
s0 = {RQ, RJ, AC} and s1 = {RQ, RJ, AC2}, i.e. there are
two possible states of the semantics which only differ in their
definition of accept (we call alternative versions of a single
dialogue operator like AC and AC2 semantic variants). We
assume that initially act(i, j) = s0 for all agents i, j ∈ Ag.
We describe δ by the transition diagram shown in figure 2.
In this diagram, edges carry labels c : A where c is a
constraint on the contents of CS followed by a description
of the set of agent pairs A for which the transition should
be made to the target state. Writing A(s) = act−1
(s) for
the so-called range of agent pairs for which s is active, we
use agent variables like i and j and the wildcard symbol ∗
that can be bound to any agent in A(s), and we assume that
this binding carries over to descriptions of A. For example,
the edge with label  ι, v : Γ i→j
∈ CS : {(i, ∗)} ∪ {(j, i)}
can be interpreted as follows: select all pairs (i, j) ∈ A(s0)
for which ι, v : Γ i→j
∈ CS applies (i.e. i has violated
some commitment toward j) and make s1 valid for the set
of agents {(i, k)|k ∈ A(s0)} ∪ {(j, i)}. This means that for
all agents i who have lied, s1 will become active for (i, j )
where j ∈ A(s0) and s1 will also become active for (j, i).
The way the DS of the diagram above works is as 
follows: initially the semantics says (for every agent i) that
they will fulfill any commitment truthfully (the use of AC
ensures that expected behaviour is equivalent to compliant
behaviour). If an agent i violates a commitment once then
s1 will become active for i towards all other agents, so that
they won"t expect i to fulfill any future commitments. 
Moreover, this will also apply to (j, i) so that the culprit i should
not expect the deceived agent j to keep its promises towards
i either in the future. However, this will not affect 
expectations regarding their interactions with i by agents other
than i (i.e. they still have no right to violate their own 
commitments). This reflects the idea that (only) agents that
have been fooled are allowed to trespass (only) against
those agents who trespassed against them. However, if
i ever fulfills any commitment again (after the latest 
violation, this is ensured by the complex constraint used as a
label for the transition from s1 to s0), the semantics in s0
will become valid for i again. In this case, though, s1 will
still be valid for the pair (j, i), i.e. agent j will regain trust
in i but cannot be expected to be trustworthy toward i ever
again.
Rather than suggesting that this is a particularly useful
communication-inherent mechanism for sanctioning and 
rewarding specific kinds of behaviour, this example serves to
illustrate the expressiveness of our framework and the kind
of distinctions it enables us to make.
2.4.3 Formal Semantics
The semantics of a DS can be defined inductively as 
follows: Let CS(r) denote the contents of the commitment
store after run r as before. We use the notation
A(δ, CS) = {(i, j)|CS|i,j ∈ c} ∩ A(s) ∩ A
to denote the set of agents that are to be moved from
s to s due to transition rule δ = (s, c, A, s ) ∈ Δ given
CS, where CS|i,j is the set of commitments that mention i
and/or j (in their sender/receiver/content slots). In other
words, A(δ, CS) contains those pairs of agents who are (i)
mentioned in the commitments covered by the constraint c,
(ii) contained in the range of s, and (iii) explicitly listed in A
as belonging to those pairs of agents that should be affected
by the transition δ.
104 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
Definition 4. The state of a dynamic semantics
O, S, s0, Δ after run r with immediate predecessor r
is defined as a mapping actr as follows:
1. r = ε: actε(i, j) = s0 for all i, j ∈ Ag
2. r = ε:
actr(i, j) =
8
><
>:
s if ∃δ = (s, c, A, s ) ∈ Δ.
(i, j) ∈ A(δ, CS(r))
actr (i, j) else
This maintains the property act−1
r (s) = act−1
r (s) −
A(δ, CS(r )), which specifies that the agent pairs to be
moved from s to s are removed from the range of s and
added to the range of s .
What is not ensured by this definition is consistency of the
state transition system, i.e. making sure that the semantic
successor state is uniquely identified for any state of the
commitment store and previous state so that every agent
pair is only assigned one active state in each step, i.e. actr
is actually a function for any r.7
2.4.4 Integration
Once the DS itself has been specified, we need to 
integrate the different components of our framework to monitor
the dynamics of our ACL semantics and its implications for
expected agent behaviour.
Starting with an initially empty commitment store CS
and initial semantic state s0 such that actε(i, j) = s0 for any
two agents i and j, the agent (or external observer) observes
(a partial subset of) everything that is communicated in the
system in each step. By applying the commitment transition
rules (D, A, S, F and V ) we can update CS accordingly,
ignoring any observed message sent from i to j that does
not syntactically match the dialogue operator set defined
in actr(i, j) for a current run r. After this update has been
performed for all observed messages and actions in this cycle,
which should not depend on the ordering of messages8
, we
can compute for any message sent from i to j the new value
of actr (i, j) depending on the semantic transition rules of
the DS if r is the successor run of r. With this, we can
then determine what the compliant and expected behaviour
of agents will be under these new conditions.
Thus, an agent can use information about expected 
behaviour in its own planning processes by assuming that all
agents involved will exhibit their expected (rather than just
compliant) behaviours. This prediction will not always be
more accurate than under normal (static) ACL semantics,
but since it is common knowledge that agents assume 
expected behaviour to occur (and, by virtue of the DS-ACL
specification, have the right to do that) most reasonable
dynamic ACL specifications will make provisions to ensure
that it is safer to assume expected rather than fully 
compliant behaviour if they want to promote their use by agents.
7
One way of ensuring this is to require that ∀s ∈
S. (∩{c|(s, c, A, s ) ∈ Δ(s)} = ∅) so that no two constraints
pertaining to outgoing edges of s can be fulfilled by CS at
a time. In some cases this may be too coarse-grained - it
would be sufficient for constraints to be mutually exclusive
for the same pair of agents at any point in time - but this
would have to be verified for an individual DS on a 
case-bycase basis.
8
This is the case for our operators, because their pre- and
post-conditions never concern or affect any commitments
other than those that involve both i and j - avoiding any
connection to third parties helps us keep the CS-update 
independent of the order in which observations are processed.
2.4.5 Complexity Issues
The main disadvantage of our approach is the space 
complexity of the dynamic ACL specification: If d is the number
of dialogue operators in a language and b is the maximum
number of semantic variants of a single dialogue operator
within this language, the DS specification would have to
specify O(db
) states. In many cases, however, most of the
speech acts will not have different variants (like RQ and
RJ in our example) and this may significantly reduce the
number of DS states that need to be specified.
As for the run-time behaviour of our semantics 
processing mechanism, we can assume that n messages/actions are
sent/performed in each processing step in a system with n
agents. Every commitment processing rule (D, S, etc.) has
to perform a pass over the contents of CS. In the worst case
every originally created commitment (of which there may be
nt after t steps) may have immediately become pending, 
active and violated (which doesn"t require any further physical
actions, so that every agent can create a new commitment
in each step).Thus, if any agent creates a new commitment
in each step without ever fulfilling it, this will result in the
total size of CS being in O(nt).9
Regarding semantic state transitions, as many as n 
different pairs of agents could be affected in a single iteration by n
messages. Assuming that the verification of CS-constraints
for these transitions would take O(nt), this yields a total 
update time of O(n2
t) for tracking DS evolution. This bound
can be reduced to O(n2
) if a quasi-stationarity 
assumption is made by limiting the window of earlier 
commitments that are being considered when verifying transition
constraints to a constant size (and thus obtaining a finite
set of possible commitment stores).10
