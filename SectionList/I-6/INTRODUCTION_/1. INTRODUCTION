The field of agent communication language (ACL) 
research has long been plagued by problems of verifiability
and grounding [10, 13, 17]. Early mentalistic semantics
that specify the semantics of speech acts in terms of 
preand post-conditions contingent on mental states of the 
participants (e.g. [3, 4, 12, 15]) lack verifiability regarding 
compliance of agents with the intended semantics (as the 
mental states of agents cannot be observed in open multiagent
systems (MASs)). Unable to safeguard themselves against
abuse by malicious, deceptive or malfunctioning agents,
mentalistic semantics are inherently unreliable and 
inappropriate for use in open MAS in which agents with potentially
conflicting objectives might deliberately exploit their 
adversaries" conceptions of message semantics to provoke a certain
behaviour.
Commitment-based semantics [6, 8, 14], on the other
hand, define the meaning of messages exchanged among
agents in terms of publicly observable commitments,
i.e. pledges to bring about a state of affairs or to perform 
certain actions. Such semantics solve the verifiability problem
as they allow for tracing the status of existing commitments
at any point in time given observed messages and actions
so that any observer can, for example, establish whether an
agent has performed a promised action. However, this can
only be done a posteriori, and this creates a grounding 
problem as no expectations regarding what will happen in the
future can be formed at the time of uttering or receiving a
message purely on the grounds of the ACL semantics.
Further, this implies that the semantics specification does
not provide an interface to agents" deliberation and 
planning mechanisms and hence it is unclear how rational agents
would be able to decide whether to subscribe to a suggested
ACL semantics when it is deployed.
Finally, none of the existing approaches allows the ACL
to specify how to respond to a violation of its semantics by
individual agents. This has two implications: Firstly, it is
left it up to the individual agent to reason about potential
violations, i.e. to bear the burden of planning its own 
reaction to others" non-compliant behaviour (e.g. in order to
sanction them) and to anticipate others" reactions to own
misconduct without any guidance from the ACL 
specification. Secondly, existing approaches fail to exploit the 
possibilities of sanctioning and rewarding certain behaviours in a
communication-inherent way by modifying the future 
meaning of messages uttered or received by compliant/deviant
agents.
In this paper, we propose dynamic semantics (DSs) for
ACLs as a solution to these problems. Our notion of DS
is based on the very simple idea of defining different 
alternatives for the meaning of individual speech acts (so-called
semantic variants) in an ACL semantics specification, and
transition rules between semantic states (i.e. collections of
variants for different speech acts) that describe the current
meaning of the ACL. These elements taken together result in
a FSM-like view of ACL specifications where each individual
state provides a complete ACL semantics and state 
transitions are triggered by observed agent behaviour in order to
(1) reflect future expectations based on previous interaction
experience and (2) sanction or reward certain kinds of 
behaviour.
In defining a DS framework for commitment-based ACLs,
this paper makes three contributions:
1. An extension of commitment-based ACL semantics to
provide an improved notion of grounding commitments
in agent interaction and to allow ACL specifications to
be directly used for planning-based rational decision
making.
2. A simple way of distinguishing between compliant and
expected behaviour with respect to an ACL 
specification that enables reasoning about the potential 
behaviour of agents purely from an ACL semantics 
perspective.
3. A mechanism for specifying how meaning evolves
with agent behaviour and how this can be used to
describe communication-inherent sanctioning and 
rewarding mechanisms essential to the design of open
MASs.
Furthermore, we discuss desiderata for DS design that can
be derived from our framework, present examples and 
analyse their properties.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2 introduces a formal framework for dynamic ACL 
semantics. In section 3 we present an analysis and discussion
of this framework and discuss desiderata for the design of
ACLs with dynamic semantics. Section 4 reviews related
approaches, and section 5 concludes.
