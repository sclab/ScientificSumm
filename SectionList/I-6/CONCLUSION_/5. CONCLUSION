This paper introduces dynamic semantics for ACLs as
a method for dealing with some fundamental problems of
agent communication in open systems, the simple 
underlying idea being that different courses of agent behaviour can
give rise to different interpretations of meaning of the 
messages exchanged among agents. Based on a common 
framework of commitment-based semantics, we presented a notion
of grounding for commitments based on notions of compliant
and expected behaviour. We then defined dynamic 
semantics as state transition systems over different semantic states
that can be viewed as different versions of ACL 
semantics in the traditional sense, and can be easily associated
with a planning-based view of reasoning about 
communication. Thereby, our focus was on simplicity and on providing
mechanisms for tracking semantic evolution in a 
down-toearth, algorithmic fashion to ensure applicability to many
different agent designs.
We discussed the properties of our framework showing
how it can be used as a powerful communication-inherent
mechanism for rewarding and sanctioning agent behaviour
in open systems without compromising agent autonomy, 
discussed its integration with agents" planning processes, 
complexity issues, and presented a list of desiderata for the 
design of ACLs with such semantics.
Currently, we are working on fully-fledged specifications
of dynamic semantics for more complex languages and on
extending our approach to mentalistic semantics where we
view statements about mental states as commitments 
regarding the rational implications of these mental states (a
simple example for this is that an agent commits itself to
dropping an ostensible intention that it is claiming to 
maintain if that intention turns out to be unachievable). In this
context, we are particularly interested in appropriate 
mechanisms to detect and respond to lying by interrogating
suspicious agents and forcing them to commit themselves
to (sets of) mental states publicly while sanctioning them
when these are inconsistent with their actions.
