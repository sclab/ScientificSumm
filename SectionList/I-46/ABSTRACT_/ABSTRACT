We propose a new class of representations that can be used for 
modeling (and model checking) temporal, strategic and epistemic 
properties of agents and their teams. Our representations borrow the
main ideas from interpreted systems of Halpern, Fagin et al.; 
however, they are also modular and compact in the way concurrent 
programs are. We also mention preliminary results on model checking
alternating-time temporal logic for this natural class of models.
