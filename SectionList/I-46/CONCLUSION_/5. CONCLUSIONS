We have presented a new class of representations for open 
multiagent systems. Our representations, called modular interpreted 
systems, are: modular, in the sense that components can be changed,
replaced, removed or added, with as little changes to the whole 
representation as possible; more compact than traditional explicit 
representations; and grounded, in the sense that the correspondences
between the primitives of the model and the entities being 
modeled are more immediate, giving a methodology for designing and
implementing systems. We also conjecture that the complexity of
model checking strategic ability for our representations is higher if
we assume perfect information than if we assume imperfect 
information.
The solutions, proposed in this paper, are not necessarily 
perfect (for example, the impression functions ini seem to be the
main source of non-modularity in MIS, and can be perhaps 
improved), but we believe them to be a step in the right direction.
We also do not mean to claim that our representations should 
replace more elaborate modeling languages like Promela or reactive
modules. We only suggest that there is a need for compact, modular
and reasonably grounded models that are more expressive than 
concurrent (epistemic) programs, and still allow for easier theoretical
analysis than reactive modules. We also suggest that MIS might be
better suited for modeling simple multi-agent domains, especially
for human-oriented (as opposed to computer-oriented) design.
