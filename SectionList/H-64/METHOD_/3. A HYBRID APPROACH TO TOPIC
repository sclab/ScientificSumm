DISCOVERY
To aid in the discovery of a new set of high-level topics for
the BLS website, we turned to unsupervised machine 
learning methods. In efforts to let the data speak for themselves,
we desired a means of concept discovery that would be based
not on the structure of the agency, but on the content of the
material. To begin this process, we crawled the BLS 
website, downloading all documents of MIME type text/html.
This led to a corpus of 15,165 documents. Based on this
corpus, we hoped to derive k ≈ 10 topical categories, such
that each document di is assigned to one or more classes.

Document clustering (cf. [16]) provided an obvious, but
only partial solution to the problem of automating this type
of high-level information architecture discovery. The 
problems with standard clustering are threefold.
1. Mutually exclusive clusters are inappropriate for 
identifying the topical content of documents, since 
documents may be about many subjects.
2. Due to the heterogeneity of the data housed in the
BLS collection (tables, lists, surveys, etc.), many 
documents" terms provide noisy topical information.
3. For application to the relation browser, we require a
small number (k ≈ 10) of topics. Without significant
data reduction, term-based clustering tends to deliver
clusters at too fine a level of granularity.
In light of these problems, we take a hybrid approach to
topic discovery. First, we limit the clustering process to
a sample of the entire collection, described in Section 4.
Working on a focused subset of the data helps to overcome
problems two and three, listed above. To address the 
problem of mutual exclusivity, we combine unsupervised with
supervised learning methods, as described in Section 5.
