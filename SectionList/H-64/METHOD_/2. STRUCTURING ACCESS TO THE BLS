WEBSITE
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is a federal government
agency charged with compiling and publishing statistics 
pertaining to labor and production in the US and abroad. Given
this broad mandate, the BLS publishes a wide array of 
information, intended for diverse audiences. The agency"s
website acts as a clearinghouse for this process. With over
15,000 text/html documents (and many more documents if
spreadsheets and typeset reports are included), providing
access to the collection provides a steep challenge to 
information architects.
2.1 The Relation Browser
The starting point of this work is the notion that access
to information in the BLS website could be improved by
the addition of a dynamic interface such as the relation
browser described by Marchionini and Brunk [13]. The 
relation browser allows users to traverse complex data sets by
iteratively slicing the data along several topics. In Figure
1 we see a prototype instantiation of the relation browser,
applied to the FedStats website3
.
The relation browser supports information seeking by 
allowing users to form queries in a stepwise fashion, slicing and
re-slicing the data as their interests dictate. Its motivation
is in keeping with Shneiderman"s suggestion that queries
and their results should be tightly coupled [2]. Thus in

ure 1, users might limit their search set to those documents
about energy. Within this subset of the collection, they
might further eliminate documents published more than a
year ago. Finally, they might request to see only documents
published in PDF format.
As Marchionini and Brunk discuss, capturing the 
publication date and format of documents is trivial. But successful
implementations of the relation browser also rely on topical
classification. This presents two stumbling blocks for system
designers:
• Information architects must define the appropriate set
of topics for their collection
• Site maintainers must classify each document into its
appropriate categories
These tasks parallel common problems in the metadata
community: defining appropriate elements and marking up
documents to support metadata-aware information access.
Given a collection of over 15,000 documents, these 
hurdles are especially daunting, and automatic methods of 
approaching them are highly desirable.
2.2 A Pre-Existing Structure
Prior to our involvement with the project, designers at
BLS created a shallow classificatory structure for the most
important documents in their website. As seen in Figure 2,
the BLS home page organizes 65 top-level documents into
15 categories. These include topics such as Employment and
Unemployment, Productivity, and Inflation and Spending.

We hoped initially that these pre-defined categories could
be used to train a 15-way document classifier, thus 
automating the process of populating the relation browser altogether.
However, this approach proved unsatisfactory. In personal
meetings, BLS officials voiced dissatisfaction with the 
existing topics. Their form, it was argued, owed as much to
the institutional structure of BLS as it did to the inherent
topology of the website"s information space. In other words,
the topics reflected official divisions rather than semantic
clusters. The BLS agents suggested that re-designing this
classification structure would be desirable.
The agents" misgivings were borne out in subsequent 
analysis. The BLS topics comprise a shallow classificatory 
structure; each of the 15 top-level categories is linked to a small
number of related pages. Thus there are 7 pages associated
with Inflation. Altogether, the link structure of this 
classificatory system contains 65 documents; that is, excluding
navigational links, there are 65 documents linked from the
BLS home page, where each hyperlink connects a document
to a topic (pages can be linked to multiple topics). Based on
this hyperlink structure, we defined M, a symmetric 65×65
matrix, where mij counts the number of topics in which 
documents i and j are both classified on the BLS home page. To
analyze the redundancy inherent in the pre-existing 
structure, we derived the principal components of M (cf. [11]).
Figure 3 shows the resultant scree plot4

Because all 65 documents belong to at least one BLS topic,

the rank of M is guaranteed to be less than or equal to
15 (hence, eigenvalues 16 . . . 65 = 0). What is surprising
about Figure 3, however, is the precipitous decline in 
magnitude among the first four eigenvalues. The four largest
eigenvlaues account for 62.2% of the total variance in the
data. This fact suggests a high degree of redundancy among
the topics. Topical redundancy is not in itself problematic.
However, the documents in this very shallow classificatory
structure are almost all gateways to more specific 
information. Thus the listing of the Producer Price Index under
three categories could be confusing to the site"s users. In
light of this potential for confusion and the agency"s own 
request for redesign, we undertook the task of topic discovery
described in the following sections.
