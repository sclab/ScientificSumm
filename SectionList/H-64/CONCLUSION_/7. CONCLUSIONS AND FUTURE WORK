Many developers and maintainers of digital libraries share
the basic problem pursued here. Given increasingly large,
complex bodies of data, how may we improve access to 
collections without incurring extraordinary cost, and while also
keeping systems receptive to changes in content over time?
Data mining and machine learning methods hold a great deal
of promise with respect to this problem. Empirical 
methods of knowledge discovery can aid in the organization and
retrieval of information. As we have argued in this paper,
these methods may also be brought to bear on the design
and implementation of advanced user interfaces.
This study explored a hybrid technique for aiding 
information architects as they implement dynamic interfaces such
as the relation browser. Our approach combines 
unsupervised learning techniques, applied to a focused subset of the
BLS website. The goal of this initial stage is to discover the
most basic and far-reaching topics in the collection. Based

on a statistical model of these topics, the second phase of
our approach uses supervised learning (in particular, a naive
Bayes classifier, trained on individual words), to assign 
topical relations to the remaining documents in the collection.
In the study reported here, this approach has 
demonstrated promise. In its favor, our approach is highly scalable.
It also appears to give fairly good results. Comparing three
modes of document representation-full-text, title only, and
keyword-we found 98% accuracy as measured by 
collocation of documents with identical subject headings. While it
is not surprising that editor-generated keywords should give
strong evidence for such learning, their superiority over 
fulltext and titles was dramatic, suggesting that even a small
amount of metadata can be very useful for data mining.
However, we also found evidence that learning topics from
a subset of the collection may lead to overfitted models.
After clustering 1279 Editor"s Desk documents into 10 
categories, we fitted a 10-way naive Bayes classifier to categorize
the remaining 14,000 documents in the collection. While we
saw fairly good results (classification accuracy of 75% with
respect to a small sample of human judges), this experiment
forced us to reconsider the quality of the topics learned by
clustering. The high correlation among human judgments
in our sample suggests that the topics discovered by 
analysis of the Editor"s Desk were not independent. While we do
not desire mutually exclusive categories in our setting, we
do desire independence among the topics we model.
Overall, then, the techniques described here provide an
encouraging start to our work on acquiring subject 
metadata for dynamic interfaces automatically. It also suggests
that a more sophisticated modeling approach might yield
158
better results in the future. In upcoming work we will 
experiment with streamlining the two-phase technique described
here. Instead of clustering documents to find topics and
then fitting a model to the learned clusters, our goal is to
expand the unsupervised portion of our analysis beyond a
narrow subset of the collection, such as The Editor"s Desk.
In current work we have defined algorithms to identify 
documents likely to help the topic discovery task. Supplied with
a more comprehensive training set, we hope to experiment
with model-based clustering, which combines the clustering
and classification processes into a single modeling procedure.
Topic discovery and document classification have long been
recognized as fundamental problems in information retrieval
and other forms of text mining. What is increasingly clear,
however, as digital libraries grow in scope and complexity,
is the applicability of these techniques to problems at the
front-end of systems such as information architecture and
interface design. Finally, then, in future work we will build
on the user studies undertaken by Marchionini and Brunk
in efforts to evaluate the utility of automatically populated
dynamic interfaces for the users of digital libraries.
