Text documents are a valuable resource for virtually any enterprise
and organization. Documents like papers, reports and general
business documentations contain a large part of today"s (business)
knowledge. Documents are mostly stored in a hierarchical folder
structure on file servers and it is difficult to organize them in regard
to classification, versioning etc., although it is of utmost importance
that users can find, retrieve and edit up-to-date versions of
documents whenever they want and, in a user-friendly way.
1.1 Problem Description
With most of the commonly used word-processing applications
documents can be manipulated by only one user at a time: tools for
pervasive collaborative document editing and management, are
rarely deployed in today"s world. Despite the fact, that people strive
for location- and time- independence, the importance of pervasive
collaborative work, i.e. collaborative document editing and
management is totally neglected. Documents could therefore be
seen as a vulnerable source in today"s world, which demands for an
appropriate solution: The need to store, retrieve and edit these
documents collaboratively anytime, everywhere and with almost
every suitable device and with guaranteed mechanisms for security,
consistency, availability and access control, is obvious.
In addition, word processing systems ignore the fact that the history
of a text document contains crucial information for its management.
Such meta data includes creation date, creator, authors, version,
location-based information such as time and place when/where a
user reads/edits a document and so on. Such meta data can be
gathered during the documents creation process and can be used
versatilely. Especially in the field of pervasive document
management, meta data is of crucial importance since it offers
totally new ways of organizing and classifying documents: On the
one hand, the user"s actual situation influences the user"s objectives.
Meta data could be used to give the user the best possible view on
the documents, dependent of his actual information. On the other
hand, as soon as the user starts to work, i.e. reads or edits a
document, new meta data can be gathered in order to make the
system more adaptable and in a sense to the users situation and, to
offer future users a better view on the documents.
As far as we know, no system exists, that satisfies the
aforementioned requirements. A very good overview about 
realtime communication and collaboration system is described in [7].
We therefore strive for a pervasive document editing and
management system, which enables pervasive (and collaborative)
document editing and management: users should be able to read and
edit documents whenever, wherever, with whomever and with
whatever device.
In this paper, we present collaborative database-based real-time
word processing, which provides pervasive document editing and
management functionality. It enables the user to work on
documents collaboratively and offers sophisticated document
management facility: the user is always served with up-to-date
documents and can organize and manage documents on the base of
meta data. Additionally document data is treated as ‘first class
citizen" of the database as demanded in [1].
1.2 Underlying Concepts
The concept of our pervasive document editing and management
system requires an appropriate architectural foundation. Our
concept and implementation are based on the TeNDaX [3]
collaborative database-based document editing and management
system, which enables pervasive document editing and managing.
TeNDaX is a Text Native Database eXtension. It enables the
storage of text in databases in a native form so that editing text is
finally represented as real-time transactions. Under the term ‘text
editing" we understand the following: writing and deleting text
(characters), copying & pasting text, defining text layout &
structure, inserting notes, setting access rights, defining business
processes, inserting tables, pictures, and so on i.e. all the actions
regularly carried out by word processing users. With ‘real-time
transaction" we mean that editing text (e.g. writing a
character/word) invokes one or several database transactions so that
everything, which is typed appears within the editor as soon as these
objects are stored persistently. Instead of creating files and storing
them in a file system, the content and all of the meta data belonging
to the documents is stored in a special way in the database, which
enables very fast real-time transactions for all editing tasks [2].
The database schema and the above-mentioned transactions are
created in such a way that everything can be done within a 
multiuser environment, as is usual done by database technology. As a
consequence, many of the achievements (with respect to data
organization and querying, recovery, integrity and security
enforcement, multi-user operation, distribution management,
uniform tool access, etc.) are now, by means of this approach, also
available for word processing.
