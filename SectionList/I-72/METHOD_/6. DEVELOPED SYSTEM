We have implemented our architecture in Java. To ease testing
of the system, the consumer agent has a user interface that allows
us to enter various requests. The producer agent is fully automated
and the learning and service offering operations work as explained
before. In this section, we explain the implementation details of the
developed system.
We use OWL [11] as our ontology language and JENA as our
ontology reasoner. The shared ontology is the modified version of
the Wine Ontology [19]. It includes the description of wine as a
concept and different types of wine. All participants of the 
negotiation use this ontology for understanding each other. According
to the ontology, seven properties make up the wine concept. The
consumer agent and the producer agent obtain the possible values
for the these properties by querying the ontology. Thus, all 
possible values for the components of the wine concept such as color,
body, sugar and so on can be reached by both agents. Also a 
variety of wine types are described in this ontology such as Burgundy,
Chardonnay, CheninBlanc and so on. Intuitively, any wine type 
described in the ontology also represents a wine concept. This allows
us to consider instances of Chardonnay wine as instances of Wine
class.
In addition to wine description, the hierarchical information of
some features can be inferred from the ontology. For instance,
we can represent the information Europe Continent covers 
Western Country. Western Country covers French Region, which covers
some territories such as Loire, Bordeaux and so on. This 
hierarchical information is used in estimation of semantic similarity. In this
part, some reasoning can be made such as if a concept X covers Y
and Y covers Z, then concept X covers Z. For example, Europe
Continent covers Bordeaux.

For some features such as body, flavor and sugar, there is no
hierarchical information, but their values are semantically leveled.
When that is the case, we give the reasonable similarity values for
these features. For example, the body can be light, medium, or
strong. In this case, we assume that light is 0.66 similar to medium
but only 0.33 to strong.
WineStock Ontology is the producer"s inventory and describes
a product class as WineProduct. This class is necessary for the
producer to record the wines that it sells. Ontology involves the 
individuals of this class. The individuals represent available services
that the producer owns. We have prepared two separate WineStock
ontologies for testing. In the first ontology, there are 19 available
wine products and in the second ontology, there are 50 products.
