We review the recent literature in comparison to our work. Tama
et al. [16] propose a new approach based on ontology for 
negotiation. According to their approach, the negotiation protocols used
in e-commerce can be modeled as ontologies. Thus, the agents can
perform negotiation protocol by using this shared ontology without
the need of being hard coded of negotiation protocol details. While

Tama et al. model the negotiation protocol using ontologies, we
have instead modeled the service to be negotiated. Further, we have
built a system with which negotiation preferences can be learned.
Sadri et al. study negotiation in the context of resource 
allocation [14]. Agents have limited resources and need to require 
missing resources from other agents. A mechanism which is based on
dialogue sequences among agents is proposed as a solution. The
mechanism relies on observe-think-action agent cycle. These 
dialogues include offering resources, resource exchanges and offering
alternative resource. Each agent in the system plans its actions to
reach a goal state. Contrary to our approach, Sadri et al."s study is
not concerned with learning preferences of each other.
Brzostowski and Kowalczyk propose an approach to select an 
appropriate negotiation partner by investigating previous multi-attribute
negotiations [1]. For achieving this, they use case-based reasoning.
Their approach is probabilistic since the behavior of the partners
can change at each iteration. In our approach, we are interested in
negotiation the content of the service. After the consumer and 
producer agree on the service, price-oriented negotiation mechanisms
can be used to agree on the price.
Fatima et al. study the factors that affect the negotiation such as
preferences, deadline, price and so on, since the agent who 
develops a strategy against its opponent should consider all of them [5].
In their approach, the goal of the seller agent is to sell the service
for the highest possible price whereas the goal of the buyer agent
is to buy the good with the lowest possible price. Time interval 
affects these agents differently. Compared to Fatima et al. our focus
is different. While they study the effect of time on negotiation, our
focus is on learning preferences for a successful negotiation.
Faratin et al. propose a multi-issue negotiation mechanism, where
the service variables for the negotiation such as price, quality of
the service, and so on are considered traded-offs against each other
(i.e., higher price for earlier delivery) [4]. They generate a 
heuristic model for trade-offs including fuzzy similarity estimation and a
hill-climbing exploration for possibly acceptable offers. Although
we address a similar problem, we learn the preferences of the 
customer by the help of inductive learning and generate counter-offers
in accordance with these learned preferences. Faratin et al. only
use the last offer made by the consumer in calculating the 
similarity for choosing counter offer. Unlike them, we also take into 
account the previous requests of the consumer. In their experiments,
Faratin et al. assume that the weights for service variables are fixed
a priori. On the contrary, we learn these preferences over time.
In our future work, we plan to integrate ontology reasoning into
the learning algorithm so that hierarchical information can be learned
from subsumption hierarchy of relations. Further, by using 
relationships among features, the producer can discover new 
knowledge from the existing knowledge. These are interesting directions
that we will pursue in our future work.
