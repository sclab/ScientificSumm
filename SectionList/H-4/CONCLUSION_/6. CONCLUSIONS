This paper has focused on overcoming the difficulties 
involved in performing PIM evaluations. The personal nature
of PIM means that it is difficult to construct balanced 
experiments because participants each have their own unique
collections that are self-generated by completing other tasks.
We suggested that to incorporate the personal aspects of
PIM in evaluations, the performance of systems or users
should be examined when users complete tasks on their own
collections. This approach itself has problems because task
creation for personal collections is difficult: researchers don"t
know much about the kinds of re-finding tasks people 
perform and they don"t know what information is within 
individual personal collections. In this paper we described ways
of overcoming these challenges to facilitate task based PIM
user evaluations.
In the first part of the paper we performed a diary study
that examined the tasks that caused people to re-find email
messages and web pages. The collected data included a wide
range of both work and non-work related tasks, and based on
the data we created a taxonomy of web and email re-finding
tasks. We discovered that people perform three main types
of re-finding task: tasks that require specific information
from within a single resource, tasks that require a single
complete resource, and tasks that require information to be
recovered from multiple resources. In the second part of the
paper, we discussed the significance of the taxonomy with
respect to PIM evaluation. We demonstrated that balanced
experiments could be conducted comparing system or user
performance on the task categories within the taxonomy.
We also suggested two methods of creating tasks that can
be completed on personal collections. These methods do
not compromise the privacy of study participants. We 
examined the techniques suggested, firstly by simulating an 
experimental situation - participants were asked to re-perform
their own tasks as they recorded them, and secondly, in the
context of a full evaluation. Performing evaluations in this
way will allow systems that have been proposed to improve
users" ability to manage and re-find their information to be
tested, so that we can learn about the needs and desires
of users. Thus, this paper has offered two contributions to
the field: an increased understanding of PIM behaviour at
the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate
further investigations.
