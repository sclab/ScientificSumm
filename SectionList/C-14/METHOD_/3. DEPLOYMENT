In this section, the problem of sensor deployment for 
unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are
identified.
3.1 Problem formulation
Consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized 
traversal using a sensor network. The target to traverse the sensor
field emits a given energy level K and the stochastic of the
noise in the region is known. The sensors are to be deployed
over the region in a random fashion where the sensors 
locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the
number or density of sensors can be chosen. The problem is
to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired 
performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the
region.
This performance is measured by the false alarm 
probability and the path exposure defined in section 2. The false
alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement
and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed
and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms. It is 
assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists
of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.
Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the
goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least
exposed path in the region.
Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases
(if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are
deployed in the region. However, since the deployment is
random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure
level is achieved for a given number of sensors. Indeed some
sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability,
in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same
vicinity. A study of the statistical distribution of exposure
for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors
can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level
is achieved. In practical situations, only a limited number
of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited
detection level with associated confidence level is achievable
at a given false alarm rate.
3.2 Solution
Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method
to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors
can be used. Deploying the M sensors results in the 
maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when
considering the cost of sensors. To reduce the number of
sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be
deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.
The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to
determine if it satisfies the desired performance level. If it
does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the 
desired exposure level is reached or until the all M available
sensors are deployed.
The number of sensors used in this strategy can be 
minimized by deploying one sensor at a time. However, a cost is
usually associated with each deployment of sensors and 
deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the
cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the
cost of single sensors. By assigning a cost to both single 
sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be
deployed at first and thereafter can be determined. In the
next section, we develop analytical expressions for finding
the optimal solution. In general, the optimal cost solution
is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all
the sensors at a time.
