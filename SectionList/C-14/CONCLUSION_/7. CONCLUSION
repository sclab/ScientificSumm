This paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment
in a region to be monitored for target intrusion. A 
mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection
is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths
through the region. The minimum exposure is used as a
measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to
maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the 
region.
In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region
to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in
steps is developed. The strategy consists of deploying a 
limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum
exposure is achieved. The cost function used in this study
depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and
the cost of each deployment. Through simulation, the 
distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random 
deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed.
These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment
for varying number of sensors deployed in each step.
We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in
each step varies with the relative cost assigned to 
deployment and sensors. The results of this study can be extended
to larger regions with different target parameters. The 
solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by 
considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step
and this multiple variables problem requires further 
investigation.
