In this section, we present results of simulations that were
conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of
the number of sensors deployed.
5.1 Method
The exposure distribution is obtained by collecting 
statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a
predefined region. The random deployment is assumed to
be uniformly distributed over the region, which is a local 
approximation. For every deployment, the minimum exposure
is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm 
presented in section 2. A decay factor of k = 2 and maximum
energy of K = 60 are chosen to model the energy emitted
by targets (cf Equation 1). The region monitored is of size
20Ã—20 with a noise (AWGN) of variance 1, so that the signal
coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is
8 or more units length away from a sensor. The sensors use
value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision
on the presence of a target in the region. The threshold for
detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors
to give a constant false alarm probability. The false alarm
probability for each detection attempt is chosen so that the
probability to get one or more false alarm along a path of
length 20 units (corresponding to 20 detection attempts by
the sensors) is 5%.

5.2 Distribution of minimum exposure
The distribution of minimum exposure were found for the
number of sensor deployed varying from 1 to 40. To 
illustrate our results, the probability density functions for 5, 10
and 15 sensors are shown in Figure 4.
We observe that for 5 sensors deployed, the minimum 
exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm
probability of .04. The highest density is obtained for 
values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero
for higher values of exposure. For deployment of 10 sensors,
we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density
for values below .04, then increases and has about constant
density for values lying between .1 and .98. We also observe
a peak of density around 1. For deployment of 15 sensors,
densities start at zero for small values and remain very small
for most values of minimum exposure. The density slowly
increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1.
As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average
as the number of sensors deployed increases. When 
randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a
placement providing a desirable minimum exposure. When
deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally
likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a 
desirable exposure level. When deploying 15 sensors, it is very
likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and
this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors
deployed.
We use the cumulative distribution function obtained from
the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the 
desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of
sensors. The graph of Figure 5 shows the probability that
the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the 
number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%.
These values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in
Equation 4. The graph shows that the confidence level to
obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the
number of sensors deployed. The confidence for ed when 
deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most
applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the 
distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors.
