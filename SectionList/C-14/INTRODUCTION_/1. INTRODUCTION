Recent advances in computing hardware and software are
responsible for the emergence of sensor networks capable of
observing the environment, processing the data and making
decisions based on the observations. Such a network can
be used to monitor the environment, detect, classify and 
locate specific events, and track targets over a specific region.
Examples of such systems are in surveillance, monitoring of
pollution, traffic, agriculture or civil infrastructures [6]. The
deployment of sensor networks varies with the application
considered. It can be predetermined when the environment
is sufficiently known and under control, in which case the
sensors can be strategically hand placed. The deployment
can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is
unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be 
airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means, 
generally resulting in a random placement.
This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor
networks performing target detection over a region of 
interest. In order to detect a target moving through the region,
sensors have to make local observations of the environment
and collaborate to produce a global decision that reflects the
status of the region covered [2]. This collaboration requires
local processing of the observations, communication between
different nodes, and information fusion [7]. Since the local
observations made by the sensors depend on their position,
the performance of the detection algorithm is a function of
the deployment. One possible measure of the goodness of
deployment for target detection is called path exposure. It is
a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing
the region using a given path. The higher the path 
exposure, the better the deployment. The set of paths to be
considered may be constrained by the environment. For 
example, if the target is expected to be following a road, only
the paths consisting of the roads need to be considered.
In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random
which corresponds to many practical applications where the
region to be monitored is not accessible for precise 
placement of sensors. The focus of this paper is to determine the
number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target 
detection in a region of interest. The tradeoffs lie between the
network performance, the cost of the sensors deployed, and
the cost of deploying the sensors. This paper is organized
as follows. In section 2, a definition for path exposure is
proposed and a method to evaluate the exposure of a given
path is developed. In section 3, the problem of random 
deployment is formulated and several solutions are presented.
An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4
and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in
section 6 to determine the optimum solution for a given 
environment. The paper concludes with section 7.
