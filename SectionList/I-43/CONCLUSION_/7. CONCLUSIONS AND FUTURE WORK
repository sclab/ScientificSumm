In this paper, we have presented a novel perspective on the 
process of planning and control in stochastic environments, in the form
of the Dynamics Based Control (DBC) framework. DBC 
formulates the task of planning as support of a specified target system 
dynamics, which describes the necessary properties of change within
the environment. Optimality of DBC plans of action are measured

We show that a recently developed technique of Extended Markov
Tracking (EMT) [13] is an instantiation of DBC. In fact, EMT can
be seen as a specific case of DBC parameterization, which employs
a greedy action selection procedure.
Since EMT exhibits the key features of the general DBC 
framework, as well as polynomial time complexity, we used the 
multitarget version of EMT [15] to demonstrate that the class of area
sweeping problems naturally lends itself to dynamics-based 
descriptions, as instantiated by our experiments in the Tag Game 
domain.
As enumerated in Section 4.2, EMT has a number of 
limitations, such as difficulty in dealing with negative dynamic 
preference. This prevents direct application of EMT to such problems
as Rendezvous-Evasion Games (e.g., [6]). However, DBC in 
general has no such limitations, and readily enables the formulation
of evasion games. In future work, we intend to proceed with the
development of dynamics-based controllers for these problems.
