ity that a multi-dimensional contract will be successfully fulfilled,
we now go on to consider how agents within an open multi-agent
system can communicate these estimates to one another. This is
commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited
direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions.
Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby
reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient 
statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11]. This approach is attractive since
these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract 
outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of 
contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully
fulfilled, n). Under the probabilistic framework of the beta 
distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with
an agent"s own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise
estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.
We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional
case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the 
sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta 
distribution. In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the
agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which
are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by:
N =< nab
ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18)
Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of
its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers
(where d is the number of contract dimensions). For instance, in
the case of three dimensions, N, is given by:
N =< nab
00, nab
01, nab
10, nab
11, nac
00, nac
01, nac
10, nac
11, nbc
00, nbc
01, nbc
10, nbc

and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated
within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.
Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply 
aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a
more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.
Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here,
by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and
Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such
as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering 
inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within
this multi-dimensional model. However, we now go on to consider
a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional
models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated 
sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks.
