Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first 
introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the
more familiar single dimensional case. We consider an agent who
must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier.
This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that
o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2
.
In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should 
consider the utility that it will derive from this contract. We assume
that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent
derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3
. Now,
given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the
supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected
utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by:
E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1)
where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully
fulfill the contract. However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the
agent, p(o = 1) is not. The best the agent can do is to determine
a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct
experience of previous contract outcomes. Given that it has been
able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected
utility4
of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty
in this expected utility, Var(E[U]). This uncertainty is important
since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract,

Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although
extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work.

Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is 
derived from an unsuccessful outcome.

Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and
this is the notation that we adopt here [2].

not only on its estimate of the expected utility of the contract, but
also on the probability that the expected utility will exceed some
minimum amount. These two properties are given by:
E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2)
Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2
(3)
where ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) are the estimate and 
uncertainty of the probability that a contract will be successfully 
fulfilled, and are calculated from the distribution over possible values
of p(o = 1) that the agent determines from its direct experience.
The utility based approach that we present here provides an 
attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11].
Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta 
distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible
values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known
to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3]. By adopting
the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1))
using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous
contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then:
ˆp(o = 1) =
n + 1
N + 2
and:
Var(p(o = 1)) =
(n + 1)(N − n + 1)
(N + 2)2(N + 3)
Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent
observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus,
the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will
be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1).
