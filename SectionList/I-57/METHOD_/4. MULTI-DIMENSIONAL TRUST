We now extend the description above, to consider contracts 
between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple 
dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be
decomposed into the success or failure of each separate 
dimension. Consider again the example of the supply chain that 
specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to
be delivered. Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now 
indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and
oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one. A contract outcome, X,
is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes
(e.g. X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .}).
Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described
by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to
make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will
derive from this contract. To this end, we can make the general
statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by:
E[U] = p(X)U(X)T
(4)
where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible 
contract outcomes:
p(X) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .)
p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .)
p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .)
...
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
(5)
and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes:
U(X) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .)
u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .)
u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .)
...
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
(6)
As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability 
distribution p(X) is not. Rather, given the agent"s direct experience
of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible
values for p(X). In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution
was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1). In the
multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of 
probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution,
since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].
Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an 
estimate of the expected utility of a contract. As before, this estimate
is itself represented by an expected value given by:
E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T
(7)
and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility:
Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T
(8)
where:
Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T
] (9)
Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust
model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of 
probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along
with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this 
probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an 
estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance
matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given
the observed contractual outcomes. At this point, it is interesting
to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1),
has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agent"s
belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a 
contract. However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must 
determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible
contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled,
this direct semantic interpretation is not present. In the next 
section, we describe the exemplar utility function that we shall use in
the remainder of this paper.
4.1 Exemplar Utility Function
The approach described so far is completely general, in that it 
applies to any utility function of the form described above, and also
applies to the estimation of any joint probability distribution. In
the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit
the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits
a dependence upon the correlations between the contract 
dimensions. That is, we consider the case that expected utility is 
dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension
being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities:
U(X) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
u(oa = 1)
u(ob = 1)
u(oc = 1)
...
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
(10)
Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract
dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear 
semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case:
ˆp(X) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
ˆp(oa = 1)
ˆp(ob = 1)
ˆp(oc = 1)
...
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
(11)
The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the 
uncertainty in the expected utility. To see this, consider the covariance
1072 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
matrix that describes this uncertainty, Cov(p(X)), is now given by:
Cov(p(X)) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
Va Cab Cac . . .
Cab Vb Cbc . . .
Cac Cbc Vc . . .
...
...
...
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
(12)
In this matrix, the diagonal terms, Va, Vb and Vc, represent the
uncertainties in p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) and p(oc = 1) within
p(X). The off-diagonal terms, Cab, Cac and Cbc, represent the
correlations between these probabilities. In the next section, we use
the Dirichlet distribution to calculate both ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X))
from an agent"s direct experience of previous contract outcomes.
We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an 
alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby
an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and
thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as
in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3). This
is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the
covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero. However, doing so can
lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of
the contract is more accurate than it actually is. To illustrate this,
consider a specific scenario with the following values: u(oa =
1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 and Va = Vb = 0.2. In this case,
Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), and thus, if the correlation Cab is
ignored then the variance in the expected utility is 0.4. However, if
the contract outcomes are completely correlated then Cab = 1 and
Var(E[U]) is actually 0.8. Thus, in order to have an accurate 
estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make
a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to 
represent and calculate these correlation terms. In the next section, we
describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution.
4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution
In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct 
experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet
distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each
contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a 
measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the
correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).
We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms
of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)). As described above, the
derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single 
dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes,
n are successfully fulfilled. In the multi-dimensional case, 
however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number
of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions
were successfully fulfilled. Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet
parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can 
estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully
fulfilled:
ˆp(oa = 1) =
αa
α0
=
na + 1
N + 2
and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension:
Va =
αa(α0 − αa)
α2
0(1 + α0)
=
(na + 1)(N − na + 1)
(N + 2)2(N + 3)
However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is
more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations 
between the contract dimensions. Thus, for each pair of dimensions
(i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of 
contract outcomes, and thus we define nab
ij as the number of contract
outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j. For example, nab
10
represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0.
Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab
ij
nab
ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate
the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that
the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is:
Prob(pab) = Kab
i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1}
p(oa = i, ob = j)αab
ij −1
where:
i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1}
p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1
and Kab is a normalising constant [3]. From this we can derive
pair-wise probability estimates and variances:
E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] =
αab
ij
α0
(13)
V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] =
αab
ij (α0 − αab
ij )
α2
0(1 + α0)
(14)
where:
α0 =
i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1}
αab
ij (15)
and in fact, α0 = N + 2, where N is the total number of contracts
observed. Likewise, we can express the covariance in these 
pairwise probabilities in similar terms:
C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] =
−αab
ij αab
mn
α2
0(1 + α0)
Finally, we can use the expression:
p(oa = 1) =
j∈{0,1}
p(oa = 1, ob = j)
to determine the covariance Cab. To do so, we first simplify the
notation by defining V ab
ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] and Cab
ijmn
C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. The covariance for the
probability of positive contract outcomes is then the covariance 
between j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) and i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob =
1), and thus:
Cab = Cab
1001 + Cab
1101 + Cab
1011 + V ab
11 .
Thus, given a set of contract outcomes that represent the agent"s
previous interactions with a supplier, we may use the Dirichlet 
distribution to calculate the mean and variance of the probability of
any contract dimension being successfully fulfilled (i.e. ˆp(oa = 1)
and Va). In addition, by a somewhat more complex procedure we
can also calculate the correlations between these probabilities (i.e.
Cab). This allows us to calculate an estimate of the probability that
any contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(X), and
also represent the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities
by the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)). In turn, these results may be
used to calculate the estimate and uncertainty in the expected 
utility of the contract. In the next section we present empirical results
that show that in practise this formalism yields significant 
improvements in these estimates compared to the na¨ıve approximation 
using multiple independent beta distributions.
4.3 Empirical Comparison
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our formalism, and show
the importance of the off-diagonal terms in Cov(p(X)), we 
compare two approaches:

utility and (ii) the information content of the estimates 
computed using the Dirichlet distribution and multiple independent
beta distributions. Results are averaged over 106
runs, and the
error bars show the standard error in the mean.
• Dirichlet Distribution: We use the full Dirichlet 
distribution, as described above, to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X))
including all its off-diagonal terms that represent the 
correlations between the contract dimensions.
• Independent Beta Distributions: We use independent beta
distributions to represent each contract dimension, in order
to calculate ˆp(X), and then, as described earlier, we 
approximate Cov(p(X)) and ignore the correlations by setting all
the off-diagonal terms to zero.
We consider a two-dimensional case where u(oa = 1) = 6 and
u(ob = 1) = 2, since this allows us to plot ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X))
as ellipses in a two-dimensional plane, and thus explain the 
differences between the two approaches. Specifically, we initially 
allocate the agent some previous contract outcomes that represents its
direct experience with a supplier. The number of contracts is drawn
uniformly between 10 and 20, and the actual contract outcomes are
drawn from an arbitrary joint distribution intended to induce 
correlations between the contract dimensions. For each set of 
contracts, we use the approaches described above to calculate ˆp(X)
and Cov(p(X)), and hence, the variance in the expected contract
utility, Var(E[U]). In addition, we calculate a scalar measure of the
information content, I, of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)), which
is a standard way of measuring the uncertainty encoded within the
covariance matrix [1]. More specifically, we calculate the 
determinant of the inverse of the covariance matrix:
I = det(Cov(p(X))−1
) (16)
and note that the larger the information content, the more precise
ˆp(X) will be, and thus, the better the estimate of the expected 
utility that the agent is able to calculate. Finally, we use the results

(17)
where Cab, Va and Vb are calculated as described in section 4.2.
The results of this analysis are shown in figure 1. Here we show
the values of I and Var(E[U]) calculated by the agents, plotted
against the correlation of the contract outcomes, ρ, that constituted
their direct experience. The results are averaged over 106

simulation runs. Note that as expected, when the dimensions of the 
contract outcomes are uncorrelated (i.e. ρ = 0), then both approaches
give the same results. However, the value of using our formalism
with the full Dirichlet distribution is shown when the correlation
between the dimensions increases (either negatively or positively).
As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with
multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation 
information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is
lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower.
The loss of this correlation information leads the variance of the
expected utility of the contract to be incorrect (either over or under
estimated depending on the correlation)5
, with the exact amount of
mis-estimation depending on the actual utility function chosen (i.e.
the values of u(oa = 1) and u(ob = 1)).
In addition, in figure 2 we illustrate an example of the estimates
calculated through both methods, for a single exemplar set of 
contract outcomes. We represent the probability estimates, ˆp(X), and
the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), in the standard way as an 
ellipse [1]. That is, ˆp(X) determines the position of the center of
the ellipse, Cov(p(X)) defines its size and shape. Note that whilst
the ellipse resulting from the full Dirichlet formalism accurately 
reflects the true distribution (samples of which are plotted as points),
that calculated by using multiple independent Beta distributions
(and thus ignoring the correlations) results in a much larger ellipse
that does not reflect the true distribution. The larger size of this
ellipse is a result of the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix
being set to zero, and corresponds to the agent miscalculating the
uncertainty in the probability of each contract dimension being 
fulfilled. This, in turn, leads it to miscalculate the uncertainty in the
expected utility of a contract (shown in figure 1 as Var(E[U]).
