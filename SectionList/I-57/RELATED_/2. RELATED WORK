The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised
by a number of researchers. Sabater and Sierra present a model of
reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple 
variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as
subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts. They 
provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form
a measure they call subjective reputation.
Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of
different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and 
quality [4]. In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number
that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic 
meaning. He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based
on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic
function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a
single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers. Whilst,
he comments that the trust values could have some associated 
confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.
Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model
over multiple domain specific dimensions [5]. They define 
multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff
based on a supplier"s estimated behaviour. These estimates are,
however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several
agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty. Nevertheless,
they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple
dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.
By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more 
principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit
limited to a single dimension. Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta
Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled
from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have
interacted with it [6]. The beta distribution represents a natural
choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a
principled means of representing uncertainty. Moreover, they 
provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an 
approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient 
statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of
agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques
to deal with reputations that may change over time.
Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an
agent"s belief in the probability that another agent will 
successfully fulfill its commitments [11]. They present a formalism using
a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability
based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient
statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other
agents. They provide a number of extensions to this initial model,
and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always 
truthfully report their trust estimates. Thus, they present a principled
approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.
Our work builds upon these more principled approaches. 
However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that
is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract. We show
that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must 
estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.
In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model
using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et
al.). However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple
dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta 
distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agent"s
belief over multiple dimensions.
