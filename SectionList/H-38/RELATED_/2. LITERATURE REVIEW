The importance of a Web page is determined by either
the textual content of pages or the hyperlink structure or
both. As in previous work [7, 13], we focus on ranking
methods solely determined by hyperlink structure of the
Web graph. All the mentioned ranking algorithms are 
established on a graph. For our convenience, we first give some
notations. Denote a static graph by G = (V, E), where V =
{v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to
vj}. Ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of
page i respectively.
2.1 PageRank
The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective
matter, which depends on the reader"s interests, knowledge
and attitudes [13]. However, the average importance of all
readers can be considered as an objective matter. PageRank
tries to find such average importance based on the Web link
structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of
statistical data. The Web is modelled by a directed graph G
in the PageRank algorithms, and the rank or importance
xi for page vi ∈ V is defined recursively in terms of pages
which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈E aijxj, where aij is assumed
to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise. Or
in matrix terms, x = Ax. When the concept of random
jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to
x = [(1 − α)g1T
+ αA]x, (1)
where α is the probability of following the actual link from a
page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump,
and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T
g = 1. Typically, α =
0.85, and g = 1
n
1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is
the vector of all ones [6, 13].
2.2 TrustRank
TrustRank [7] is composed of two parts. The first part
is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse 
PageRank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good
node. The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank,
in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by
all the trusted pages found in the first part. Moreover, the
initial input of x is also set to be g. The justification for
the inverse PageRank and the solid experiments support its
advantage in combating the Web spam. Although there are
many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based
ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for
comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for 
combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a 
comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with
PageRank and DiffusionRank.
2.3 Manifold Ranking
In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was 
proposed. The data points represented as vectors in Euclidean
space are considered to be drawn from a manifold. From
the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted
graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the
Gaussian Kernel smoothing. While the manifold ranking
algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images,
the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general 
personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph
setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons.
2.4 Heat Diffusion
Heat diffusion is a physical phenomena. In a medium,
heat always flow from position with high temperature to
position with low temperature. Heat kernel is used to 
describe the amount of heat that one point receives from 
another point. Recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold
is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3]
and classification [9, 10, 14]. In these work, the input data
is considered to lie in a special structure.
All the above topics are related to our work. The readers
can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in
order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first
part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on
the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion
is a main scheme in this paper.
