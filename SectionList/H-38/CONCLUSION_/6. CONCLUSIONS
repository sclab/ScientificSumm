We conclude that DiffusionRank is a generalization of
PageRank, which is interesting in that the heat diffusion 
coefficient γ can balance the extent that we want to model the
original Web graph and the extent that we want to reduce
the effect of link manipulations. The experimental results
show that we can actually achieve such a balance by 
setting γ = 1, although the best setting including varying γi
is still under further investigation. This anti-manipulation
feature enables DiffusionRank to be a candidate as a 
penicillin for Web spamming. Moreover, DiffusionRank can be
employed to find group-group relations and to partition Web
graph into small communities. All these advantages can be
achieved in the same computational complexity as 
PageRank. For the special application of anti-manipulation, 
DiffusionRank performs best both in reduction effects and in
its stability among all the three algorithms.
