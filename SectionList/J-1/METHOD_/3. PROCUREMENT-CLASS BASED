DOMAINS
This section focuses on the problems that are 
procurementclass based domains. For this domain, we present an 
algorithm called GTR-1, which given a mechanism that is IR
and IC outputs a mechanism with reduced welfare which is
IR, IC and budget balanced.
Although procurement class domains appear to be a 
relatively restricted model, in fact many domains studied in the
literature are procurement class domains.
Example 3.1. The following domains are procurement
class domains:
• double-sided auctions with homogenous goods 
[13](problem B.1). In this domain there are two classes. The
class of buyers and the class of sellers. Each 
procurement set consists of a single buyer and a single seller.
Since every pair of (buyer, seller) is a valid 
procurement set (albeit possible with negative value) this is a
procurement class domain. In this domain the constant
assigned to the procurement sets is F = 0.
• Spatially distributed markets with non strategic edges
[3, 9](problem B.3). Like the double-sided auctions
with homogenous goods, their are two classes in the 
domain. Class of buyers and class of sellers with 
procurement sets consisting of single buyer and single seller.
The sellers and buyers are nodes in a graph and the
function F is the distance of two nodes (length of the
edge) which represent transport costs. These costs 
differ between different (buyer, seller) pairs.
• Supply chains [2, 4] (problem B.5). The assumption
of unique manufactory by [2, 4] can best be understood
as turning general supply chains (which need not be
a procurement class domain) into a procurement class
domain.
• Single minded combinatorial auctions [11] (problem B.8).
In this context each seller sells a single good and each
buyer wants a set of goods. The classes are the sets of
sellers selling the same good as well as the buyers who
desire the same bundle. A procurement set consists of
a single buyer as well as a set of sellers who can satisfy
that buyer.
A definition of the mechanism follows:
Definition 3.1. The GTR-1 algorithm - given a 
mechanism M, a set X ⊂ N which is closed under replacement,
a dividing function D, and allocation A, GTR-1 operates as
follows:
1. Use the dividing function D to divide A into 
procurement sets s1, . . . , sk ∈ S.
2. Order the procurement sets by increasing value.
3. For each sj, starting from the lowest value procurement
set:
If for every i ∈ sj ∩ X there is external competition
and every i ∈ sj \ X there is internal competition then
23
keep sj. Otherwise reduce the trade sj (i.e., remove
every i ∈ sj from the allocation).6
4. All trading players are charged the critical value for
trading. All non trading players are charged nothing.
Remark 3.1. The special case where X = N has received
attention under different guises in various special cases, such
as ([13, 3, 4]).
3.1 The GTR-1 Produces an X-external
Mechanism that is IR, IC and BB
In this subsection we prove that the GTR-1 algorithm
produces an X-external mechanism that is IR, IC and BB.
To prove GTR-1"s properties we make use of theorem 3.1
which is a well known result (e.g., [14, 11]). Theorem 3.1
characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions for a 
mechanism for single value players to be IR and IC:
Definition 3.2. An allocation rule R is Bid Monotonic
if for any player i, any bids of the other players b−i ∈ V−i,
and any two possible bids of i, ˆbi > bi, if i trades under the
allocation rule R when reporting bi, then i also trades when
reporting ˆbi.
Intuitively, a bid monotonic allocation rule ensures that
no trading player can become a non-trading player by 
improving his bid.
Theorem 3.1. An IR mechanism M with allocation rule
R is IC if and only if R is Bid Monotonic and each trading
player i pays his critical value Ci (pi = Ci).
So for normalized IR7
and IC mechanisms, the allocation
rule which is bid monotonic uniquely defines the critical 
values for all the players and thus the payments.
Observation 3.1. Let M1 and M2 be two IR and IC
mechanisms with the same allocation rule. Then M1 and
M2 must have the same payment rule.
In the following we prove that the X-external GTR-1 
algorithm produces a IR, IC and BB mechanism, but first a
subsidiary lemma is shown.
Lemma 3.1. For procurement class domains if there 
exists a procurement set sj s.t. i ∈ sj and i has external
competition than all t = i t ∈ sj, t has internal competition.
Proof. This follows from the definition of procurement
class domains. Suppose that i has external competition,
then there exists a set of players Ei(A, s) such that {i} ∪
Ei(A, s) ∈ S. Let us denote by sj = {i} ∪ Ei(A, s). Since
the domain is a procurement-class domain there exists a 
bijection function f between sj and sj. f defines the required
internal competition.
We start by proving IR and IC:

Although the definition of an X-external mechanism 
requires that X intersects every procurement set, this is not
strictly necessary. It is possible to define an X that does
not intersect every possible procurement set. In this case,
any procurement set s ∈ S s.t. s ∩ X = ∅ will be reduced.
7
Note that this is not true for mechanisms which are not
normalized e.g., [7, 12]
Lemma 3.2. For any X, the X-external mechanism with
a critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-1 
algorithm is an IR and IC mechanism.
Proof. By the definition of a critical value pricing scheme
2.2 and the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1 it follows that for every
trading player i, vi ≥ 0. By the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1 
nontrading players i have a payment of zero. Thus for every
player i, value vi, and any b−i ∈ V−i ui(vi, b−i) ≥ 0, 
meaning the produced X-external mechanism is IR.
As the X-external GTR-1 algorithm is IR and applies
the critical value payment scheme according to theorem 3.1,
in order to show that the produced X-external mechanism
with the critical value payment scheme is IC, it remains to
show that the produced mechanism"s allocation rule is bid
monotonic.
Since GTR-1 orders the procurement sets according to 
increasing value, if player i increases his bid from bi to bi > bi
then for any division function D of procurement sets, the
procurement set s containing i always appears later with
the bid bi than with the bid bi. So the likelihood of 
competition can only increase if i appears in later procurement
sets. This follows as GTR-1 can reduce more of the lower
value procurement sets which will result in more non-trading
players.
Therefore if s has the required competition and is not
reduced with bi then it will have the required competition
with bi and will not be reduced.
Finally we prove BB:
Lemma 3.3. For any X, the X-external mechanism with
critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-1 
algorithm is a BB mechanism.
Proof. In order to show that the produced mechanism is
BB we show that each procurement set that is not reduced
has a positive budget (i.e., the sum of payments is positive).
Let s ∈ S be a procurement set that is not reduced. Let
i ∈ s ∩ X then according to the definition of X-external
definition 2.7 and the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1 i has an external
competition. Assume w.l.o.g.8
that i is the only player with
external competition in s and all other players j = i, j ∈ s
have internal competition.
Let A be the allocation after the procurement sets 
reduction by the GTR-1 algorithm. According to the definition of
external competition 2.5, there exists a set Ei(A, s) ⊂ N \A
such that i ∪ Ei(A, s) ∈ S and W(i ∪ Ei(A, s)) ≥ 0. Since
W(i∪Ei(A, s)) = vi +W(Ei(A, s)) then vi ≥ −W(Ei(A, s)).
By the critical value pricing scheme definition 2.2 it means
that if player i bids any less than −W(Ei(A, s)) he will
not have external competition and therefore will be removed
from trading. Thus i pays no less than min −W(Ei(A, s)).
Since all other players j ∈ s have internal competition their
critical price can not be less than their maximal value 
internal competitor (set) i.e., max W(Rj(A, s)). If any player
j ∈ s bids less then its maximal internal competitor (set)
then he will not be in s but his maximal internal competitor
(set) will.
As a possible Ei(A, s) is ∪j∈sRj(A, s) one can bound the
maximal value of i"s external competition W(Ei(A, s)) by
the sum of the maximal values of the rest of the players in s
8
since the domain is a procurement class domain we can use
lemma 3.1
24
internal competition i.e., j∈s max W(Rj(A, s)). Therefore
min −W(Ei(A, s)) = −( j∈s max W(Rj(A, s))). As the F
function is defined to be a positive constant we get that
W(s) = min −W(Ei(A, s))+( j∈s max W(Rj(A, s)))+F(s) ≥
0 and thus s is at least budget balanced. As each 
procurement set that is not reduced is at least budget balanced, it
follows that the produced X-external mechanism is BB.
The above two lemmas yield the following theorem:
Theorem 3.2. For procurement class domains for any
X, the X-external mechanism with critical value pricing
scheme produced by the GTR-1 algorithm is an IR, IC and
BB mechanism.
Remark 3.2. The proof of the theorem yields bounds on
the payments any player has to make to the mechanism.
