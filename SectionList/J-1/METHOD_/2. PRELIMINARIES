2.1 The Model
In this paper we design a method which given any IR
and IC mechanism outputs a mechanism that maintains the
IC and IR properties while achieving BB. For some classes
of mechanisms we bound the competitive approximation of
welfare.
In our model there are N players divided into sets of trade.
The sets of trade are called procurement sets and are defined
(following [2]) as follows:
Definition 2.1. A procurement set s is the smallest set
of players that is required for trade to occur.
For example, in a double-sided auction, a procurement set
is a pair consisting of a buyer and a seller. In a 
combinatorial double-sided auction a procurement set can consist of a
buyer and several sellers. We mark the set of all 
procurement sets as S and assume that any allocation is a disjoint
union of procurement sets.
Each player i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, assigns a real value vi(s) to
each possible procurement set s ∈ S. Namely, vi(s) is the
valuation of player i on procurement set s. We assume that
for each player i vi(s) is i"s private value and that i is a single
value player, meaning that if vi(sj) > 0 then for every other
sk, k = j, either vi(sk) = vi(sj) or vi(sk) = 0. For the
ease of notation we will mark by vi the value of player i
for any procurement set s such that vi(s) > 0. The set
Vi ⊆ R is the set of all possible valuations vi. The set
of all possible valuations of all the players is denoted by
V = V1 × ... × Vn. Let v−i = (v1, ..., vi−1, vi+1, ..., vn) be the
vector of valuations of all the players besides player i, and
let V−i be the set of all possible vectors v−i.
We denote by W(s) the value of a procurement set s ∈
S such that W(s) = i∈s vi(s) + F(s), where F is some
function that assigns a constant to procurement sets. For
example, F can be a (non-strategic) transportation cost in
a distributed market problem. Let the size of a procurement
set s be denoted as |s|.
It is assumed that any allocation is a disjoint union of
procurement sets and therefore one can say that an 
allocation partitions the players into two sets; a set of players that
trade and a set of players that do not trade.
The paper denotes by O the set of possible partitions of an
allocation A into procurement sets. The value W(A) of an
allocation A is the sum of the values of its most efficient 
partition to procurement sets, that is W(A) = maxS∈O s∈S W(s).
This means that W(A) = i∈A vi +maxS∈O s∈S F(s). In
the case where F is identically zero, then W(A) = i∈A vi.
An optimal partition S∗
(A) is a partition that maximizes
the above sum for an allocation A. Let the value of A be
W(S∗
(A)) (note that the value can depend on F). We say
that the allocation A is efficient if there is no other allocation
with a higher value. The efficiency of the allocation ˆA is
W ( ˆA)
W (A)
, where A is a maximal valued allocation. We assume
w.l.o.g. that there are no two allocations with the same
value3
.
A mechanism M defines an allocation and payment rules,
M = (R, P). A payment rule P decides i"s payment pi where
P is a function P : V → RN
. We work with mechanisms
3
Ties can be broken using the identities of the players.
21
in which players are required to report their values. An
example of such a mechanism is the VCG mechanism [17,
8, 10]. The reported value bi ∈ Vi of player i is called a
bid and might be different from his private value vi. Let
b ∈ V be the bids of all players. An allocation rule R decides
the allocation according to the reported values b ∈ V . We
make the standard assumption that players have quasi-linear
utility so that when player i trades and pays pi then his
utility is ui(vi, b−i) = vi − pi, ui : V ⇒ R. We also assume
that players are rational utility maximizers.
Mechanism M is Budget Balanced (BB) if i∈N pi ≥ 0
for any bids b ∈ V . M is Incentive-Compatible (IC) in 
dominant strategies if for any player i, value vi and any b−i ∈ V−i,
ui(vi, b−i) ≥ ui(b) meaning that for any player i, bidding vi
maximized i"s utility over all possible bids of the other 
players. M is (ex-post) Individually Rational (IR) if for any
player i value vi, and any b−i ∈ V−i ui(vi, b−i) ≥ 0 
meaning that for all possible bids of the other players, player"s i
utility is non-negative. Note that since our mechanisms are
normalized IR, if a player does not trade then the player
pays 0 and has utility 0.
Our algorithm presented in the next section employs a
commonly used payment scheme, the critical value payment
scheme.
Definition 2.2. Critical value payment scheme: A 
mechanism uses a critical value payment scheme if given an 
allocation it charges players the minimum value they need to
report to the mechanism in order to remain allocated.
We denote by Ci the critical value price computed for player
i.
2.2 Competitions and Domains
In this paper we present two generalized trade reduction
algorithms. The two algorithms are such that given an IR
and IC mechanism M that solves a problem in some 
domain (different domains are formally defined below), turns
M into IR, IC and BB mechanism. The algorithm presented
finds procurement sets and removes them in iterations until
the right conditions are fulfilled and the mechanism M is
turned into a BB one. The right conditions that need to
be met are conditions of competition among the players in
the given problem. The following definitions leads us to the
competition conditions we are looking for.
Definition 2.3. For any player i ∈ N, we say that the
set Ri ⊆ N \ {i} is a replacing set of i, if for any 
procurement set s ∈ S such that i ∈ s and Ri∩s = ∅, s\{i}∪Ri ∈ S.
For example, in a (homogeneous) double-sided auction
(see problem B.1) the replacement set for any buyer is simply
any other buyer. In an auction for transportation slots (see
problem B.7), the replacement set of an edge is a path 
between the endpoints of the edge. Note that a set can replace
a single player. Furthermore, this relationship is transitive
but not necessarily symmetric. If i is a replacement set for
j, it is not necessarily true that j is a replacement set for i.
Definition 2.4. For any allocation A, procurement set
s ⊆ A, and any i ∈ s we say Ri(A, s) is an internal 
competition for i with respect to A and s, if Ri(A, s) ⊆ N \ A
is a replacement set for i s.t. T = s \ {i} ∪ Ri(A, s) ∈ S and
W(T) ≥ 0.
Definition 2.5. For any allocation A and procurement
set s ⊆ A and any i ∈ s we say that Ei(A, s) is an external
competition for i with respect to A and s, if Ei(A, s) ⊆
N \ A is a set s.t., T = {i} ∪ Ei(A, s) ∈ S and W(T) ≥ 0.
We will assume, without loss of generality, that there are
no ties between the values of any allocations, and in 
particular there are no ties between values of procurement sets.
In case of ties, these can be broken by using the identities
of the players4
. So for any allocation A, procurement set s
and player i with external competition Ei(A, s), there exists
exactly one set representing the maximally valued external
competition.
Definition 2.6. A set X ⊂ N is closed under 
replacement if ∀i ∈ X then Ri ⊂ X
The following defines the required competition needed to
maintain IC, IR and BB. The set X5
denotes this 
competition and is closed under replacement. In the remainder of
the paper we will assume that all of our sets which define
competition in a mechanism are closed under replacement.
Definition 2.7. Let X ⊂ N be a set that is closed under
replacement, we say that the mechanism is an X-external
mechanism, if
1. Each player i ∈ X has an external competition.
2. Each player i /∈ X has an internal competition.
3. For all players i1, . . . , it ∈ s \ X there exist
Ri1 (A, s), . . . , Rit (A, s)
such that for every iz = iq, Riz (A, s) ∩ Riq (A, s) = ∅
4. for every procurement set s ∈ S it holds that s∩X = ∅
For general domains the choice of X can be crucial. In
fact even for the same domain the welfare (and revenue) can
vary widely depending on how X is defined. In appendix C
we give an example where two possible choices of X yield
greatly different results. Although we show that X should
be chosen as small as possible we do not give any 
characterization of the optimality of X and this is an important open
problem.
Our two generalized trade reduction algorithms will 
ensure that for any allocation we have the desired types of
competition. So given a mechanism M that is IC and IR
with allocation A, the goal of the algorithms is to turn M
into an X-external mechanism. The two generalized trade
reduction algorithms utilize a dividing function D which 
divides allocation A into disjoint procurement sets. The 
algorithms order the procurements sets defined by D in order
of increasing value. For any procurement set there is a 
desired type of competition that depends only on the players
who compose the procurement set. The generalized trade
reduction algorithms go over the procurement sets in order
(from the smallest to the largest) and remove any 
procurement set that does not have the desired competition when
the set is reached. The reduction of procurement sets will
also be referred to as a trade reduction.
Formally,

The details of how to break ties in allocations are standard
and are omitted.

We present some tradeoffs between the different possible
sets in Appendix C.

Definition 2.8. D is a dividing function if for any 
allocation A and the players" value vector v, D divides the 
allocation into disjoint procurements sets s1, . . . , sk s.t. ∪sj =
A and for any player i with value vi if i ∈ sj1 and t ∈ sj2 s.t.
j1 ≥ j2 then for any value vi > vi of player i and division by
D into s1, . . . , sk such that i ∈ sj1
and t ∈ sj2
then j1 > j2.
The two generalized trade reduction algorithms presented
accept problems in different domains. The formal domain
definitions follow:
Definition 2.9. A domain is a class domain if for all
i ∈ N and all replacement sets of i, Ri, |Ri| = 1 and for all
i, j, i = j if j = Ri then i = Rj.
Intuitively, this means that replacement sets are of size 1
and the replacing relationship is symmetric.
We define the class of a player i as the set of the player"s
replacement sets and denote the class of player i by [i]. It is
important to note that since replacement sets are transitive
relations and since class domains also impose symmetric 
relations on the replacement sets, the class of a player i, [i] is
actually an equivalence class for i.
Definition 2.10. A domain is a procurement-class 
domain if the domain is a class-based domain and if for any
player i such that there exists two procurement sets s1, s2
(not necessarily trading simultaneously in any allocation)
such that i ∈ s1 and i ∈ s2 then there exists a bijection
f : s1 → s2 such that for any j ∈ s1, f(j) is a replacement
set for j in s2.
Example 2.1. A (homogeneous) double-sided auction (see
problem B.1) is a procurement-class based domain. For the
(homogeneous) double-sided auction each procurement set
consists of a buyer and a seller.
The double sided combinatorial auction consisting of a 
single multi-minded buyer and multiple sellers of heterogenous
goods (see problem B.9), is a class based domain (as we have
a single buyer) but not a procurement-class based domain.
In this case, the buyer is a class and each set of sellers of
the same good is a class. However, for a buyer there is no
bijection between the different the procurement sets of the
bundles of goods the buyer is interested in.
The spatial-distributed market with strategic edges (see
problem B.6) is not a class-based domain (and therefore not
a procurement-class domain). For example, even for a fixed
buyer and a fixed seller there are two different procurement
sets consisting of different paths between the buyers and 
sellers.
The next sections present two algorithms GTR-1 and 
GTR2. GTR-1 accepts problems in procurement-class based 
domains, its properties are proved with a general dividing 
function D. The GTR-2 algorithm accepts problems in any 
domain. We prove the GTR-2"s properties with specific 
dividing function D0. The function will be defined in section
4. Since the dividing function can have a large practical
impact on welfare (and revenue) the generality of GTR − 1
(albeit in special domains) can be an important practical
consideration.
