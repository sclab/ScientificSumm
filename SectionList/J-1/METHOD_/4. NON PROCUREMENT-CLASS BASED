DOMAINS
The main reason that GTR-1 works for the 
procurementclass domains is that each player"s possibility of being 
reduced is monotonic. By the definition of a dividing function
if a player i ∈ sj increases his value, i can only appear in
later procurement set sj and hence has a higher chance of
having the desired competition.
Therefore, the chance of i lacking the requisite 
competition is decreased. Since the domain is a procurement class
domain, all other players t = i,t ∈ sj are also more likely
to have competition since members of their class continue
to appear before i and hence the likelihood that i will be
reduced is decreased. Since by theorem 3.1 a necessary and
sufficient condition for the mechanism to be IC is 
monotonicity. GTR-1 is IC for procurement-class domains.
However, for domains that are not procurement class 
domains this does not suffice even if the domain is a class based
domain. Although, all members of sj continue to have the
required competition it is possible that there are members of
sj who do not have analogues in sj who do not have 
competition. Hence i might be reduced after increasing his value
which by lemma 3.1 means the mechanism is not IC.
We therefore define a different algorithm for non 
procurement class domains.
Our modified algorithm requires a special dividing 
function in order to maintain the IC property. Although our
restriction to this special dividing function appears 
stringent, the dividing function we use is a generalization of the
way that procurement sets are chosen in procurement-class
based domains e.g., [13, 16, 9, 3, 2, 4].
For ease of presentation in this section we assume that
F = 0.
The dividing function for general domains is defined by
looking at all possible dividing functions. For each 
dividing function Di and each set of bids, the GTR-1 algorithm
yields a welfare that is a function of the bids and the 
dividing function9
. We denote by D0 the dividing function that
divides the players into sets s.t. the welfare that GTR-1
finds is maximal10
.
9
Note that for any particular Di this might not be IC as
GTR-1 is IC only for procurement class domains and not
for general domains
10
In Appendix A we show how to calculate D0 in 
polynoFormally,
Let D be the set of all dividing functions D. Denote
the welfare achieved by the mechanism produced by 
GTR1 when using dividing function D and a set of bids ¯b by
GTR1(D,¯b). Denote by D0(¯b) = argmaxD∈D(GTR1(D,¯b)).
For ease of presentation we denote D0(¯b) by D0 when the
dependence on b is clear from the context.
Remark 4.1. D0 is an element of the set of dividing 
functions, and therefore is a dividing function.
The second generalized trade reduction algorithm GTR-2
follows.
Definition 4.1. The GTR-2 algorithm - Given 
mechanism M, allocation A, and a set X ⊂ N closed under 
replacement, GTR-2 operates as follows:
1. Calculate the dividing function D0 as defined above.
2. Use the dividing function D0 to divide A into 
procurement sets s1, . . . , sk ∈ S.
3. For each sj, starting from the lowest value 
procurement set, do the following:
If for i ∈ sj ∩ X there is an external competition and
there is at most one i ∈ sj that does not have an 
internal competition then keep sj. Otherwise, reduce the
trade sj.
4. All trading players are charged the critical value for
trading. All non trading players are charged zero.
11
We will prove that the mechanism produced by GTR-2
maintains the desired properties of IR, IC, and BB. The 
following lemma shows that the GTR-2 produced mechanism
is IR, and IC.
Lemma 4.1. For any X, the X-external mechanism with
critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-2 
algorithm is an IR and IC mechanism.
Proof. By theorem 3.1 it suffices to prove that the 
produced mechanism by the GTR-2 algorithm is bid monotonic
for every player i. Suppose that i was not reduced when 
bidding bi we need to prove that i will not be reduced when 
bidding bi > bi. Denote by D1 = D0(b) the dividing function
used by GTR-2 when i reported bi and the rest of the 
players reported b−i. Denote by D1 = D0(bi, b−i) the dividing
function used by GTR-2 when i reported bi and the rest of
the players reported b−i. Denote by ¯D1(b) a maximal 
dividing function that results in GTR-1 reducing i when 
reporting bi. Assume to the contrary that GTR-2 reduced i from
the trade when i reported bi then GTR1(D1, (bi, b−i)) =
GTR1( ¯D1, b). Since D1 ∈ D it follows that GTR1(D1, b) >
GTR1( ¯D1, b) and therefore
GTR1(D1, b) > GTR1(D1, (bi, b−i)). However according to
the definition D1 ∈ D, GTR-2 should not have reduced i
mial time for procurement-class domains. Calculating D0 in
polynomial time for general domains is an important open
problem.
11
In the full version GTR-2 is extend such that it suffices
that there exists some time in which the third step holds.
That extension is omitted from current version due to lack
of space.
25
with the dividing function D1 and gained a greater welfare
than GTR1(D1, b). Thus a contradiction arises and and
GTR-2 does not reduce i from the trade when i reports
bi > bi.
Lemma 4.2. For any X, the X-external mechanism with
critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-2 
algorithm is a BB mechanism.
Proof. This proof is similar to the proof of lemma 3.3.
Combining the two lemmas above we get:
Theorem 4.1. For any X closed under replacement, the
X-external mechanism with critical value pricing scheme
produced by the GTR-2 algorithm is an IR, IC and BB 
mechanism.
Appendix A shows how to calculate D0 for procurement
class domains in polynomial time, it is not generally known
how to easily calculate D0. Creating a general method for
calculating the needed dividing function in polynomial time
remains as an open question.
4.1 Bounding the Welfare for 
ProcurementClass Based Domains and other General
Domains Cases
This section shows that in addition to producing a 
mechanism with the desired properties, GTR-2 also produces a
mechanism that maintains high welfare. Since the GTR-2
algorithm finds a budget balanced mechanism in arbitrary
domains we are unable to bound the welfare for general
cases. However we can bound the welfare for 
procurementclass based domain and a wide variety of cases in general
domains which includes many cases previously studied.
Definition 4.2. Denote freqk([i], sj) to indicate that a
class [i] appears in a procurement set sj, k times and there
are k members of [i] in sj.
Definition 4.3. Denote by freqk([i], S) the maximal k
s.t. there are k members of [i] in sj. I.e., freqk([i], S) =
maxsj ∈S freqk([i], sj).
Let the set of equivalence classes in procurement class
based domain mechanism be ec and |ec| be the number of
those equivalence classes.
Using the definition of class appearance frequency we can
bound the welfare achieved by the GTR-2 produced 
mechanism for procurement class domains12
:
Lemma 4.3. For procurement class domains with F = 0,
the number of procurement sets that are reduced by GTR-213
is at most |ec| times the maximal frequency of each class.
Formally, the maximal number of procurement sets that is
reduced is O( [i]∈ec
freqk([i], S))
Proof. Let D be an arbitrary dividing function. We
note that by definition any procurement set sj will not be
reduced if every i ∈ sj has both internal competition and
external competition.
12
The welfare achieved by GTR-1 can also be bounded for
the cases presented in this section. However, we focus on
GTR-2 as it always achieves better welfare.
13
or GTR-1
Every procurement set s that is reduced has at least one
player i who has no competition. Once s is reduced all
players of [i] have internal competition. So by reducing the
number of equivalence classes |ec| procurement sets we cover
all the remaining players with internal competition.
If the maximal frequency of every equivalence classes was
one then each remaining player t in procurement set sk also
have external competition as all the internal competitors of
players ¯t = t, ¯t ∈ sk are an external competition for t.
If we have freqk([t], S) players from class [t] who were
reduced then there is sufficient external competition for all
players in sk.
Therefore it suffices to reduce O( [i]∈ec
freqk([i], S)) 
procurement sets in order to ensure that both the requisite 
internal and external competition exists.
The next theorem follows as an immediate corollary for
lemma 4.3:
Theorem 4.2. Given procurement-class based domain 
mechanisms with H procurement sets, the efficiency is at least a
1 − O(
O( [i]∈ec
freqk([i],S))
H
) fraction of the optimal welfare.
The following corollaries are direct results of theorem 4.2.
All of these corollaries either improve prior results or achieve
the same welfare as prior results.
Corollary 4.1. Using GTR-2 for homogenous 
doublesided auctions (problem B.1) at most14
one procurement set
must be reduced.
Similarly, for spatially distributed markets without 
strategic edges (problem B.3) using GTR-2 improves the result of
[3] where a minimum cycle including a buyer and seller is
reduced.
Corollary 4.2. Using GTR-2 for spatially distributed
markets without strategic edges at most one cycle per 
connected component15
will be reduced.
For supply chains (problem B.5) using GTR-2 improves
the result of [2, 4] similar to corollary 4.2.
Corollary 4.3. Using GTR-2 for supply chains at most
one cycle per connected component16
will be reduced.
The following corollary solves the open problem at [3].
Corollary 4.4. For distributed markets on n nodes with
strategic agents and paths of bounded length K (problem B.6)
it suffices to remove at most K ∗ n procurements sets.
Proof. Sketch: These will create at least K spanning
trees, hence we can disjointly cover every remaining 
procurement set. This improves the naive algorithm of reducing n2
procurement sets.
We provide results for two special cases of double sided
CA with single value players (problem B.8).
14
It is possible that no reductions will be made, for instance
when there is a non-trading player who is the requisite 
external competition.
15
Similar to the double-sided auctions, sometimes there will
be enough competition without a reduction.
16
Similar to double-sided auctions, sometimes there will be
enough competition without a reduction.
26
Corollary 4.5. if there are at most M different kinds of
procurement sets it suffices to remove M procurement sets.
Corollary 4.6. If there are K types of goods and each
procurement set consists of at most one of each type it 
suffices to remove at most K procurement sets.
