In this paper we presented a general solution procedure
called the Generalized Trade Reduction (GTR). GTR 
accepts an IR and IC mechanism as an input and outputs
mechanisms that are IR, IC and BB. The output 
mechanisms achieves welfare that is close to optimal for a wide
range of domains.
The GTR procedure improves on existing results such
as homogeneous double-sided auctions, distributed markets,
and supply chains, and solves several open problems such as
distributed markets with strategic transportation edges and
bounded paths, combinatorial double-sided auctions with
bounded size procurements sets, and combinatorial 
doublesided auctions with a bounded number of procurement sets.
The question of the quality of welfare approximation both
in general and in class domains that are not procurement
class domains is an important and interesting open 
question. We also leave open the question of upper bounds for
the quality of approximation of welfare. Although we know
that it is impossible to have IR, IC and BB in an efficient
mechanism it would be interesting to have an upper bound
on the approximation to welfare achievable in an IR, IC and
BB mechanism.
The GTR procedure outputs a mechanism which depends
on a set X âŠ‚ N. Another interesting question is what the
quality of approximation is when X is chosen randomly from
N before valuations are declared.
