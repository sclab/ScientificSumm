When designing a mechanism there are several key 
properties that are desirable to maintain. Some of the more
important ones are individual rationality (IR) - to make it
worthwhile for all players to participate, incentive 
compatibility (IC) - to give incentive to players to report their true
value to the mechanism and budget balance (BB) - not to
run the mechanism on a loss. In many of the mechanisms
the goal function that a mechanism designer attempts to
maximize is the social welfare1
- the total benefit to society.
However, it is well known from [15] that any mechanism that
maximizes social welfare while maintaining individual 
rationality and incentive compatibility runs a deficit perforce,
i.e., is not budget balanced.
Of course, for many applications of practical importance
we lack the will and the capability to allow the mechanism
to run a deficit and hence one must balance the payments
made by the mechanism. To maintain the BB property in
an IR and IC mechanism it is necessary to compromise on
the optimality of the social welfare.
1.1 Related Work and Specific Solutions
There have been several attempts to design budget 
balanced mechanisms for particular domains2
. For instance,
for double-sided auctions where both the buyers and sellers
are strategic and the goods are homogeneous [13] (or when
the goods are heterogeneous [5]). [13] developed a 
mechanism that given valuations of buyers and sellers produces an
allocation (which are the trading players) and a matching
between buyers and sellers such that the mechanism is IR,
IC, and BB while retaining most of the social welfare. In the
distributed markets problem (and closely related problems)
goods are transported between geographic locations while
incurring some constant cost for transportation. [16, 9,
3] present mechanisms that approximate the social welfare
while achieving an IR, IC and BB mechanism. For supply
chain problems [2, 4] bounds the loss of social welfare that
is necessary to inflict on the mechanism in order to achieve
the desired combination of IR, IC, and BB.
Despite the works discussed above, the question of how to
design a general mechanism that achieves IR, IC, and BB
independently of the problem domain remains open. 
Furthermore, there are several domains where the question of
how to design an IR, IC and BB mechanism which 
approx1
Social Welfare is also referred to as efficiency in the 
economics literature.

imates the social welfare remains an open problem. For
example, in the important domain of combinatorial 
doublesided auctions there is no known result that bounds the loss
of social welfare needed to achieve budget balance. Another
interesting example is the open question left by [3]:How can
one bound the loss in social welfare that is needed to achieve
budget balance in an IR and IC distributed market where
the transportation edges are strategic. Naturally an answer
to the BB distributed market with strategic edges has vast
practical implications, for example to transportation 
networks.
1.2 Our Contribution
In this paper we unify all the problems discussed above
(both the solved as well as the open ones) into one solution
concept procedure. The solution procedure called the 
Generalized Trade Reduction (GTR). GTR accepts an IR and
IC mechanism for single-valued players and outputs an IR,
IC and BB mechanism. The output mechanism may suffer
some welfare loss as a tradeoff of achieving BB. There are
problem instances in which no welfare loss is necessary but
by [15] there are problem instances in which there is welfare
loss. Nevertheless for a wide class of problems we are able to
bound the loss in welfare. A particularly interesting case is
one in which the input mechanism is an efficient allocation.
In addition to unifying many of the BB problems under
a single solution concept, the GTR procedure improves on
existing results and solves several open problems in the 
literature. The existing solutions our GTR procedure improves
are homogeneous double-sided auctions, distributed markets
[3], and supply chain [2, 4]. For the homogeneous 
doublesided auctions the GTR solution procedure improves on the
well known solution [13] by allowing for some cases of no
trade reduction at all. For the distributed markets [3] and
the supply chain [2, 4] the GTR solution procedure improves
on the welfare losses" bound, i.e., allows one to achieve an
IR, IC and BB mechanism with smaller loss on the social
welfare. Recently we also learned that the GTR procedure
allows one to turn the model newly presented [6] into a
BB mechanism. The open problems that are answered by
GTR are distributed markets with strategic transportation
edges and bounded paths, combinatorial double-sided 
auctions with bounded size of the trading group i.e., a buyer and
its bundle goods" sellers, combinatorial double-sided 
auctions with bounded number of possible trading groups.
In addition to the main contribution described above, this
paper also defines an important classification of problem 
domains. We define class based domain and procurement class
based domains. The above definitions build on the 
different competition powers of players in a mechanisms called
internal and external competition. Most of the studied 
problem domains are of the more restrictive procurement class
domains and we believe that the more general setting will
inspire more research.
