Traditional IR approaches usually consider the query as the only
element available for the user information need. Many previous
studies have investigated the integration of some contextual
factors in IR models, typically by incorporating a user profile. In
this paper, we argue that a single user profile (or model) can
contain a too large variety of different topics so that new queries
can be incorrectly biased. Similarly to some previous studies, we
propose to model topic domains instead of the user.
Previous investigations on context focused on factors around the
query. We showed in this paper that factors within the query are
also important - they help select the appropriate term relations to
apply in query expansion.
We have integrated the above contextual factors, together with
feedback model, in a single language model. Our experimental
results strongly confirm the benefit of using contexts in IR. This
work also shows that the language modeling framework is
appropriate for integrating many contextual factors.
This work can be further improved on several aspects, including
other methods to extract term relations, to integrate more context
words in conditions and to identify query domains. It would also
be interesting to test the method on Web search using user search
history. We will investigate these problems in our future research.
