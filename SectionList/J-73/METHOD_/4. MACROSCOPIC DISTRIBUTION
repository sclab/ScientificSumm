MODELS
We conclude our results with a return to the price-volume
model, where we shall introduce some refined methods of
analysis for online trading algorithms. We leave the 
generalization of these methods to the order book model for
future work.
The competitive ratios defined so far measure performance
relative to some baseline criterion in the worst case over all
market sequences S ∈ Σ. It has been observed in many
online settings that such worst-case metrics can yield 
pessimistic results, and various relaxations have been 
considered, such as permitting a probability distribution over the
input sequence.
We now consider distributional models that are 
considerably weaker than assuming a distribution over complete
market sequences S ∈ Σ. In the volume distribution model,
we assume only that there exists a distribution Pvol over the
total volume V traded in the market for the day, and then 
examine the worst-case competitive ratio over sequences 
consistent with the randomly chosen volume. More precisely,
we define
RVWAP(A, Pvol ) = EV ∼Pvol max
S∈seq(V )
VWAPM (S)
VWAPA(S)
.
Here V ∼ Pvol denotes that V is chosen with respect to
distribution Pvol , and seq(V ) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market
sequences (p1, v1), . . . , (pT , vT ) satisfying T
t=1 vt = V .
Similarly, for OWT, we can define
ROWT(A, Pmaxprice ) = Ep∼Pmaxprice max
S∈seq(p)
p
VWAPA(S)
.
Here Pmaxprice is a distribution over just the maximum price
of the day, and we then examine worst-case sequences 
consistent with this price (seq(p) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market
sequences satisfying max1≤t≤T pt = p). Analogous buy-side
definitions can be given.
We emphasize that in these models, only the distribution
of maximum volume and price is known to the algorithm.
We also note that our probabilistic assumptions on S are
considerably weaker than typical statistical finance 
models, which would posit a detailed stochastic model for the
step-by-step evolution of (pt, vt). Here we instead permit
only a distribution over crude, macroscopic measures of the
entire day"s market activity, such as the total volume and
high price, and analyze the worst-case performance 
consistent with these crude measures. For this reason, we refer to
such settings as the macroscopic distribution model.
The work of El-Yaniv et al. [3] examines distributional
assumptions similar to ours, but they emphasize the 
worst196
case choices for the distributions as well, and show that this
leads to results no better than the original worst-case 
analysis over all sequences. In contrast, we feel that the analysis
of specific distributions Pvol and Pmaxprice is natural in many
financial contexts and our preliminary experimental results
show significant improvements when this rather crude 
distributional information is taken into account (see Figure 3).
Our results in the VWAP setting examine the cases where
these distributions are known exactly or only approximately.
Similar results can be obtained for macroscopic distributions
of maximum daily price for the one-way trading setting.
4.1 Results in the Macroscopic Distribution
Model
We begin by noting that the algorithms examined so far
work by binning total volumes or maximum prices into bins
of exponentially increasing size, and then guessing the
index of the bin in which the actual quantity falls. It is
thus natural that the macroscopic distribution model 
performance of such algorithms (which are common in 
competitive analysis) might depend on the distribution of the true
bin index.
In the remaining, we assume that Q is a power of 2 and
the base of the logarithm is 2. Let Pvol denote the 
distribution of total daily market volume. We define the 
related distribution Pbins
vol over bin indices i as follows: for
all i = 1, . . . , log(Q) − 1, Pbins
vol (i) is equal to the 
probability, under Pvol , that the daily volume falls in the interval
[Vmin 2i−1
, Vmin 2i
), and Pbins
vol (log(Q)) is for the last interval
[Vmax /2, Vmax ] .
We define E as
E(Pbins
vol ) ≡ Ei∼P bins
vol
1/Pbins
vol (i)
2
=


log(Q)
i=1
Pbins
vol (i)


2
.
Since the support of Pbins
vol has only log(Q) elements, E(Pbins
vol )
can vary from 1 (for distributions Pvol that place all of
their weight in only one of the log(Q) intervals between
Vmin , Vmin 2, Vmin 4, . . . , Vmax ) to log(Q) (for distributions
Pvol in which the total daily volume is equally likely to fall
in any one of these intervals). Note that distributions Pvol
of this latter type are far from uniform over the entire range
[Vmin , Vmax ].
Theorem 10. In the volume distribution model under the
volume variability assumption, there exists an online 
algorithm A for selling N shares that, using only knowledge of
the total volume distribution Pvol , achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤
2E(Pbins
vol ).
All proofs in this section are provided in the appendix.
As a concrete example, consider the case in which Pvol
is the uniform distribution over [Vmin , Vmax ]. In that case,
Pbins
vol is exponentially increasing and peaks at the last bin,
which, having the largest width, also has the largest weight.
In this case E(Pbins
vol ) is a constant (i.e., independent of Q),
leading to a constant competitive ratio. On the other hand,
if Pvol is exponential, then Pbins
vol is uniform, leading to an
O(log(Q)) competitive ratio, just as in the more adversarial
price-volume setting discussed earlier. In Figure 3, we 
provide additional specific bounds obtained for empirical total
daily volume distributions computed for some real stocks.
We now examine the setting in which Pvol is unknown,
but an approximation ˜Pvol is available. Let us define
C(Pbins
vol , ˜Pbins
vol ) = log(Q)
j=1
˜Pbins
vol (j) log(Q)
i=1
P bins
vol (i)
√ ˜P bins
vol
(i)
.
C is minimized at C(Pbins
vol , Pbins
vol ) = E(Pbins
vol ), and C may
be infinite if ˜Pbins
vol (i) is 0 when Pbins
vol (i) > 0.
Theorem 11. In the volume distribution model under the
volume variability assumption, there exists an online 
algorithm A for selling N shares that using only knowledge of
an approximation ˜Pvol of Pvol achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤
2C(Pbins
vol , ˜Pbins
vol ).
As an example of this result, suppose our approximation
obeys (1/α)Pbins
vol (i) ≤ ˜Pbins
vol (i) ≤ αPbins
vol (i) for all i, for
some α > 1. Thus our estimated bin index probabilities
are all within a factor of α of the truth. Then it is easy
to show that C(Pbins
vol , ˜Pbins
vol ) ≤ αE(Pbins
vol ), so according to
Theorems 10 and 11 our penalty for using the approximate
distribution is a factor of α in competitive ratio.
