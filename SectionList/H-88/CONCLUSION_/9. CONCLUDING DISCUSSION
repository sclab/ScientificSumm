When generating retrieval results over an XML collection,
some overlap in the results should be tolerated, and may be
beneficial. For example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly
specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element,
both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms
and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship. The
algorithm presented in this paper controls overlap by 
weighting the terms occurring in reported elements to reflect their
reduced importance.
Other approaches may also help to control overlap. For
example, when XML retrieval results are presented to users
it may be desirable to cluster structurally related elements
together, visually illustrating the relationships between them.
While this style of user interface may help a user cope with
overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be
applicable, by determining the best elements to include in
each cluster.
At Waterloo, we continue to develop and test our ideas
for INEX 2005. In particular, we are investigating methods
for learning the α and βj weights. We are also re-evaluating
our approach to document statistics and examining 
appropriate adjustments to the k1 parameter as term weights
change [20].
