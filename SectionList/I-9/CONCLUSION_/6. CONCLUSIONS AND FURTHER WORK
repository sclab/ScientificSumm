This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.
In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource,
capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight 
integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.
Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform
the desired interactions.
In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications
to capture the meaning of interactive actions via 
commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of
agents about resources, commitments and about time as well
as updating processes. The proof construction mechanism
130 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
provides agents with the ability to dynamically select 
appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the
flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most
suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into
consideration on-going changes in the environment.
Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the
commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents" 
interactive actions. Approaches based on commitment 
machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues. These
approaches use logic systems that are limited in their 
expressiveness to model resources. Also, as an extra abstract
layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created 
accordingly. In particular, there must be a human-designed
mapping between protocol actions and operations on 
commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and
phases of commitment achievement. Moreover, external 
mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle 
operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement
of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type 
representations. This requires another execution in the 
commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of
the protocol. Not only these extra tasks create an overhead
but also makes the specification and execution of protocols
more error prone.
Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of 
linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction
techniques to help agents to figure out the missing 
capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other
agents about cooperation strategies. Our approach differs
in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of
interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map
for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and
updating using the full propositional TLL. Moreover, we 
emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules
with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the 
advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.
Our further work will include using TLL to verify 
various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and
safety. Also, we will investigate developing an execution
mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.
