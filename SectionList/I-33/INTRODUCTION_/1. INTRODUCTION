The opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of 
organizational and social theory to distributed AI and multiagent 
systems (MASs) has long been advocated ([8]). In MASs the 
application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system
design has proven to be useful for the development of 
methodologies and tools. In many cases, however, the application of these
conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high
level design of the systems. It is our thesis that the application of
those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are
treated formally, that is, once notions such as norm, role, structure,
etc. obtain a formal semantics. This has been the case for agent
programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from
folk psychology (belief, intention, desire, knowledge, etc.) have
been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as,
for instance, BDICTL ([22]) and KARO ([17]). As a matter of
fact, those theories have fostered the production of architectures
and programming languages.
What is lacking at the moment for the design and development of
open MASs is, in our opinion, something that can play the role that
BDI-like formalisms have played for the design and development
of single-agent architectures. Aim of the present paper is to fill this
gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal 
foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its
relation to the organizational one. The main result of the paper 
consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step
by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational
structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap
between abstract norms and concrete system specifications.
Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which
provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm,
role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions
such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and 
implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some
aspects of the design of norm enforcement. In Section 3 the 
framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an
institution. The extended framework is then studied in relation to
the formalism for representing organizational structures presented
in [11]. In Section 4 some conclusions follow.
