The paper aimed at providing a comprehensive formal 
analysis of the institutional metaphor and its relation to the 
organizational one. The predominant formal tool has been description logic.
TBoxes has been used to represent the specifications of 
institutions (Definition 3) and their infrastructures (Definition 6), 
providing therefore a transition system semantics for a number of 
institutional notions (Examples 1-7). Multi-graphs has then been used to
represent the specification of organizational structures (Definition
6). The last result presented concerned the definition of a formal
correspondence between institution and organization specifications
(Definition 7), which provides a formal way for switching between
the two paradigms. All in all, these results deliver a way for relating
abstract system specifications (i.e., institutions as sets of norms) to
specifications that are closer to an implemented system (i.e., 
organizational structures).
