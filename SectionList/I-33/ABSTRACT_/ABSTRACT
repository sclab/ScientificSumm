Up to now, the way institutions and organizations have been used in
the development of open systems has not often gone further than a
useful heuristics. In order to develop systems actually 
implementing institutions and organizations, formal methods should take the
place of heuristic ones. The paper presents a formal semantics for
the notion of institution and its components (abstract and concrete
norms, empowerment of agents, roles) and defines a formal 
relation between institutions and organizational structures. As a result,
it is shown how institutional norms can be refined to 
constructsorganizational structures-which are closer to an implemented 
system. It is also shown how such a refinement process can be fully
formalized and it is therefore amenable to rigorous verification.
