There has been previous work that analyzes which 
strategies are resilient to mutant invasions with respect to various
types of graphs. What sets our work apart is that the model
we consider encompasses a significantly more general class of
games and graph topologies. We will briefly survey this 
literature and point out the differences in the previous models
and ours.
In [8], [3], and [4], the authors consider specific families
of graphs, such as cycles and lattices, where players play
specific games, such as 2 × 2-games or k × k-coordination
games. In these papers the authors specify a simple, local
dynamic for players to improve their payoffs by changing
strategies, and analyze what type of strategies will grow to
dominate the population. The model we propose is more
general than both of these, as it encompasses a larger class
of graphs as well as a richer set of games.
Also related to our work is that of [14], where the authors
propose two models. The first assumes organisms interact
according to a weighted, undirected graph. However, the
fitness of each organism is simply assigned and does not 
depend on the actions of each organism"s neighborhood. The
second model has organisms arranged around a directed 
cycle, where neighbors play a 2 × 2-game. With probability
proportional to its fitness, an organism is chosen to 
reproduce by placing a replica of itself in its neighbors position,
thereby killing the neighbor. We consider more general
games than the first model and more general graphs than
the second.
Finally, the works most closely related to ours are [7], [15],
and [6]. The authors consider 2-action, coordination games
played by players in a general undirected graph. In these
three works, the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to
reproduce, and analyze properties of the graph that allow a
strategy to overrun the population. Here again, one can see
that our model is more general than these, as it allows for
organisms to play any 2-player, symmetric game.
