We now proceed to state and prove two complementary
results in the network ESS model defined in Section 3. First,
we consider a setting where the graphs are generated via the
Gn,p model of Erd˝os and R´enyi [5]. In this model, every
pair of vertices are joined by an edge independently and
with probability p (where p may depend on n). The mutant
set, however, will be constructed adversarially (subject to
the linear size constraint given by Definition 3.3). For these
settings, we show that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s
is a classical ESS of that game, if and only if s is an ESS
for {Gn,p}∞
n=0, where p = Ω(1/nc
) and 0 ≤ c < 1, and any
mutant family {Mn}∞
n=0, where each Mn has linear size. We
note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small
γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ
or larger
- that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and
potentially far smaller than O(n2
). It is easy to convince
oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of
edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may
simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due
to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games.
Thus in some sense we examine the minimum plausible edge
density.
The second result is a kind of dual to the first, considering
a setting where the graphs are chosen arbitrarily (subject to
conditions) but the mutant sets are chosen randomly. It
states that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a 
classical ESS for that game, if and only if s is an ESS for any
{Gn = (Vn, En)}∞
n=0 in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ
)
(for any constant γ > 0), and a family of mutant sets
{Mn}∞
n=0, that is chosen randomly (that is, in which each 
organism is labeled a mutant with constant probability > 0).
Thus, in this setting we again find that classical ESS are 
preserved subject to edge density restrictions. Since the degree
assumption is somewhat strong, we also prove another result
which only assumes that |En| ≥ n1+γ
, and shows that there
must exist at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of
higher fitness (as opposed to showing that all but o(n) 
mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness). As will
be discussed, this rules out stationary mutant invasions.
5.1 Random Graphs, Adversarial Mutations
Now we state and prove a theorem which shows that if s
is a classical ESS, then s will be an ESS for random graphs,
where a linear sized set of mutants is chosen by an adversary.
Theorem 5.1. Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game,
and suppose s is a classical ESS of F. Let the infinite
graph family {Gn}∞
n=0 be drawn according to Gn,p, where
p = Ω(1/nc
) and 0 ≤ c < 1. Then with probability 1, s is
an ESS.
The main idea of the proof is to divide mutants into 2
categories, those with normal fitness and those with 
ab202
normal fitness. First, we show all but o(n) of the 
population (incumbent or mutant) have an incumbent neighbor of
normal fitness. This will imply that all but o(n) of the 
mutants of normal fitness have an incumbent neighbor of higher
fitness. The vehicle for proving this is Theorem 2.15 of [5],
which gives an upper bound on the number of vertices not
connected to a sufficiently large set. This theorem assumes
that the size of this large set is known with equality, which
necessitates the union bound argument below. Secondly, we
show that there can be at most o(n) mutants with abnormal
fitness. Since there are so few of them, even if none of them
have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness, s will still be
an ESS with respect to F and G.
Proof. (Sketch) Let t = s be the mutant strategy. Since
s is a classical ESS, there exists an t such that (1− )F(s|s)+
F(s|t) > (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t), for all 0 < < t. Let M
be any mutant family that is t-linear. Thus for any fixed
value of n that is sufficiently large, there exists an such
that |Mn| = n and t > > 0. Also, let In = Vn \ Mn and
let I ⊆ In be the set of incumbents that have fitness in the
range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)] for some constant τ,
0 < τ < 1/6. Lemma 5.1 below shows (1 − )n ≥ |I | ≥
(1 − )n − 24 log n
τ2p
. Finally, let
TI = {x ∈ V \ I : Γ(x) ∩ I = ∅}.
(For the sake of clarity we suppress the subscript n on the
sets I and T.) The union bound gives us
Pr(|TI | ≥ δn) ≤
(1− )n
X
i=(1− )n− 24 log n
τ2p
Pr(|TI | ≥ δn and |I | = i) (1)
Letting δ = n−γ
for some γ > 0 gives δn = o(n). We will
apply Theorem 2.15 of [5] to the summand on the right hand
side of Equation 1. If we let γ = (1−c)/2, and combine this
with the fact that 0 ≤ c < 1, all of the requirements of this
theorem will be satisfied (details omitted). Now when we
apply this theorem to Equation 1, we get
Pr(|TI | ≥ δn) ≤

This is because equation 2 has only 24 log n

terms, and
Theorem 2.15 of [5] gives us that C ≥ (1 − )n1−c
− 24 log n
τ2 .
Thus we have shown, with probability tending to 1 as n →
∞, at most o(n) individuals are not attached to an 
incumbent which has fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) +
F(s|t)]. This implies that the number of mutants of 
approximately normal fitness, not attached to an incumbent
of approximately normal fitness, is also o(n).
Now those mutants of approximately normal fitness that
are attached to an incumbent of approximately normal 
fitness have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t)].
The incumbents that they are attached to have fitness in the
range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)]. Since s is an ESS of F,
we know (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t), thus
if we choose τ small enough, we can ensure that all but o(n)
mutants of normal fitness have a neighboring incumbent of
higher fitness.
Finally by Lemma 5.1, we know there are at most o(n) 
mutants of abnormal fitness. So even if all of them are more fit
than their respective incumbent neighbors, we have shown
all but o(n) of the mutants have an incumbent neighbor of
higher fitness.
We now state and prove the lemma used in the proof
above.
Lemma 5.1. For almost every graph Gn,p with (1 − )n
incumbents, all but 24 log n
δ2p
incumbents have fitness in the
range (1±δ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)], where p = Ω(1/nc
) and
, δ and c are constants satisfying 0 < < 1, 0 < δ < 1/6,
0 ≤ c < 1. Similarly, under the same assumptions, all
but 24 log n
δ2p
mutants have fitness in the range (1 ± δ)[(1 −
)F(t|s) + F(t|t)].
Proof. We define the mutant degree of a vertex to be
the number of mutant neighbors of that vertex, and 
incumbent degree analogously. Observe that the only way for
an incumbent to have fitness far from its expected value of
(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) is if it has a fraction of mutant 
neighbors either much higher or much lower than . Theorem
2.14 of [5] gives us a bound on the number of such 
incumbents. It states that the number of incumbents with mutant
degree outside the range (1 ± δ)p|M| is at most 12 log n
δ2p
. By
the same theorem, the number of incumbents with 
incumbent degree outside the range (1 ± δ)p|I| is at most 12 log n
δ2p
.
From the linearity of fitness as a function of the fraction
of mutant or incumbent neighbors, one can show that for
those incumbents with mutant and incumbent degree in the
expected range, their fitness is within a constant factor of
(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), where that constant goes to 1 as n
tends to infinity and δ tends to 0. The proof for the mutant
case is analogous.
We note that if in the statement of Theorem 5.1 we let
c = 0, then p = 1. This, in turn, makes G = {Kn}∞
n=0,
where Kn is a clique of n vertices. Then for any Kn all
of the incumbents will have identical fitness and all of the
mutants will have identical fitness. Furthermore, since s was
an ESS for G, the incumbent fitness will be higher than the
mutant fitness. Finally, one can show that as n → ∞, the
incumbent fitness converges to (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), and
the mutant fitness converges to (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). In
other words, s must be a classical ESS, providing a converse
to Theorem 5.1. We rigorously present this argument in
Section A.1.
5.2 Adversarial Graphs, Random Mutations
We now move on to our second main result. Here we show
that if the graph family, rather than being chosen randomly,
is arbitrary subject to a minimum degree requirement, and
the mutation sets are randomly chosen, classical ESS are
again preserved. A modified notion of ESS allows us to
considerably weaken the degree requirement to a minimum
edge density requirement.
Theorem 5.2. Let G = {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞
n=0 be an 
infinite family of graphs in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ
)
(for any constant γ > 0). Let F be any 2-player, symmetric
game, and suppose s is a classical ESS of F. Let t be any
mutant strategy, and let the mutant family M = {Mn}∞
n=0 be
chosen randomly by labeling each vertex a mutant with 
constant probability , where t > > 0. Then with probability
1, s is an ESS with respect to F, G and M.
203
Proof. Let t = s be the mutant strategy and let X be
the event that every incumbent has fitness within the range
(1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)], for some constant τ > 0 to
be specified later. Similarly, let Y be the event that every
mutant has fitness within the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) +
F(t|t)]. Since Pr(X ∩ Y ) = 1 − Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ), we proceed
by showing Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ) = o(1).
¬X is the event that there exists an incumbent with fitness
outside the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)]. If degM (v)
denotes the number of mutant neighbors of v, similarly,
degI (v) denotes the number of incumbent neighbors of v,
then an incumbent i has fitness
degI (i)
deg(i)
F(s|s)+
degM (i)
deg(i)
F(s|t).
Since F(s|s) and F(s|t) are fixed quantities, the only 
variation in an incumbents fitness can come from variation in the
terms degI (i)
deg(i)
and degM (i)
deg(i)
. One can use the Chernoff bound
followed by the union bound to show that for any incumbent
i,
Pr(F(i) /∈ (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)])
< 4 exp

Next one can use the union bound again to bound the 
probability of the event ¬X,
Pr(¬X) ≤ 4n exp

diτ2

where di = mini∈V \M deg(i), 0 < ≤ 1/2. An analogous
argument can be made to show Pr(¬Y ) < 4n exp(−

where dj = minj∈M deg(j) and 0 < ≤ 1/2. Thus, by the
union bound,
Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ) < 8n exp

where d = minv∈V deg(v), 0 < ≤ 1/2. Since deg(v) =

than 0,
lim
n→∞
8n
exp ( dτ2/3)
= 0,
so Pr(¬X∪¬Y ) = o(1). Thus, we can choose τ small enough
such that (1 + τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)] < (1 − τ)[(1 −
)F(s|s)+ F(s|t)], and then choose n large enough such that
with probability 1 − o(1), every incumbent will have fitness
in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+F(s|t)], and every mutant
will have fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)].
So with high probability, every incumbent will have a higher
fitness than every mutant.
By arguments similar to those following the proof of 
Theorem 5.1, if we let G = {Kn}∞
n=0, each incumbent will have
the same fitness and each mutant will have the same fitness.
Furthermore, since s is an ESS for G, the incumbent fitness
must be higher than the mutant fitness. Here again, one
has to show show that as n → ∞, the incumbent fitness
converges to (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), and the mutant fitness
converges to (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). Observe that the exact
fraction mutants of Vn is now a random variable. So to prove
this convergence we use an argument similar to one that is
used to prove that sequence of random variables that 
converges in probability also converges in distribution (details
omitted). This in turn establishes that s must be a classical
ESS, and we thus obtain a converse to Theorem 5.2. This
argument is made rigorous in Section A.2.
The assumption on the degree of each vertex of 
Theorem 5.2 is rather strong. The following theorem relaxes
this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have
n1+γ
edges, for some constant γ > 0, in which case it shows
there will alway be at least 1 mutant with an incumbent
neighbor of higher fitness. A strategy that is an ESS in
this weakened sense will essentially rule out stable, static
sets of mutant invasions, but not more complex invasions.
An example of more complex invasions are mutant sets that
survive, but only by perpetually migrating through the
graph under some natural evolutionary dynamics, akin to
gliders in the well-known Game of Life [1].
Theorem 5.3. Let F be any game, and let s be a classical
ESS of F, and let t = s be a mutant strategy. For any graph
family G = {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞
n=0 in which |En| ≥ n1+γ
(for
any constant γ > 0), and any mutant family M = {Mn}∞
n=0
which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with
probability , where t > > 0, the probability that there
exists a mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness
approaches 1 as n → ∞.
Proof. (Sketch) The main idea behind the proof is to
show that with high probability, over only the choice of 
mutants, there will be an incumbent-mutant edge in which both
vertices have high degree. If their degree is high enough, we
can show that close to an fraction of their neighbors are
mutants, and thus their fitnesses are very close to what we
expect them to be in the classical case. Since s is an ESS,
the fitness of the incumbent will be higher than the mutant.
We call an edge (i, j) ∈ En a g(n)-barbell if deg(i) ≥ g(n)
and deg(j) ≥ g(n). Suppose Gn has at most h(n) edges that
are g(n)-barbells. This means there are at least |En| − h(n)
edges in which at least one vertex has degree at most g(n).
We call these vertices light vertices. Let (n) be the number
of light vertices in Gn. Observe that |En|−h(n) ≤ (n)g(n).
This is because each light vertex is incident on at most g(n)
edges. This gives us that
|En| ≤ h(n) + (n)g(n) ≤ h(n) + ng(n).
So if we choose h(n) and g(n) such that h(n) + ng(n) =
o(n1+γ
), then |En| = o(n1+γ
). This contradicts the 
assumption that |En| = Ω(n1+γ
). Thus, subject to the above
constraint on h(n) and g(n), Gn must contain at least h(n)
edges that are g(n)-barbells.
Now let Hn denote the subgraph induced by the barbell
edges of Gn. Note that regardless of the structure of Gn,
there is no reason that Hn should be connected. Thus, let
m be the number of connected components of Hn, and let
c1, c2, . . . , cm be the number of vertices in each of these 
connected components. Note that since Hn is an edge-induced
subgraph we have ck ≥ 2 for all components k. Let us choose
the mutant set by first flipping the vertices in Hn only. We
now show that the probability, with respect to the random
mutant set, that none of the components of Hn have an
incumbent-mutant edge is exponentially small in n. Let An
be the event that every component of Hn contains only 
mutants or only incumbents. Then algebraic manipulations can
establish that
Pr[An] = Πm
k=1( ck
+ (1 − )ck
)
≤ (1 − )(1− β2

Pm
k=1 ck

where β is a constant. Thus for sufficiently small the bound
decreases exponentially with

k=1 ck. Furthermore, sincePm
k=1
`ck

´
≥ h(n) (with equality achieved by making each
component a clique), one can show that
Pm
k=1 ck ≥
p
h(n).
Thus, as long as h(n) → ∞ with n, the probability that all
components are uniformly labeled will go to 0.
Now assuming that there exists a non-uniformly labeled
component, by construction that component contains an
edge (i, j) where i is an incumbent and j is a mutant, that
is a g(n)-barbell. We also assume that the h(n) vertices
already labeled have been done so arbitrarily, but that the
remaining g(n) − h(n) vertices neighboring i and j are 
labeled mutants independently with probability . Then via
a standard Chernoff bound argument, one can show that
with high probability, the fraction of mutants neighboring
i and the fraction of mutants neighboring j is in the range
(1 ± τ)(g(n)−h(n))
g(n)
. Similarly, one can show that the 
fraction of incumbents neighboring i and the fraction of mutants
neighboring j is in the range 1 − (1 ± τ)(g(n)−h(n))
g(n)
.
Since s is an ESS, there exists a ζ > 0 such that (1 −
)F(s|s) + F(s|t) = (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t) + ζ. If we
choose g(n) = nγ
, and h(n) = o(g(n)), we can choose n
large enough and τ small enough to force F(i) > F(j), as
desired.
