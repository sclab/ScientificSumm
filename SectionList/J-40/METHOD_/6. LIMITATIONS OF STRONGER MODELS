In this section we show that if one tried to strengthen
the model described in Section 3 in two natural ways, one
would not be able to prove results as strong as Theorems 5.1
and 5.2, which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game.
6.1 Stronger Contraction for the Mutant Set
In Section 3 we alluded to the fact that we made certain
design decisions in arriving at Definitions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.
One such decision was to require that all but o(n) mutants
have incumbent neighbors of higher fitness. Instead, we
could have required that all mutants have an incumbent
neighbor of higher fitness. The two theorems in this 
subsection show that if one were to strengthen our notion of
contraction for the mutant set, given by Definition 3.1, in
this way, it would be impossible to prove theorems analogous
to Theorems 5.1 and 5.3.
Recall that Definition 3.1 gave the notion of contraction
for a linear sized subset of mutants. In what follows, we
will say an edge (i, j) contracts if i is an incumbent, j is a
mutant, and F(i) > F(j). Also, recall that Theorem 5.1
stated that if s is a classical ESS, then it is an ESS for
random graphs with adversarial mutations. Next, we prove
that if we instead required every incumbent-mutant edge to
contract, this need not be the case.
Theorem 6.1. Let F be a 2-player, symmetric game that
has a classical ESS s for which there exists a mutant 
strategy t = s with F(t|t) > F(s|s) and F(t|t) > F(s|t). Let
G = {Gn}∞
n=0 be an infinite family of random graphs drawn
according to Gn,p, where p = Ω(1/nc
) for any constant
0 ≤ c < 1. Then with probability approaching 1 as n → ∞,
there exists a mutant family M = {Mn}∞
n=0, where tn >
|Mn| > n and t, > 0, in which there is an edge that does
not contract.
Proof. (Sketch) With probability approaching 1 as n →
∞, there exists a vertex j where deg(j) is arbitrarily close
to n. So label j mutant, label one of its neighbors 
incumbent, denoted i, and label the rest of j"s neighborhood
mutant. Also, label all of i"s neighbors incumbent, with
the exception of j and j"s neighbors (which were already
labeled mutant). In this setting, one can show that F(j)
will be arbitrarily close to F(t|t) and F(i) will be a convex
combination of F(s|s) and F(s|t), which are both strictly
less than F(t|t).
Theorem 5.3 stated that if s is a classical ESS, then for
graphs where |En| ≥ n1+γ
, for some γ > 0, and where each
organism is labeled a mutant with probability , one edge
must contract. Below we show that, for certain graphs and
certain games, there will always exist one edge that will not
contract.
Theorem 6.2. Let F be a 2-player, symmetric game that
has a classical ESS s, such that there exists a mutant 
strategy t = s where F(t|s) > F(s|t). There exists an infinite
family of graphs {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞
n=0, where |En| = Θ(n2
),
such that for a mutant family M = {Mn}∞
n=0, which is 
determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability
> 0, the probability there exists an edge in En that does
not contract approaches 1 as n → ∞.
Proof. (Sketch) Construct Gn as follows. Pick n/4 
vertices u1, u2, . . . , un/4 and add edges such that they from
a clique. Then, for each ui, i ∈ [n/4] add edges (ui, vi),
(vi, wi) and (wi, xi). With probability 1 as n → ∞, there
exists an i such that ui and wi are mutants and vi and xi
are incumbents. Observe that F(vi) = F(xi) = F(s|t) and
F(wi) = F(t|s).
6.2 Stronger Contraction for Individuals
The model of Section 3 requires that for an edge (i, j) to
contract, the fitness of i must be greater than the fitness of j.
One way to strengthen this notion of contraction would be
to require that the maximum fitness incumbent in the 
neighborhood of j be more fit than the maximum fitness mutant
in the neighborhood of j. This models the idea that each
organism is trying to take over each place in its 
neighborhood, but only the most fit organism in the neighborhood
of a vertex gets the privilege of taking it. If we assume that
we adopt this notion of contraction for individual mutants,
and require that all incumbent-mutant edges contract, we
will next show that Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 still hold, and
thus it is still impossible to get results such as Theorems 5.1
and 5.3 which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game.
In the proof of Theorem 6.1 we proved that F(i) is strictly
less than F(j). Observe that maximum fitness mutant in
the neighborhood of j must have fitness at least F(j). Also
observe that there is only 1 incumbent in the neighborhood
of j, namely i. So under this stronger notion of contraction,
the edge (i, j) will not contract.
Similarly, in the proof of Theorem 6.2, observe that the
only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself, which
has fitness F(t|s). Furthermore, the only incumbents in the
neighborhood of wi are vi and xi, both of which have fitness
F(s|t). By assumption, F(t|s) > F(s|t), thus, under this
stronger notion of contraction, neither of the 
incumbentmutant edges, (vi, wi) and (xi, wi), will contract.
