The fundamental concept of evolutionary game theory is
the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Intuitively, an ESS
is a strategy such that if all the members of a population
adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the 
population [17]. To make this more precise, we describe the basic
model of evolutionary game theory, in which the notion of
an ESS resides.
The standard model of evolutionary game theory 
considers an infinite population of organisms, each of which plays
a strategy in a fixed, 2-player, symmetric game. The game
is defined by a fitness function F. All pairs of members of
the infinite population are equally likely to interact with one
another. If two organisms interact, one playing strategy s
200
and the other playing strategy t, the s-player earns a fitness
of F(s|t) while the t-player earns a fitness of F(t|s).
In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a
1 − fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms
incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t,
and call these organisms mutants. Assume two organisms
are chosen uniformly at random to play each other. The
strategy s is an ESS if the expected fitness of an 
organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t,
for all t = s and all sufficiently small . Since an 
incumbent will meet another incumbent with probability 1 −
and it will meet a mutant with probability , we can 
calculate the expected fitness of an incumbent, which is simply
(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t). Similarly, the expected fitness of
a mutant is (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). Thus we come to the
formal definition of an ESS [19].
Definition 2.1. A strategy s is an evolutionarily stable
strategy (ESS) for the 2-player, symmetric game given by
fitness function F, if for every strategy t = s, there exists
an t such that for all 0 < < t, (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t) >
(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).
A consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ESS,
it must be the case that F(s|s) ≥ F(t|s), for all strategies
t. This inequality means that s must be a best response
to itself, and thus any ESS strategy s must also be a Nash
equilibrium. In general the notion of ESS is more 
restrictive than Nash equilibrium, and not all 2-player, symmetric
games have an ESS.
In this paper our interest is to examine what kinds of 
network structure preserve the ESS strategies for those games
that do have a standard ESS. First we must of course 
generalize the definition of ESS to a network setting.
