Asynchronous communication is a useful communication
paradigm for mobile ad-hoc networks, as hosts are allowed to
come, go and pick up messages when convenient, also taking
account of their resource availability (e.g., power, 
connectivity levels). In this paper we have described the state of the
art in terms of MOM for mobile systems. We have also
shown a proof of concept adaptation of JMS to the extreme
scenario of partially connected mobile ad-hoc networks.
We have described and discussed the characteristics and
differences of our solution with respect to traditional JMS
implementations and the existing adaptations for mobile 
settings. However, trade-offs between application-level routing
and resource usage should also be investigated, as mobile
devices are commonly power/resource scarce. A key 
limitation of this work is the poorly performing epidemic 
algorithm and an important advance in the practicability of
this work requires an algorithm that better balances the
needs of efficiency and message delivery probability. We
are currently working on algorithms and protocols that, 
exploiting probabilistic and statistical techniques on the basis
of small amounts of exchanged information, are able to 
improve considerably the efficiency in terms of resources 
(memory, bandwidth, etc) and the reliability of our middleware
platform [13].
One futuristic research development, which may take these
ideas of adaptation of messaging middleware for mobile 
environments further is the introduction of more mobility 
oriented communication extensions, for instance the support
of geocast (i.e., the ability to send messages to specific 
geographical areas).
