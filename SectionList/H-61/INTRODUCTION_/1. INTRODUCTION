The emergence of the Internet has opened up new 
marketing opportunities. In fact, a company has now the possibility
of showing its advertisements (ads) to millions of people at a
low cost. During the 90"s, many companies invested heavily
on advertising in the Internet with apparently no concerns
about their investment return [16]. This situation radically
changed in the following decade when the failure of many
Web companies led to a dropping in supply of cheap venture
capital and a considerable reduction in on-line advertising
investments [15,16].
It was clear then that more effective strategies for on-line
advertising were required. For that, it was necessary to take
into account short-term and long-term interests of the users
related to their information needs [9,14]. As a consequence,
many companies intensified the adoption of intrusive 
techniques for gathering information of users mostly without
their consent [8]. This raised privacy issues which 
stimulated the research for less invasive measures [16].
More recently, Internet information gatekeepers as, for 
example, search engines, recommender systems, and 
comparison shopping services, have employed what is called paid
placement strategies [3]. In such methods, an advertiser
company is given prominent positioning in advertisement
lists in return for a placement fee. Amongst these methods,
the most popular one is a non-intrusive technique called 
keyword targeted marketing [16]. In this technique, keywords
extracted from the user"s search query are matched against
keywords associated with ads provided by advertisers. A
ranking of the ads, which also takes into consideration the
amount that each advertiser is willing to pay, is computed.
The top ranked ads are displayed in the search result page
together with the answers for the user query.
The success of keyword targeted marketing has motivated
information gatekeepers to offer their advertisement services
in different contexts. For example, as shown in Figure 1,
relevant ads could be shown to users directly in the pages of
information portals. The motivation is to take advantage of
496
the users immediate information interests at browsing time.
The problem of matching ads to a Web page that is browsed,
which we also refer to as content-targeted advertising [1],
is different from that of keyword marketing. In this case,
instead of dealing with users" keywords, we have to use the
contents of a Web page to decide which ads to display.
Figure 1: Example of content-based advertising in
the page of a newspaper. The middle slice of the
page shows the beginning of an article about the
launch of a DVD movie. At the bottom slice, we can
see advertisements picked for this page by Google"s
content-based advertising system, AdSense.
It is important to notice that paid placement 
advertising strategies imply some risks to information gatekeepers.
For instance, there is the possibility of a negative impact
on their credibility which, at long term, can demise their
market share [3]. This makes investments in the quality of
ad recommendation systems even more important to 
minimize the possibility of exhibiting ads unrelated to the user"s
interests. By investing in their ad systems, information 
gatekeepers are investing in the maintenance of their credibility
and in the reinforcement of a positive user attitude towards
the advertisers and their ads [14]. Further, that can 
translate into higher clickthrough rates that lead to an increase in
revenues for information gatekeepers and advertisers, with
gains to all parts [3].
In this work, we focus on the problem of content-targeted
advertising. We propose new strategies for associating ads
with a Web page. Five of these strategies are referred to as
matching strategies. They are based on the idea of matching
the text of the Web page directly to the text of the ads and
its associated keywords. Five other strategies, which we here
introduce, are referred to as impedance coupling strategies.
They are based on the idea of expanding the Web page with
new terms to facilitate the task of matching ads and Web
pages. This is motivated by the observation that there is 
frequently a mismatch between the vocabulary of a Web page
and the vocabulary of an advertisement. We say that there
is a vocabulary impedance problem and that our technique
provides a positive effect of impedance coupling by reducing
the vocabulary impedance. Further, all our strategies rely
on information that is already available to information 
gatekeepers that operate keyword targeted advertising systems.
Thus, no other data from the advertiser is required.
Using a sample of a real case database with over 93,000
ads and 100 Web pages selected for testing, we evaluate our
ad recommendation strategies. First, we evaluate the five
matching strategies. They match ads to a Web page 
using a standard vector model and provide what we may call
trivial solutions. Our results indicate that a strategy that
matches the ad plus its keywords to a Web page, requiring
the keywords to appear in the Web page, provides 
improvements in average precision figures of roughly 60% relative
to a strategy that simply matches the ads to the Web page.
Such strategy, which we call AAK (for ads and keywords),
is then taken as our baseline.
Following we evaluate the five impedance coupling 
strategies. They are based on the idea of expanding the ad and
the Web page with new terms to reduce the vocabulary
impedance between their texts. Our results indicate that it
is possible to generate extra improvements in average 
precision figures of roughly 50% relative to the AAK strategy.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we 
introduce five matching strategies to solve content-targeted
advertising. In section 3, we present our impedance 
coupling strategies. In section 4, we describe our experimental
methodology and datasets and discuss our results. In 
section 5 we discuss related work. In section 6 we present our
conclusions.
