Several works have stressed the importance of relevance
in advertising. For example, in [14] it was shown that 
advertisements that are presented to users when they are not
interested on them are viewed just as annoyance. Thus,
in order to be effective, the authors conclude that 
advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the
time of exposure. The results in [9] enforce this conclusion
by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the
more effective it is.
Therefore it is not surprising that other works have 
addressed the relevance issue. For instance, in [8] it is proposed
a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online 
advertisement to a user"s short-term interests in a non-intrusive
way. Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use
the content of the page viewed by the user. It relies on search
keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the
URL of the page requested by the user. On the other hand,
in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which
an agent sits between advertisers and the user"s browser 
allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.
In spite of having the opportunity to use the page"s content,
502
the agent infers relevance based on category information and
user"s private information collected along the time.
In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the 
ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword
advertising systems. Both systems select advertisements by
matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a
search query and rank the resulting advertisement list 
according to the advertisers" willingness to pay. In 
particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate
of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its 
relevance. The authors conclude that Google"s strategy is better
than that used by Overture. As mentioned before, the 
ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of
content-targeted advertising. Instead of dealing with 
keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal
with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.
Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search 
engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic
query expansion method based on kNN [17]. Such method
resembles our expansion approach presented in section 3.
Our method is different from that presented by [4]. They
expand user queries applied to a document collection with
terms extracted from the top k documents returned as 
answer to the query in the same collection. In our case, we
use two collections: an advertisement and a Web collection.
We expand triggering pages with terms extracted from the
Web collection and then we match these expanded pages to
the ads from the advertisement collection. By doing this, we
emphasize the main topics of the triggering pages, increasing
the possibility of associating relevant ads with them.
