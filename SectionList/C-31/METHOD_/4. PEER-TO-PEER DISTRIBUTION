Apocrita uses a peer-to-peer distribution model in order to
distribute files. Files are distributed solely from a serving node to
a client node without regard for the availability of file pieces from
other clients in the network. This means that the file transfers will
be fast and efficient and should not severely affect the usability of
serving nodes from the point of view of a local user. The JXTA
framework [5] is used in order to implement peer-to-peer
functionality. This has been decided due to the extremely 
shorttimeline of the project which allows us to take advantage of over
five years of testing and development and support from many
large organizations employing JXTA in their own products. We
are not concerned with any potential quality problems because
JXTA is considered to be the most mature and stable peer-to-peer
framework available.
Using JXTA terminology, there are three types of peers used in
node classification.
Edge peers are typically low-bandwidth, non-dedicated nodes.
Due to these characteristics, edge peers are not used with
Apocrita.
Relay peers are typically higher-bandwidth, dedicated nodes.
This is the classification of all nodes in the Apocrita network, and,
as such, are the default classification used.
Rendezvous peers are used to coordinate message passing
between nodes in the Apocrita network. This means that a
minimum of one rendezvous peer per subnet is required.
4.1 Peer Discovery
The Apocrita server subsystem uses the JXTA Peer Discovery
Protocol (PDP) in order to find participating peers within the
network as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Apocrita peer discovery process.

The PDP listens for peer advertisements from other nodes in the
Apocrita swarm. If a peer advertisement is detected, the server
will attempt to join the peer group and start actively contributing
to the network. If no peers are found by the discovery service, the
server will create a new peer group and start advertising this peer
group. This new peer group will be periodically advertised on the
network; any new peers joining the network will attach to this
peer group. A distinct advantage of using the JXTA PDP is that
Apocrita does not have to be sensitive to particular networking
nuances such as Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). In
addition, Apocrita does not have to support one-to-many packet
delivery methods such as multicast and instead can rely on JXTA
for this support.
4.2 Index Query Operation
All nodes in the Apocrita swarm have a complete and up-to-date
copy of the network index stored locally. This makes querying the
index for search results trivial. Unlike the Gnutella protocol, a
query does not have to propagate throughout the network. This
also means that the time to return query results is very fast - much
faster than protocols that rely on nodes in the network to pass the
query throughout the network and then wait for results. This is
demonstrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Apocrita query operation.
Each document in the swarm has a unique document
identification number (ID). A node will query the index and a
result will be returned with both the document ID number as well
as a list of peers with a copy of the matched document ID. It is
then the responsibility of the searching peer to contact the peers in
the list to negotiate file transfer between the client and server.
