Apocrita uses the Lucene framework [7], which is a project under
development by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache
Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. In the current implementation,
Apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents.
Apocrita uses the JXTA framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport
library between nodes. JXTA is used to pass both messages and
files between nodes in the search network. By using JXTA,
Apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer
transport mechanism. It uses the pipe facility in order to pass
messages and files between nodes. The pipe facility provides
many different types of pipe advertisements. This includes an
unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated
unsecured pipe.
Message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in
order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval. For example, a
node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will
query nodes via the message facility. Idle nodes will reply with a
status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.
File passing is used within Apocrita for file transfer. After a file
has been searched for and located within the peer group, a JXTA
socket will be opened and file transfer will take place. A JXTA
socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA
socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport. File
passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.
File passing is also used within Apocrita for index transfer. Index
transfer works exactly like a file transfer. In fact, the index
transfer actually passes the index as a file. However, there is one
key difference between file transfer and index transfer. In the case
of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes. In the
case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes
in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all
nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network. In
order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use
an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in
the Apocrita network.
