Apocrita is a distributed peer-to-peer file sharing system, and has
been designed to make finding documents easier in an Intranet
environment. Currently, it is possible for documents to be located
on a user's machine or on a remote machine. It is even possible
that different revisions could reside on each node on the Intranet.
This means there must be a manual process to maintain document
versions. Apocrita solves this problem using two approaches.
First, due to the inherent nature of Apocrita, the document will
only reside on a single logical location. Second, Apocrita provides
a method of reverting to previous document versions. Apocrita

will also distribute documents across multiple machines to ensure
high availability of important documents. For example, if a
machine contains an important document and the machine is
currently inaccessible, the system is capable of maintaining
availability of the document through this distribution mechanism.
It provides a simple interface for searching and accessing files
that may exist either locally or remotely. The distributed nature of
the documents is transparent to the user. Apocrita supports a
decentralized network model where the peers use a discovery
protocol to determine peers.
Apocrita is intended for network users on an Intranet. The main
focus is organizations that may not have a network large enough
to require a file server and supporting infrastructure. It eliminates
the need for documents to be manually shared between users
while being edited and reduces the possibility of conflicting
versions being distributed. The system also provides some
redundancy and in the event of a single machine failure, no
important documents will be lost. It is operating system
independent, and easy to access through a web browser or through
a standalone application. To decrease the time required for
indexing a large number of documents, the indexing process is
distributed across available idle nodes. Local and remote files
should be easily accessible through a virtual mountable file
system, providing transparency for users.
