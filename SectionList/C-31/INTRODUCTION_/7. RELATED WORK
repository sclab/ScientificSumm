Several decentralized P2P systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that
Apocrita features some of their functionality. However, Apocrita
also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make
this system unique. For example, Majestic-12 [4] is a distributed
search and indexing project designed for searching the Internet.
Each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing
a portion of the web. A central area for querying the index is
available on the Majestic-12 web page. The index itself is not
distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed. The distributed
indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals.
YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application. YaCy consists
of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p
index exchange protocol. YaCy is designed to maintain a
distributed index of the Internet. It used a distributed hash table
(DHT) to maintain the index. The local node is used to query but
all results that are returned are accessible on the Internet. YaCy
used many peers and DHT to maintain a distributed index.
Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future
implementations and may benefit from using an implementation
of a DHT. YaCy however, is designed as a web search engine
and, as such solves a much different problem than Apocrita.
