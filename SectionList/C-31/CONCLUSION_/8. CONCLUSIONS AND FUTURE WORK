We presented Apocrita, a distributed P2P searching and indexing
system intended for network users on an Intranet. It can help
organizations with no network file server or necessary network
infrastructure to share documents. It eliminates the need for
documents to be manually shared among users while being edited
and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being
distributed. A proof of concept prototype has been constructed,
but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism
and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially
envisioned. Despite these shortcomings, the experience gained
from the design and implementation of Apocrita has given us
more insight into building challenging distributed systems.
For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution
model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and
transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of
every important file will always be available regardless of the
availability of specific nodes in the network. In addition, we plan
to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution
portion of Apocrita so that users could have the ability to update
an existing file that they found and have the old revision
maintained and the new revision propagated. Finally, the current
implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the
fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node,
we plan to design a distributed index.
