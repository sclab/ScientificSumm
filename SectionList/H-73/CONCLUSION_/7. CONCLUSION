Distributed information retrieval solves the problem of finding
information that is scattered among many text databases on local
area networks and Internets. Most previous research use
effective resource selection algorithm of database
recommendation system for distributed document retrieval
application. We argue that the high-recall resource selection
goal of database recommendation and high-precision goal of
document retrieval are related but not identical. This kind of
inconsistency has also been observed in previous work, but the
prior solutions either used heuristic methods or assumed
cooperation by individual databases (e.g., all the databases used
the same kind of search engines), which is frequently not true in
the uncooperative environment.
In this work we propose a unified utility maximization model to
integrate the resource selection of database recommendation and
document retrieval tasks into a single unified framework. In this
framework, the selection decisions are obtained by optimizing
different objective functions. As far as we know, this is the first
work that tries to view and theoretically model the distributed
information retrieval task in an integrated manner.
The new framework continues a recent research trend studying
the use of query-based sampling and a centralized sample
database. A single logistic model was trained on the centralized

sample database to estimate the probabilities of relevance of
documents by their centralized retrieval scores, while the
centralized sample database serves as a bridge to connect the
individual databases with the centralized logistic model.
Therefore, the probabilities of relevance for all the documents
across the databases can be estimated with very small amount of
human relevance judgment, which is much more efficient than
previous methods that build a separate model for each database.
This framework is not only more theoretically solid but also
very effective. One algorithm for resource selection (UUM/HR)
and two algorithms for document retrieval (UUM/HP-FL and
UUM/HP-VL) are derived from this framework. Empirical
studies have been conducted on testbeds to simulate the
distributed search solutions of large organizations (companies)
or domain-specific hidden Web. Furthermore, the UUM/HP-FL
and UUM/HP-VL resource selection algorithms are extended
with a variant of SSL results merging algorithm to address the
distributed document retrieval task when selected databases do
not return document scores. Experiments have shown that these
algorithms achieve results that are at least as good as the prior
state-of-the-art, and sometimes considerably better. Detailed
analysis indicates that the advantage of these algorithms comes
from explicitly optimizing the goals of the specific tasks.
The unified utility maximization framework is open for different
extensions. When cost is associated with searching the online
databases, the utility framework can be adjusted to automatically
estimate the best number of databases to search so that a large
amount of relevant documents can be retrieved with relatively
small costs. Another extension of the framework is to consider
the retrieval effectiveness of the online databases, which is an
important issue in the operational environments. All of these are
the directions of future research.
