We have developed a fully expressive representation scheme
for coalitional games of which the size depends on the 
complexity of the interactions among the agents. Our focus
on general representation is in contrast to the approach
taken in [3, 4]. We have also developed an efficient 
algorithm for the computation of the Shapley values for this
representation. While Core-Membership for MC-nets is
coNP-complete, we have developed an algorithm for 
CoreMembership that runs in time exponential only in the treewidth
of the agent graph. We have also extended the algorithm
to solve Core-Non-Emptiness. Other than the algorithm
for Core-Non-Emptiness in [4] under the restriction of
non-negative edge weights, and that in [2] for 
superadditive games when the value of the grand coalition is given,
we are not aware of any explicit description of algorithms
for core-related problems in the literature.
The work in this paper is related to a number of areas
in computer science, especially in artificial intelligence. For
example, the graphical interpretation of MC-nets is closely
related to Markov random fields (MRFs) of the Bayes nets
community. They both address the issue of of conciseness
of representation by using the combinatorial structure of
weighted hypergraphs. In fact, Kearns et al. first apply
these idea to games theory by introducing a representation
scheme derived from Bayes net to represent non-cooperative
games [6]. The representational issues faced in coalitional
games are closely related to the problem of expressing 
valuations in combinatorial auctions [5, 10]. The OR-bid 
language, for example, is strongly related to superadditivity.
The question of the representation power of different 
patterns is also related to Boolean expression complexity [12].
We believe that with a better understanding of the 
relationships among these related areas, we may be able to develop
more efficient representations and algorithms for coalitional
games.
Finally, we would like to end with some ideas for 
extending the work in this paper. One direction to increase the
conciseness of MC-nets is to allow the definition of 
equivalent classes of agents, similar to the idea of extending Bayes
nets to probabilistic relational models. The concept of 
symmetry is prevalent in games, and the use of classes of agents
will allow us to capture symmetry naturally and concisely.
This will also address the problem of unpleasing assymetric
representations of symmetric games in our representation.
Along the line of exploiting symmetry, as the agents within
the same class are symmetric with respect to each other, we
can extend the idea above by allowing functional description
of marginal contributions. More concretely, we can specify
the value of a rule as dependent on the number of agents
of each relevant class. The use of functions will allow 
concise description of marginal diminishing returns (MDRs).
Without the use of functions, the space needed to describe
MDRs among n agents in MC-nets is O(n). With the use
of functions, the space required can be reduced to O(1).
Another idea to extend MC-nets is to augment the 
semantics to allow constructs that specify certain rules cannot be
applied simultaneously. This is useful in situations where a
certain agent represents a type of exhaustible resource, and
therefore rules that depend on the presence of the agent
should not apply simultaneously. For example, if agent i in
the system stands for coal, we can either use it as fuel for
a power plant or as input to a steel mill for making steel,
but not for both at the same time. Currently, to represent
such situations, we have to specify rules to cancel out the
effects of applications of different rules. The augmented 
semantics can simplify the representation by specifying when
rules cannot be applied together.
