Given a MC-net, we have a simple algorithm to compute
the Shapley value of the game. Considering each rule as a
separate game, we start by computing the Shapley value of
the agents for each rule. For each agent, we then sum up
the Shapley values of that agent over all the rules. We first
show that this final summing process correctly computes the
Shapley value of the agents.
Proposition 5. The Shapley value of an agent in a marginal
contribution network is equal to the sum of the Shapley 
values of that agent over each rule.
Proof. For any group S, under the MC-nets 
representation, v(S) is defined to be the sum over the values of all the
rules that apply to S. Therefore, considering each rule as a
game, by the (ADD) axiom discussed in section 2, the 
Shapley value of the game created from aggregating all the rules
is equal to the sum of the Shapley values over the rules.
The remaining question is how to compute the Shapley
values of the rules. We can separate the analysis into two
cases, one for rules with only positive literals and one for
rules with mixed literals.
For rules that have only positive literals, the Shapley value
of the agents is v/m, where v is the value of the rule and
m is the number of agents in the rule. This is a direct
consequence of the (SYM) axiom of the Shapley value, as
the agents in a rule are indistinguishable from each other.
For rules that have both positive and negative literals, we
can consider the positive and the negative literals separately.
For a given positive literal i, the rule will apply only if i
occurs in a given permutation after the rest of the positive
literals but before any of the negative literals. Formally, let
φi denote the Shapley value of i, p denote the cardinality of
the positive set, and n denote the cardinality of the negative
set, then
φi =
(p − 1)!n!
(p + n)!
v =
v
p p+n
n
For a given negative literal j, j will be responsible for 
cancelling the application of the rule if all positive literals come
before the negative literals in the ordering, and j is the first
among the negative literals. Therefore,
φj =
p!(n − 1)!
(p + n)!
(−v) =
−v
n p+n
p
By the (SYM) axiom, all positive literals will have the value
of φi and all negative literals will have the value of φj.
Note that the sum over all agents in rules with mixed
literals is 0. This is to be expected as these rules contribute
0 to the grand coalition. The fact that these rules have no
effect on the grand coalition may appear odd at first. But
this is because the presence of such rules is to define the
values of coalitions smaller than the grand coalition.
In terms of computational complexity, given that the 
Shapley value of any agent in a given rule can be computed in
time linear in the pattern of the rule, the total running time
of the algorithm for computing the Shapley value of the
game is linear in the size of the input.
