We presented a novel approach for enhancing users" Web search
interaction by providing links to websites frequently visited by past
searchers with similar information needs. A user study was
conducted in which we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed
technique compared with a query refinement system and unaided
Web search. Results of our study revealed that: (i) systems
suggesting query refinements were preferred for known-item tasks,
(ii) systems offering popular destinations were preferred for
exploratory search tasks, and (iii) destinations should be mined
from the end of query trails, not session trails. Overall, popular
destination suggestions strategically influenced searches in a way
not achievable by query suggestion approaches by offering a new
way to resolve information problems, and enhance the 
informationseeking experience for many Web searchers.
