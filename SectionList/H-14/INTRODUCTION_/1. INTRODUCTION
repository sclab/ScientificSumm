The problem of improving queries sent to Information Retrieval
(IR) systems has been studied extensively in IR research [4][11].
Alternative query formulations, known as query suggestions, can be
offered to users following an initial query, allowing them to modify
the specification of their needs provided to the system, leading to
improved retrieval performance. Recent popularity of Web search
engines has enabled query suggestions that draw upon the query
reformulation behavior of many users to make query
recommendations based on previous user interactions [10].
Leveraging the decision-making processes of many users for query
reformulation has its roots in adaptive indexing [8]. In recent years,
applying such techniques has become possible at a much larger
scale and in a different context than what was proposed in early
work. However, interaction-based approaches to query suggestion
may be less potent when the information need is exploratory, since
a large proportion of user activity for such information needs may
occur beyond search engine interactions. In cases where directed
searching is only a fraction of users" information-seeking behavior,
the utility of other users" clicks over the space of top-ranked results
may be limited, as it does not cover the subsequent browsing
behavior. At the same time, user navigation that follows search
engine interactions provides implicit endorsement of Web resources
preferred by users, which may be particularly valuable for
exploratory search tasks. Thus, we propose exploiting a
combination of past searching and browsing user behavior to
enhance users" Web search interactions.
Browser plugins and proxy server logs provide access to the
browsing patterns of users that transcend search engine interactions.
In previous work, such data have been used to improve search result
ranking by Agichtein et al. [1]. However, this approach only
considers page visitation statistics independently of each other, not
taking into account the pages" relative positions on post-query
browsing paths. Radlinski and Joachims [13] have utilized such
collective user intelligence to improve retrieval accuracy by using
sequences of consecutive query reformulations, yet their approach
does not consider users" interactions beyond the search result page.
In this paper, we present a user study of a technique that exploits the
searching and browsing behavior of many users to suggest popular
Web pages, referred to as destinations henceforth, in addition to the
regular search results. The destinations may not be among the 
topranked results, may not contain the queried terms, or may not even
be indexed by the search engine. Instead, they are pages at which
other users end up frequently after submitting same or similar
queries and then browsing away from initially clicked search
results. We conjecture that destinations popular across a large
number of users can capture the collective user experience for
information needs, and our results support this hypothesis.
In prior work, O"Day and Jeffries [12] identified teleportation as
an information-seeking strategy employed by users jumping to their
previously-visited information targets, while Anderson et al. [2]
applied similar principles to support the rapid navigation of Web
sites on mobile devices. In [19], Wexelblat and Maes describe a
system to support within-domain navigation based on the browse
trails of other users. However, we are not aware of such principles
being applied to Web search. Research in the area of recommender
systems has also addressed similar issues, but in areas such as
question-answering [9] and relatively small online communities
[16]. Perhaps the nearest instantiation of teleportation is search
engines" offering of several within-domain shortcuts below the title
of a search result. While these may be based on user behavior and
possibly site structure, the user saves at most one click from this
feature. In contrast, our proposed approach can transport users to
locations many clicks beyond the search result, saving time and
giving them a broader perspective on the available related
information.
The conducted user study investigates the effectiveness of including
links to popular destinations as an additional interface feature on
search engine result pages. We compare two variants of this
approach against the suggestion of related queries and unaided Web
search, and seek answers to questions on: (i) user preference and
search effectiveness for known-item and exploratory search tasks,
and (ii) the preferred distance between query and destination used to
identify popular destinations from past behavior logs. The results
indicate that suggesting popular destinations to users attempting
exploratory tasks provides best results in key aspects of the
information-seeking experience, while providing query refinement
suggestions is most desirable for known-item tasks.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we
describe the extraction of search and browsing trails from user
activity logs, and their use in identifying top destinations for new
queries. Section 3 describes the design of the user study, while
Sections 4 and 5 present the study findings and their discussion,
respectively. We conclude in Section 6 with a summary.
