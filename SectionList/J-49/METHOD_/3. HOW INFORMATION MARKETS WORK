Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems
from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market 
hypothesis [15]. Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in
1940"s, claims that the price system in a competitive market
is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed 
information among market participants. The efficient market
hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the
price of a security almost instantly incorporates all 
available information. The market price summarizes all relevant
information across traders, hence is the market participants"
consensus expectation about the future value of the security.
Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large 
extent [25, 27, 35]. Thus, when associating the value of a 
security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market
price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security
value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event. This
idea gives rise to information markets.
For example, if we want to predict which team will win
the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an 
information market can trade a security $100 if New England
defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the
game is specified as follow:
$100 if New England wins the game;
$0 otherwise.
The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff
of the security in an efficient market. The time value of
money usually can be ignored because durations of most
information markets are short. Assuming exposure to risk is
roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient
effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price
should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players
in the market. Thus,
p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0,
where p is the price of the security $100 if New England
defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability
that New England will win the game. Observing the security
price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win),
which is the market participants" collective prediction about
how likely it is that New England will win the game.
The above security is a winner-takes-all contract. It is
used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random
variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary). Its
price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be
realized. When the outcome of a prediction problem can be
any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security
that pays its holder proportional to the realized value. This
kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called
an index contract. It predicts the expected value of a 
future outcome. Many other aspects of a future event such as
median value of outcome can also be predicted in 
information markets by designing and trading different securities.
Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main
types of securities traded in information markets and what
statistical properties they can predict. In practice, 
conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the
many decisions in designing an effective information 
market. Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for
designing information markets.
