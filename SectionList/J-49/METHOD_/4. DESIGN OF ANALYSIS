4.1 Data Sets
Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between 
September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003. NFL games are
very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online 
exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that
provide data on both information markets and the 
opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2)
the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides
natural incentives for people to participate in information
markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of 
information markets and improves the quality and number
of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and
analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and 
individual players provide the public with much information so that
participants of information markets and the contest can be
viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.
Information market data was acquired, by using a 
specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.com"s
Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.com"s Sports
Exchange [1]. For each NFL game, both TradeSports and
NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to
predict the game outcome. We introduce the design of the
two markets according to Spann and Skiera"s three steps for
designing an information market [37] as below.
• Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both 
TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one
of the two teams will win a NFL football game. They
trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off
100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.
Small differences exist in how they deal with ties. In
the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades
that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the
security is worth 50 in NewsFutures. Since the 
probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%),
prices at both markets effectively represent the market
participants" consensus assessment of the probability
that the team will win.
• Incentive for participation and information 
revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different
incentives for participation and information revelation.
TradeSports is a real-money exchange. A trader needs
to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100
to participate in the market. Both profits and losses
can occur as a result of trading activity. On the 
contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and
get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the
time of registration. Traders at NewsFutures will not
incur any real financial loss. They can accumulate 
virtual money by trading securities. The virtual money
can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at 
NewsFutures" online shop.
• Financial market design: Both markets at 
TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double
auction as their trading mechanism. TradeSports charges
a small fee on each security transaction and expiry,
while NewsFutures does not.
We can see that the main difference between two information
markets is real money vs. virtual money. Servan-Schreiber
60
et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the 
performance of the two information markets and concluded that
the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the
same level. Not intending to compare these two markets,
we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our
findings are not accidental.
We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for
NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5],
one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6]. The contest is
free to enter. Participants of the contest are asked to enter
their subjective probability that a team will win a game
by noon on the day of the game. Importantly, the contest
evaluates the participants" performance via the quadratic
scoring rule:
s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2
, (3)
where s represents the score that a participant earns for the
game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant
assigns to the actual losing team. The quadratic score is
one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have
the property that an expert"s expected score is maximized
when the expert reports probabilities truthfully. For 
example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to
both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter
which team wins. If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to
team B, showing that he is confident in team A"s winning,
he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and
lose 156 points if team B wins. This quadratic scoring rule
rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold
predictions that turn out to be wrong. The top players, 
measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes
of the contest. The suggested strategy at the contest 
website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely
as possible, the probabilities that each team will win. This
strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize 
expected score. However, as prizes are awarded only to the top
few winners, participants" goals are to maximize the 
probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a
slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1
Still,
as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing 
available to true subjective probability judgments from so many
people over so many public events that have corresponding
information markets.
4.2 Methods of Analysis
In order to compare the prediction accuracy of 
information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive
predictions from market data of TradeSports and 
NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from 
ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures
to be used.
4.2.1 Deriving Predictions
For information markets, deriving predictions is 
straightforward. We can take the security price and divide it by
100 to get the market"s prediction of the probability that
a team will win. To match the time when participants at
the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their
probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last
trade price before noon on the day of the game. For more

to accumulated score.
than half of the games, this time is only about an hour 
earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours
earlier for other games. Two sets of market predictions are
derived:
• NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures" last trade price
before noon of the game day divided by 100.
• TS: Prediction equals TradeSports" last trade price 
before noon of the game day divided by 100.
We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data
to obtain aggregate expert predictions. The reason that we
do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data
from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical
pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches,
(2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions
about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes
and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the
large number of games and participants, making reasonable
assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches,
previous research has shown that simpler aggregation 
methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].
Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are
probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because 
assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add
a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and
subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.
In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors:
weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be
pooled. For weights of experts, we experiment with equal
weights and performance-based weights. The 
performancebased weights are determined according to previous 
accumulated score in the contest. The score for each game is
calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in
the ProbabilityFootball contest. For the first week, since no
previous scores are available, we choose equal weights. For
later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each
player. Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we
shift everyone"s score if needed to ensure the weights are
non-negative. Thus,
wi =
cumulative scorei + shift
n
j=1(cumulative scorej + shift)
. (4)
where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is
non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the 
smallest cumulative scorej otherwise. For simplicity, we call
performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally
weighted opinion pool as unweighted. We will use them 
interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.
As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool,
we form different opinion pools with different number of 
experts. Only the best performing experts are selected. For
example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions,
we choose the top 20 participants. Since there is no 
performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all 
participants in the first week. For week 2, we select opinions of
20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the
top 20. For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores
of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected. Experts
are chosen in a similar way for later weeks. Thus, the top
20 participants can change from week to week.
The possible opinion pools, varied in pooling functions,
weighting methods, and number of expert opinions, are shown

in Table 1. Lin represents linear, and Log represents
Logarithmic. n is the number of expert opinions that are
pooled, and All indicates that all opinions are combined.
We use u to symbolize unweighted (equally weighted) 
opinion pools. w is used for weighted (performance-weighted)
opinion pools. Lin-All-u, the equally weighted LinOP with
all participants, is basically the arithmetic mean of all 
participants" opinions. Log-All-u is simply the geometric mean
of all opinions.
When a participant did not enter a prediction for a 
particular game, that participant was removed from the opinion
pool for that game. This contrasts with the 
ProbabilityFootball average reported on the contest website and used
by Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], where unreported 
predictions were converted to 0.5 probability predictions.
4.2.2 Performance Measures
We use three common metrics to assess prediction 
accuracy of information markets and opinion pools. These 
measures have been used by Servan-Schreiber et. al [36] in 
evaluating the prediction accuracy of information markets.
1. Absolute Error = Prob Lose,
where Prob Lose is the probability assigned to the
eventual losing team. Absolute error simply measures
the difference between a perfect prediction (1 for 
winning team) and the actual prediction. A prediction
with lower absolute error is more accurate.
2. Quadratic Score = 100 − 400 × (Prob Lose2
).
Quadratic score is the scoring function that is used in
the ProbabilityFootball contest. It is a linear 
transformation of squared error, Prob Lose2
, which is one of
the mostly used metrics in evaluating forecasting 
accuracy. Quadratic score can be negative. A prediction
with higher quadratic score is more accurate.
3. Logarithmic Score = log(Prob W in),
where Prob W in is the probability assigned to the
eventual winning team. The logarithmic score, like
the quadratic score, is a proper scoring rule. A 
prediction with higher (less negative) logarithmic score is
more accurate.
