Clemen and Winkler [12] classify opinion pooling 
methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches
and behavioral approaches. In mathematical approaches,
the opinions of individual experts are expressed as 
subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an 
uncertain event. They are combined through various 
mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability 
distribution. Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide 
comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches. Mathematical
approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic 
approaches and Bayesian approaches. Axiomatic approaches
apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, 
expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to
a single aggregated probability distribution. These 
pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable
properties. Two of the most common pooling functions are
the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion
pool (LogOP). Using LinOP, the aggregate probability 
distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual 
probability distributions:
p(θ) =
n
i=1
wipi(θ), (1)
where pi(θ) is expert i"s probability distribution of uncertain
event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability 
distribution, wi"s are weights for experts, which are usually 
nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts. Using
LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted
geometric mean of individual probability distributions:
p(θ) = k
n
i=1
pi(θ)wi
, (2)
where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled
opinion is a probability distribution. Other axiomatic 
pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23],
or both [13]. Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the
early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods. Bayesian
approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a
prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood
function over expert opinions given the event. This decision
maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its 
priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule. The
resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled
opinion.
Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the
field of group decision making and organizational 
behavior. The important assumption of behavioral approaches is
that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts
can eventually reach an equilibrium where further 
interaction won"t change their opinions. One of the best known
behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28]. 
Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open 
discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other
experts, and is given feedback. Experts then can reassess
their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a
smaller spread of opinions is achieved. Some other 
behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14],
promote open discussions in controlled environments.
Each approach has its pros and cons. Axiomatic 
approaches are easy to use. But they don"t have a normative
basis to choose weights. In addition, several impossibility
results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation 
function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool,
unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual
opinion, which effectively implies a dictator. Bayesian 
approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian 
framework. However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to 
apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely
complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often 
impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not
to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making
strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional 
independence of experts. Behavior approaches allow experts to
dynamically improve their information and revise their 
opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or
completely specified, and can"t guarantee convergence or 
repeatability.
