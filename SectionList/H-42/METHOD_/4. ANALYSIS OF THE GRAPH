4.1 Weighted Inlinks, Outlinks, PageRank
The sum of weighted outlinks, i.e., the sum of the weights
on the outgoing arcs from each node, is always zero:
• The outlinks on each node corresponding to a system
s (Fig. 2c) is the sum of all the corresponding APM
values on one row of the matrix in Tab. 2b.
• The outlinks on each node corresponding to a topic
t (Fig. 2d) is the sum of all the corresponding APA
(a) (b)
(c) (d)

topics (a) and (b); and the Systems-Topics graph for
a toy example (c) and (d). Dashed arcs correspond
to negative values.

The average1
of weighted inlinks is:
• MAP for each node corresponding to a system s; this
corresponds to the average of all the corresponding
APA values on one column of the APA

part of the
adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).
• AAP for each node corresponding to a topic t; this
corresponds to the average of all the corresponding
APM values on one column of the APM part of the
adjacency matrix (see Fig. 1).
Therefore, weighted inlinks measure either system 
effectiveness or topic ease; weighted outlinks are not meaningful. We
could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network;
the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so 
obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible
measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a 
system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high

Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to
each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is
complete, it makes no difference.
weights (APA); if a topic is easy it will have high weights
(APM) on the incoming links too. We will see experimental
confirmation in the following.
4.2 Hubs and Authorities
Let us now turn to more sophisticated indicators. 
Kleinberg"s HITS algorithm defines, for a directed graph, two
indicators: hubness and authority; we reiterate here some of
the basic details of the HITS algorithm in order to 
emphasize both the nature of our generalization and the 
interpretation of the HITS concepts in this context. Usually, hubness
and authority are defined as h(x) =
P
x→y a(y) and a(x) =
P
y→x h(y), and described intuitively as a good hub links
many good authorities; a good authority is linked from many
good hubs. As it is well known, an equivalent formulation
in linear algebra terms is (see also Fig. 3):
h = Aa and a = AT
h (7)
(where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all
the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency 
matrix of the graph; and AT
its transpose). Usually, A 
contains 0s and 1s only, corresponding to presence and absence
of unweighted directed arcs, but Eq. (7) can be immediately
generalized to (in fact, it is already valid for) A containing
any real value, i.e., to weighted graphs.
Therefore we can have a generalized version (or rather
a generalized interpretation, since the formulation is still
the original one) of hubness and authority for all nodes in
a graph. An intuitive formulation of this generalized HITS
is still available, although slightly more complex: a good
hub links, by means of arcs having high weights, many good
authorities; a good authority is linked, by means of arcs 
having high weights, from many good hubs. Since arc weights
can be, in general, negative, hub and authority values can be
negative, and one could speak of unhubness and unauthority;
the intuitive formulation could be completed by adding that
a good hub links good unauthorities by means of links with
highly negative weights; a good authority is linked by good
unhubs by means of links with highly negative weights.
And, also, a good unhub links positively good 
unauthorities and negatively good authorities; a good unauthority
is linked positively from good unhubs and negatively from
good hubs.
Let us now apply generalized HITS to our Systems-Topics
graph. We compute a(s), h(s), a(t), and h(t). Intuitively,
we expect that a(s) is somehow similar to Inlinks, so it
should be a measure of either systems effectiveness or topic
ease. Similarly, hubness should be more similar to Outlinks,
thus less meaningful, although the interplay between hub
and authority might lead to the discovery of something 
different. Let us start by remarking that authority of topics
and hubness of systems depend only on each other; similarly
hubness of topics and authority of systems depend only on
each other: see Figs. 2c, 2d and 3.
Thus the two graphs in Figs. 2c and 2d can be analyzed
independently. In fact the entire HITS analysis could be
done in one direction only, with just APM(s, t) values or
alternatively with just APA(s, t). As discussed below, 
probably most interest resides in the hubness of topics and the
authority of systems, so the latter makes sense. However, in
this paper, we pursue both analyses together, because the
symmetry itself is interesting.
Considering Fig. 2c we can state that:
• Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when:
- if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases
(or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases);
- if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases
(or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases).
• Hubness h(s) of a system node s increases when:
- if a(tj) > 0, APM(s, tj) increases
(or, if APM(s, tj) > 0, a(tj) increases);
- if a(tj) < 0, APM(s, tj) decreases
(or, if APM(s, tj) < 0, a(tj) decreases).
We can summarize this as: a(t) is high if APM(s, t) is high
for those systems with high h(s); h(s) is high if APM(s, t)
is high for those topics with high a(t). Intuitively, authority
a(t) of a topic measures topic ease; hubness h(s) of a system
measures system"s capability to recognize easy topics. A
system with high unhubness (negative hubness) would tend
to regard easy topics as hard and hard ones as easy.
The situation for Fig. 2d, i.e., for a(s) and h(t), is 
analogous. Authority a(s) of a system node s measures system
effectiveness: it increases with the weight on the arc (i.e.,
APA(s, tj)) and the hubness of the incoming topic nodes tj.
Hubness h(t) of a topic node t measures topic capability to
recognize effective systems: if h(t) > 0, it increases further
if APA(s, tj) increases; if h(t) < 0, it increases if APA(s, tj)
decreases.
Intuitively, we can state that A system has a higher 
authority if it is more effective on topics with high hubness;
and A topic has a higher hubness if it is easier for those
systems which are more effective in general. Conversely for
system hubness and topic authority: A topic has a higher
authority if it is easier on systems with high hubness; and
A system has a higher hubness if it is more effective for
those topics which are easier in general.
Therefore, for each system we have two indicators: 
authority (a(s)), measuring system effectiveness, and hubness
(h(s)), measuring system capability to estimate topic ease.
And for each topic, we have two indicators: authority (a(t)),
measuring topic ease, and hubness (h(t)), measuring topic
capability to estimate systems effectiveness. We can define
them formally as
a(s) =
X
t
h(t) · APA(s, t), h(t) =
X
s
a(s) · APA(s, t),
a(t) =
X
s
h(s) · APM(s, t), h(s) =
X
t
a(t) · APM(s, t).
We observe that the hubness of topics may be of particular
interest for evaluation studies. It may be that we can 
evaluate the effectiveness of systems efficiently by using relatively
few high-hubness topics.
