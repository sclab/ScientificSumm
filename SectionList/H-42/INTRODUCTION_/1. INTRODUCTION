Evaluation is a primary concern in the Information 
Retrieval (IR) field. TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) [12,
15] is an annual benchmarking exercise that has become a
de facto standard in IR evaluation: before the actual 
conference, TREC provides to participants a collection of 
documents and a set of topics (representations of information
needs). Participants use their systems to retrieve, and 
submit to TREC, a list of documents for each topic. After the
lists have been submitted and pooled, the TREC organizers
employ human assessors to provide relevance judgements on
the pooled set. This defines a set of relevant documents for
each topic. System effectiveness is then measured by well 
established metrics (Mean Average Precision being the most
used). Other conferences such as NTCIR, INEX, CLEF 
provide comparable data.
Network analysis is a discipline that studies features and
properties of (usually large) networks, or graphs. Of 
particular importance is Social Network Analysis [16], that studies
networks made up by links among humans (friendship, 
acquaintance, co-authorship, bibliographic citation, etc.).
Network analysis and IR fruitfully meet in Web Search
Engine implementation, as is already described in textbooks
[3,6]. Current search engines use link analysis techniques to
help rank the retrieved documents. Some indicators (and
the corresponding algorithms that compute them) have been
found useful in this respect, and are nowadays well known:
Inlinks (the number of links to a Web page), PageRank [7],
and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) [5]. Several
extensions to these algorithms have been and are being 
proposed. These indicators and algorithms might be quite 
general in nature, and can be used for applications which are
very different from search result ranking. One example is
using HITS for stemming, as described by Agosti et al. [1].
In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method
for constructing a network, specifically a weighted complete
bidirectional directed bipartite graph, on a set of TREC 
topics and participating systems. Links represent effectiveness
measurements on system-topic pairs. We then apply 
analysis methods originally developed for search applications to
the resulting network. This reveals phenomena previously
hidden in TREC data. In passing, we also provide a small
generalization to Kleinberg"s HITS algorithm, as well as to
Inlinks and PageRank.
The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives some 
motivations for the work. Sect. 3 presents the basic ideas of
normalizing average precision and of constructing a 
systemstopics graph, whose properties are analyzed in Sect. 4; Sect. 5
presents some experiments on TREC 8 data; Sect. 6 
discusses some issues and Sect. 7 closes the paper.
