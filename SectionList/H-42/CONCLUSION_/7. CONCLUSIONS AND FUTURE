DEVELOPMENTS
The contribution of this paper is threefold:
• we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values;
• we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data;
• the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal
some hidden properties.
More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision
(AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of 
normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis
of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP. The
normalized measures (APM and APA) are used to build a
bipartite weighted Systems-Topics graph, that is then 
analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known
in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat 
generalised. We note that no such approach to TREC data
analysis has been proposed so far. The analysis shows that,
with current measures, a system that wants to be effective
in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics. Also, it is 
suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to
relying on a lower number of topics.
Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can
be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the 
topics and all the systems available. Adding (removing) a new
system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and 
authority indicators. Moreover, we are not explicitly proposing
a change to current TREC methodology, although this could
be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.
This is an initial work, and further analyses could be 
performed. For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be
used, in place of AP. Other centrality indicators, widely
used in social network analysis, could be computed, although
probably with similar results to PageRank. It would be 
interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of AT
A
and AAT
. The same kind of analysis could be performed at
the document level, measuring document ease. Hopefully,
further analyses of the graph defined in this paper, 
according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better
understanding of TREC or similar data.
