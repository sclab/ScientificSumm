We have presented an SVM method that directly 
optimizes MAP. It provides a principled approach and avoids
difficult to control heuristics. We formulated the 
optimization problem and presented an algorithm which provably
finds the solution in polynomial time. We have shown 
empirically that our method is generally superior to or 
competitive with conventional SVMs methods.
Our new method makes it conceptually just as easy to
optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only
for Accuracy and ROCArea. The computational cost for
training is very reasonable in practice. Since other methods
typically require tuning multiple heuristics, we also expect
to train fewer models before finding one which achieves good
performance.
The learning framework used by our method is fairly 
general. A natural extension of this framework would be to
develop methods to optimize for other important IR 
measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain [2,
3, 4, 12] and Mean Reciprocal Rank.
