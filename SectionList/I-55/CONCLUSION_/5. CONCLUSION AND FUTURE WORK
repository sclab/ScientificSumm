In this paper we have established a framework for negotiation
that is based on MCDM theory for representing the agents" 
objectives and utilities. The focus of the paper is on integrative 
negotiation in which agents aim to maximise joint gains, or create value.

We have introduced a mediator into the negotiation in order to 
allow negotiators to disclose information about their utilities, 
without providing this information to their opponents. Furthermore, the
mediator also works toward the goal of achieving fairness of the
negotiation outcome.
That is, the approach that we describe aims for both efficiency, in
the sense that it produces Pareto optimal outcomes (i.e. no aspect
can be improved for one of the parties without worsening the 
outcome for another party), and also for fairness, which chooses 
optimal solutions which distribute gains amongst the agents in some
appropriate manner. We have developed a two step process for 
addressing the NP-hard problem of finding a solution for a set of 
integrative attributes, which is within the Pareto-optimal set for those
attributes. For simple attributes (i.e. those which have a finite set
of values) we use known optimisation techniques to find a 
Paretooptimal solution. In order to discourage agents from 
misrepresenting their utilities to gain an advantage, we look for solutions that
are least vulnerable to manipulation. We have shown that as long
as one of the simple attributes does not strongly dominate the 
others, then truth telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators
during the stage of optimising simple attributes. For non-simple 
attributes we propose a mechanism that provides stepwise 
improvements to move the proposed solution in the direction of a 
Paretooptimal solution.
The approach presented in this paper is similar to the ideas 
behind negotiation analysis [18]. Ehtamo et al [4] presents an 
approach to searching for joint gains in multi-party negotiations. The
relation of their approach to our approach is discussed in the 
preceding section. Lai et al [12] provide an alternative approach to
integrative negotiation. While their approach was clearly described
for the case of two-issue negotiations, the generalisation to 
negotiations with more than two issues is not entirely clear.
Zhang et at [22] discuss the use of integrative negotiation in
agent organisations. They assume that agents are honest. Their
main result is an experiment showing that in some situations, agents"
cooperativeness may not bring the most benefits to the organisation
as a whole, while giving no explanation. Jonker et al [7] consider
an approach to multi-attribute negotiation without the use of a 
mediator. Thus, their approach can be considered a complement of
ours. Their experimental results show that agents can reach 
Paretooptimal outcomes using their approach.
The details of the approach have currently been shown only for
bilateral negotiation, and while we believe they are generalisable to
multiple negotiators, this work remains to be done. There is also
future work to be done in more fully characterising the outcomes
of the determination of values for the non-simple attributes. In 
order to provide a complete framework we are also working on the
distributive phase using the mediator.
