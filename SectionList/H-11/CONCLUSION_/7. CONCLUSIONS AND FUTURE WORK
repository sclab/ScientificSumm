This paper describes a novel active learning algorithm,
called Laplacian Optimal Design, to enable more effective
relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based
on an objective function which simultaneously minimizes the
empirical error and preserves the local geometrical structure
of the data space. Using techniques from experimental 
design, our algorithm finds the most informative images to
label. These labeled images and the unlabeled images in
the database are used to learn a classifier. The 
experimental results on Corel database show that both active learning
and semi-supervised learning can significantly improve the
retrieval performance.
In this paper, we consider the image retrieval problem on
a small, static, and closed-domain image data. A much more
challenging domain is the World Wide Web (WWW). For
Web image search, it is possible to collect a large amount
of user click information. This information can be naturally
used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm. 
However, the computational complexity in Web scenario may 
become a crucial issue. Also, although our primary interest in
this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval,
our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten
recognition and machine learning, especially when a large
amount of data is available but only a limited samples can
be labeled.
