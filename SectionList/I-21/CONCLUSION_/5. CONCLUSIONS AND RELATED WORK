Purchasing behaviour in many markets takes place on
a substrate of networks of word-of-mouth communication
across which agents exchange information about products
and their likes and dislikes. Understanding the ways in
which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence 
aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the
underlying structural properties of the network and the 
local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network
when making purchase decisions and when interacting with
other agents. These local rules are often constrained by the
nature of a particular market, or else imposed by 
strategic suppliers or social customs. The proper modelling of a
mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting 
behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of
complex and interacting components: networks of 
communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation
and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of
information transfer, and adaptive behaviour. In this 
paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in
a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real
world.
Using the key notions of a limited communication 
network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic
that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1)
the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both
system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree 
distribution of a network is more influential than the way in
which agents are connected, but that both are important in
more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small
number of connections to create a small-world network can
have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to 
satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that
word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements
between products are constrained by market barriers, and
(5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a
result of market barriers can reduce the market share 
collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent
on the existence of a suitably well-connected network 
structure.
It is the final finding that is likely to be most 
surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field,
and suggests that it may not always be in the best 
interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent 
customers from leaving. In poorly-connected networks, the 
effect of barriers on market shares is slight. In contrast, in
well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can 
prevent agents from trying a product that they might 
otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant
harm on market share. Products with small market share
(which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to
the product offering poor performance) are relatively 
unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials
are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.
Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for 
beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in 
marketing systems. Naturally the usefulness of results is for the
most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the
two â€˜modules" comprising network structure and local 
behaviour. On the network side, future work might investigate
the relationship between degree distributions, the way 
connections are created and destroyed over time, whether 
preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which
social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger 
networks of more heterogenous agents. On the behavioural side,
one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds
during the course of communication, responses to systematic
changes in product performances over time, the integration
of various information sources, and different market barrier
structures. All these areas provide fascinating opportunities
to introduce psychological realities into models of 
marketing systems and to observe the resulting behaviour of the
system under increasingly realistic scenario descriptions.
