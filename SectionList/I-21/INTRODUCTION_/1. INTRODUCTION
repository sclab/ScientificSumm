Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop 
using a particular product or service, largely depends on the
psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward
the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more
attractive alternatives [17]. However, in many cases the 
decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on
various external constraints that are placed on switching 
behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the 
suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts),
or other so-called â€˜switching costs" or market barriers [12, 5].
The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which
psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making
is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are 
prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would
be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.
While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used 
product will largely be a function of one"s own experiences of
the product over the period of use, knowledge of any 
potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained
by augmenting the information gained from personal 
experiences with information about the experiences of others 
gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication. Moreover,
there is an important relationship between market barriers
and word-of-mouth communication. In the presence of 
market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in 
dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this
information to other agents. In the absence of such 
barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products
and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be
of the positive variety. Since the imposition of at least some
forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken
by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the
success of a particular supplier.
In addition, the relationship between market barriers and
word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one. The
structure and function of the network across which 
word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the
way in which the network changes in response to the 
imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining
which market barriers are most effective. These are complex
questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address
the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which
network structure influences the ways in which information
is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the
extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination,
and (c) the consequent implications for overall system 
performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are 
satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards
equilibrium, which we term stability.
An agent-based model framework allows for an 
investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the
387

product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are 
particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for
the latter two. The model presented here allows for an 
investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried
out in a complex environment where at every time period
each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of
products to purchase. These decisions are based on 
multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as
well as from the referrals of agents. Agents use this gathered
information to search for a product that exceeds their 
satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may
be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).
Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue
to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory 
performance. We allow agents to hold different opinions about
the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral
from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.
Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of
other agents" referrals according to the success of past 
referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not
to make use of any further referrals. The level of 
satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently
dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product
performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount
the performance of a product they have used for a long time
- a process akin to habituation.
