3.1 Product performance evaluations
We use a problem representation in which, at each time
period, every agent must decide which one of a set of 
products to choose. Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents,
B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m
be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be
based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice
one. Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function 
providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so
that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances
respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective
opinion function of agents. The intrinsic performance of
388 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi). However, the
subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i
on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).
All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective 
performance ratings. For the purposes of this paper, each agent
belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group
possessing its own subjective performance ratings.
We assume that the subjective performance ratings are
not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to 
discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration
and referral gathering. In order to model this process we 
introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time
t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t). Initially, all perceived 
performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a
product is done randomly. Subsequent variation in product
performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a
random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion
ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary
over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a 
habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived
performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in
with repeated usage. Our habituation mechanism supposes
that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product,
and is used to discount the performance of the product.
In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or
extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting
eventually leads to defection, after which the level of 
habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being
used. More formally, once a product i∗
has been chosen by
agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and
pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗
i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗
i ))Hi∗kt + jkt,
where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an 
decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has
been exposed to i∗
.
In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make
use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived
performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction
thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1. Agent
k will be satisfied with a product i∗
selected in time t if
pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗
i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j.
3.2 Decision processes
In designing the mechanism by which agents make their
choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied
agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying
them. Satisfied agents stay with their current product with
probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied
agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when
Pr(stay) = 1.
A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to
choose by considering all other products for which it has
information, either by previous personal exploration or by
referrals from other agents. The selection of a new 
product begins by the agent identifying those products from
which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance
on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where
δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a 
product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to
−δik. If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent
is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those
products that offer at least a minimum level of ‘acceptable"
performance γ−
k . The minimum level of acceptability is 
defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations
across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e.
a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ−
k .
Agents then select a product at random from the set of 
minimally acceptable products. If the set of minimally 
acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full
set of products B at random.
The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely
similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the 
exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will
chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the
set of remaining products, with probability α. With 
probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one
outlined above for satisfied agents.
3.3 Constraints on decision processes
In some circumstances market barriers may exist that
make switching between products more difficult, 
particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of
changing one"s choice of product. When barriers are present,
agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but
rather only when the performance evaluation drops below
some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures
the strength of the market barriers. Although in this 
paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is
straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers
take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗
), where β∗ is a
barrier to defection that is applied when the product is 
purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is
the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional
time period the product is used for, and β∗
is the maximum
possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary
over products i.e. be a function of i.
3.4 Referral processes
Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents
i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.
The network over which word-of-mouth communication 
travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which 
networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of
agents into ‘communities" and a short average path length
between any two agents in the network, and preferential
attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of
existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.
This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice
with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or
fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network
by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections
in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent,
with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to
its number of existing connections. This results in a 
distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent
i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.
In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified
so that new connections are added with preferential 
attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of
qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a
non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal
number of connections seems more realistic in the context
of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.
When an agent purchases a product, they inform each
of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to
Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity
of agent k∗
to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389
extent to which the agent"s most recent experience was 
satisfying or dissatisfying. Agents are thus more likely to spread
word-of-mouth about products that they have just 
experienced as either very good or very bad. If an agent receives
information on the same product from more than one agent,
he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with
selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗
, k), the degree
to which previous referrals from k∗
to k were successful i.e.
resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents
have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents"
referrals and use this information to accept or block future
referrals. In this paper, we employ a learning condition in
which Tt(k∗
, k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an
unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying
referral. The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that
employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an 
unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a
referring agent k∗
does not possess the same subjective 
preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the
converse.
Other referral process are certainly possible, for 
example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather
than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main 
reason for employing the process described above is 
simplicity. Integrating different sources considerably complicates
the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others,
and raises further questions about the precise nature of the
integration.
After determining who contacts whom, the actual 
referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the
perceived level of performance of an experience of product
i∗
from the referring agent k∗
to the accepting agent k i.e.
pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j,
provided that agent k is not currently using i∗
. Information
about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will
ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is
currently using. In effect, the referral creates an expected
level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for
the product referred to, which that agent may then use when
making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the
decision processes outlined in the previous section. Once an
agent has personally experienced a product, any expected
performance levels suggested by previous referrals are 
replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels
sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗
, k) is adjusted depending on
whether the experience was a satisfying one or not.
