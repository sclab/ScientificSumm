Combinatorial auctions have recently received a lot of 
attention. In a combinatorial auction, a set M of m 
nonidentical items are sold in a single auction to n competing
bidders. The bidders have preferences regarding the bundles
of items that they may receive. The preferences of bidder i
are specified by a valuation function vi : 2M
→ R+
, where
vi(S) denotes the value that bidder i attaches to winning the
bundle of items S. We assume free disposal, i.e., that the
vi"s are monotone non-decreasing. The usual goal of the 
auctioneer is to optimize the social welfare
P
i vi(Si), where the
allocation S1...Sn must be a partition of the items. 
Applications include many complex resource allocation problems
and, in fact, combinatorial auctions may be viewed as the
common abstraction of many complex resource allocation
problems. Combinatorial auctions face both economic and
computational difficulties and are a central problem in the
recently active border of economic theory and computer 
science. A forthcoming book [11] addresses many of the issues
involved in the design and implementation of combinatorial
auctions.
The design of a combinatorial auction involves many 
considerations. In this paper we focus on just one central 
issue: the communication between bidders and the allocation
mechanism - preference elicitation. Transferring all 
information about bidders" preferences requires an infeasible
(exponential in m) amount of communication. Thus, 
direct revelation auctions in which bidders simply declare
their preferences to the mechanism are only practical for
very small auction sizes or for very limited families of bidder
preferences. We have therefore seen a multitude of suggested
iterative auctions in which the auction protocol repeatedly
interacts with the different bidders, aiming to adaptively
elicit enough information about the bidders" preferences as
to be able to find a good (optimal or close to optimal) 
allocation.
Most of the suggested iterative auctions proceed by 
maintaining temporary prices for the bundles of items and 
repeatedly querying the bidders as to their preferences between the
bundles under the current set of prices, and then updating
the set of bundle prices according to the replies received
(e.g., [22, 12, 17, 37, 3]). Effectively, such an iterative 
auction accesses the bidders" preferences by repeatedly making
the following type of demand query to bidders: Query to
bidder i: a vector of bundle prices p = {p(S)}S⊆M ; Answer:
a bundle of items S ⊆ M that maximizes vi(S) − p(S)..
These types of queries are very natural in an economic 
setting as they capture the revealed preferences of the 
bidders. Some auctions, called item-price or linear-price 
auctions, specify a price pi for each item, and the price of any
given bundle S is always linear, p(S) =
P
i∈S pi. Other
auctions, called bundle-price auctions, allow specifying 
arbitrary (non-linear) prices p(S) for bundles. Another 
important differentiation between models of iterative auctions is
29
based on whether they use anonymous or non-anonymous
prices: In some auctions the prices that are presented to the
bidders are always the same (anonymous prices). In other
auctions (non-anonymous), different bidders may face 
different (discriminatory) vectors of prices. In ascending-price
auctions, forcing prices to be anonymous may be a 
significant restriction.
In this paper, we embark on a systematic analysis of the
computational power of iterative auctions that are based
on demand queries. We do not aim to present auctions for
practical use but rather to understand the limitations and
possibilities of these kinds of auctions. In the first part of
this paper, our main question is what can be done using a
polynomial number of these types of queries? That is, 
polynomial in the main parameters of the problem: n, m and the
number of bits t needed for representing a single value vi(S).
Note that from an algorithmic point of view we are talking
about sub-linear time algorithms: the input size here is 
really n(2m
− 1) numbers - the descriptions of the valuation
functions of all bidders. There are two aspects to 
computational efficiency in these settings: the first is the 
communication with the bidders, i.e., the number of queries made, and
the second is the usual computational tractability. Our
lower bounds will depend only on the number of 
queriesand hold independently of any computational assumptions
like P = NP. Our upper bounds will always be 
computationally efficient both in terms of the number of queries
and in terms of regular computation. As mentioned, this 
paper concentrates on the single aspect of preference elicitation
and on its computational consequences and does not address
issues of incentives. This strengthens our lower bounds, but
means that the upper bounds require evaluation from this
perspective also before being used in any real combinatorial
auction.1
The second part of this paper studies the power of 
ascending -price auctions. Ascending auctions are iterative 
auctions where the published prices cannot decrease in time. In
this work, we try to systematically analyze what do the 
differences between various models of ascending auctions mean.
We try to answer the following questions: (i) Which models
of ascending auctions can find the optimal allocation, and for
which classes of valuations? (ii) In cases where the optimal
allocation cannot be determined by ascending auctions, how
well can such auctions approximate the social welfare? (iii)
How do the different models for ascending auctions compare?
Are some models computationally stronger than others?
Ascending auctions have been extensively studied in the
literature (see the recent survey by Parkes [35]). Most of this
work presented "upper bounds", i.e., proposed mechanisms
with ascending prices and analyzed their properties. A 
result which is closer in spirit to ours, is by Gul and Stacchetti
[17], who showed that no item-price ascending auction can
always determine the VCG prices, even for substitutes 
valuations.2
Our framework is more general than the traditional
line of research that concentrates on the final allocation and

We do observe however that some weak incentive 
property comes for free in demand-query auctions since myopic
players will answer all demand queries truthfully. We also
note that in some cases (but not always!) the incentives
issues can be handled orthogonally to the preference 
elicitation issues, e.g., by using Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
prices (e.g., [4, 34]).

We further discuss this result in Section 5.3.

payments and in particular, on reaching "Walrasian 
equilibria" or "Competitive equilibria". A Walrasian equilibrium3
is known to exist in the case of Substitutes valuations, and
is known to be impossible for any wider class of valuations
[16]. This does not rule out other allocations by ascending
auctions: in this paper we view the auctions as a 
computational process where the outcome - both the allocation
and the payments - can be determined according to all the
data elicited throughout the auction; This general 
framework strengthens our negative results.4
We find the study of ascending auctions appealing for 
various reasons. First, ascending auctions are widely used in
many real-life settings from the FCC spectrum auctions [15]
to almost any e-commerce website (e.g., [2, 1]). Actually,
this is maybe the most straightforward way to sell items: ask
the bidders what would they like to buy under certain prices,
and increase the prices of over-demanded goods. Ascending
auctions are also considered more intuitive for many bidders,
and are believed to increase the trust of the bidders in the
auctioneer, as they see the result gradually emerging from
the bidders" responses. Ascending auctions also have other
desired economic properties, e.g., they incur smaller 
information revelation (consider, for example, English auctions
vs. second-price sealed bid auctions).
1.1 Extant Work
Many iterative combinatorial auction mechanisms rely on
demand queries (see the survey in [35]). Figure 1 
summa3
A Walrasian equilibrium is vector of item prices for which
all the items are sold when each bidder receives a bundle in
his demand set.

In few recent auction designs (e.g., [4, 28]) the payments
are not necessarily the final prices of the auctions.

rizes the basic classes of auctions implied by combinations
of the above properties and classifies some of the auctions
proposed in the literature according to this classification.
For our purposes, two families of these auctions serve as
the main motivating starting points: the first is the 
ascending item-price auctions of [22, 17] that with computational
efficiency find an optimal allocation among (gross) 
substitutes valuations, and the second is the ascending 
bundleprice auctions of [37, 3] that find an optimal allocation
among general valuations - but not necessarily with 
computational efficiency. The main lower bound in this area,
due to [32], states that indeed, due to inherent 
communication requirements, it is not possible for any iterative auction
to find the optimal allocation among general valuations with
sub-exponentially many queries. A similar exponential lower
bound was shown in [32] also for even approximating the 
optimal allocation to within a factor of m1/2−
. Several lower
bounds and upper bounds for approximation are known for
some natural classes of valuations - these are summarized
in Figure 2.
In [32], the universal generality of demand queries is also
shown: any non-deterministic communication protocol for
finding an allocation that optimizes the social welfare can
be converted into one that only uses demand queries (with
bundle prices). In [41] this was generalized also to 
nondeterministic protocols for finding allocations that satisfy
other natural types of economic requirements (e.g., 
approximate social efficiency, envy-freeness). However, in [33] it was
demonstrated that this completeness of demand queries
holds only in the nondeterministic setting, while in the usual
deterministic setting, demand queries (even with bundle 
prices) may be exponentially weaker than general 
communication.
Bundle-price auctions are a generalization of (the more
natural and intuitive) item-price auctions. It is known that
indeed item-price auctions may be exponentially weaker: a
nice example is the case of valuations that are a XOR of k
bundles5
, where k is small (say, polynomial). Lahaie and
Parkes [24] show an economically-efficient bundle-price 
auction that uses a polynomial number of queries whenever k is
polynomial. In contrast, [7] show that there exist valuations
that are XORs of k =
√
m bundles such that any item-price
auction that finds an optimal allocation between them 
requires exponentially many queries. These results are part
of a recent line of research ([7, 43, 24, 40]) that study the
preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions
and its relation to the full elicitation problem (i.e., 
learn5
These are valuations where bidders have values for k 
specific packages, and the value of each bundle is the maximal
value of one of these packages that it contains.
ing the exact valuations of the bidders). These papers adapt
methods from machine-learning theory to the 
combinatorialauction setting. The preference elicitation problem and the
full elicitation problem relate to a well studied problem in
microeconomics known as the integrability problem (see, e.g.,
[27]). This problem studies if and when one can derive the
utility function of a consumer from her demand function.
Paper organization: Due to the relatively large 
number of results we present, we start with a survey of our new
results in Section 2. After describing our formal model in
Section 3, we present our results concerning the power of 
demand queries in Section 4. Then, we describe the power of
item-price ascending auctions (Section 5) and bundle-price
ascending auctions (Section 6). Readers who are mainly
interested in the self-contained discussion of ascending 
auctions can skip Section 4.
Missing proofs from Section 4 can be found in part I of
the full paper ([8]). Missing proofs from Sections 5 and 6
can be found in part II of the full paper ([9]).
