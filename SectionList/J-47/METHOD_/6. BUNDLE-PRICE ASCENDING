AUCTIONS
All the ascending auctions in the literature that are proved
to find the optimal allocation for unrestricted valuations are
non-anonymous bundle-price auctions (iBundle(3) by Parkes
and Ungar [37] and the Proxy Auction by Ausubel and
Milgrom [3]). Yet, several anonymous ascending auctions
have been suggested (e.g., AkBA [42], [21] and iBundle(2)
[37]). In this section, we prove that anonymous bundle-price
ascending auctions achieve poor results in the worst-case.
We also show that the family of non-anonymous 
bundleprice ascending auctions can run exponentially slower than
simple item-price ascending auctions.
6.1 Limitations of Anonymous Bundle-Price
Ascending Auctions
We present a class of valuations that cannot be elicited
by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions. These 
valuations are described in Figure 7. The basic idea: for 
determining some unknown value of one bidder we must raise
24
Note that an anonymous ascending auction cannot 
necessarily elicit a class that can be fully elicited by an ascending
auction.
25
Substitute valuations are defined, e.g., in [16]. Roughly
speaking, a bidder with a substitute valuation will continue
demand a certain item after the price of some other items
was increased. For completeness, we present in the full paper
[9] a proof for the efficiency of such auctions for substitutes
valuations.
26
A unit-demand valuation is an XOR valuation in which
all the atomic bundles are singletons. OXS valuations can
be interpreted as an aggregation (OR) of any number of
unit-demand bidders.
Bid. 1 v1(ac) = 2 v1(bd) = 2 v1(cd) = α ∈ (0, 1)
Bid. 2 v2(ab) = 2 v2(cd) = 2 v2(bd) = β ∈ (0, 1)

a price of a bundle that should be demanded by the other
bidder in the future.
Theorem 6.1. Some classes of valuations cannot be 
elicited by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions.
Proof. Consider a pair of XOR valuations as described
in Figure 7. For finding the optimal allocation we must know
which value is greater between α and β.27
However, we 
cannot learn the value of both α and β by a single ascending
trajectory: assume w.l.o.g. that bidder 1 demands cd before
bidder 2 demands bd (no information will be elicited if none
of these happens). In this case, the price for bd must be
greater than 1 (otherwise, bidder 1 prefers bd to cd). Thus,
bidder 2 will never demand the bundle bd, and no 
information will be elicited about β.
The valuations described in the proof of Theorem 6.1 can
be easily elicited by a non-anonymous item-price ascending
auction. On the other hand, the valuations in Figure 6 can
be easily elicited by an anonymous bundle-price ascending
auction. We conclude that the power of these two families
of ascending auctions is incomparable.
We strengthen the impossibility result above by showing
that anonymous bundle-price auctions cannot even achieve
better than a min{O(n), O(
√
m)}-approximation for the 
social welfare. This approximation ratio can be achieved with
polynomial communication, and specifically with a 
polynomial number of item-price demand queries.28

auction cannot guarantee better than a min{ n

approximation for the optimal welfare.
Proof. (Sketch) Assume we have n bidders and n2
items
for sale, and that n is prime. We construct n2
distinct 
bundles with the following properties: for each bidder, we define
a partition Si
= (Si
1, ..., Si
n) of the n2
items to n bundles,
such that any two bundles from different partitions intersect.
In the full paper, part II [9] we show an explicit construction
using the properties of linear functions over finite fields. The
rest of the proof is independent of the specific construction.
Using these n2
bundles we construct a hard-to-elicit
class. Every bidder has an atomic bid, in his XOR valuation,
for each of these n2
bundles. A bidder i has a value of 2 for
any bundle Si
j in his partition. For all bundles in the other
partitions, he has a value of either 0 or of 1 − δ, and these
values are unknown to the auctioneer. Since every pair of
bundles from different partitions intersect, only one bidder
can receive a bundle with a value of 2.
27
If α > β, the optimal allocation will allocate cd to bidder
1 and ab to bidder 2. Otherwise, we give bd to bidder 2 and
ac to bidder 1. Note that both bidders cannot gain a value
of 2 in the same allocation, due to the intersections of the
high-valued bundles.
28
Note that bundle-price queries may use exponential 
communication, thus the lower bound of [32] does not hold.

Non-anonymous Bundle-Price Economically-Efficient
Ascending Auctions:
Initialization: All prices are initialized to zero
(non-anonymous bundle prices).
Repeat: - Each bidder submits a bundle that maximizes his
utility under his current personalized prices.
- The auctioneer calculates a provisional allocation that
maximizes his revenue under the current prices.
- The prices of bundles that were demanded by losing
bidders are increased by .
Finally: Terminate when the provisional allocation assigns
to each bidder the bundle he demanded.
Figure 8: Auctions from this family (denoted by NBEA
auctions) are known to achieve the optimal welfare.
No bidder will demand a low-valued bundle, as long as the
price of one of his high-valued bundles is below 1 (and thus
gain him a utility greater than 1). Therefore, for eliciting
any information about the low-valued bundles, the 
auctioneer should first arbitrarily choose a bidder (w.l.o.g bidder
1) and raise the prices of all the bundles (S1
1 , ..., S1
n) to be
greater than 1. Since the prices cannot decrease, the other
bidders will clearly never demand these bundles in future
stages. An adversary may choose the values such that the
low values of all the bidders for the bundles not in bidder 1"s
partition are zero (i.e., vi(S1
j ) = 0 for every i = 1 and every
j), however, allocating each bidder a different bundle from
bidder 1"s partition, might achieve a welfare of n+1−(n−1)δ
(bidder 1"s valuation is 2, and 1 − δ for all other bidders);
If these bundles were wrongly allocated, only a welfare of
2 might be achieved (2 for bidder 1"s high-valued bundle, 0
for all other bidders). At this point, the auctioneer cannot
have any information about the identity of the bundles with
the non-zero values. Therefore, an adversary can choose the
values of the bundles received by bidders 2, ..., n in the final
allocation to be zero. We conclude that anonymous 
bundleprice auctions cannot guarantee a welfare greater than 2 for
this class, where the optimal welfare can be arbitrarily close
to n + 1.
6.2 Bundle Prices vs. Item Prices
The core of the auctions in [37, 3] is the scheme described
in Figure 8 (in the spirit of [35]) for auctions with 
nonanonymous bundle prices. Auctions from this scheme end
up with the optimal allocation for any class of valuations.
We denote this family of ascending auctions as NBEA 
auctions29
.
NBEA auctions can elicit k-term XOR valuations by a
polynomial (in k) number of steps , although the elicitation
of such valuations may require an exponential number of
item-price queries ([7]), and item-price ascending auctions
cannot do it at all (Theorem 5.4). Nevertheless, we show
that NBEA auctions (and in particular, iBundle(3) and the
proxy auction) are sometimes inferior to simple item-price
demand auctions. This may justify the use of hybrid 
auctions that use both linear and non-linear prices (e.g., the
clock-proxy auction [10]). We show that auctions from this

paper [9] a simple proof for the efficiency (up to an ) of
auctions of this scheme .
family may use an exponential number of queries even for
determining the optimal allocation among two bidders with
additive valuations30
, where such valuations can be elicited
by a simple item-price ascending auction. We actually prove
this property for a wider class of auctions we call 
conservative auctions. We also observe that in conservative auctions,
allowing the bidders to submit all the bundles in their 
demand sets ensures that the auction runs a polynomial 
number of steps - if L is not too high (but with exponential
communication, of course).
An ascending auction is called conservative if it is 
nonanonymous, uses bundle prices initialized to zero and at 
every stage the auctioneer can only raise prices of bundles
demanded by the bidders until this stage. In addition, each
bidder can only receive bundles he demanded during the
auction. Note that NBEA auctions are by definition 
conservative.
Proposition 6.3. If every bidder demands a single 
bundle in each step of the auction, conservative auctions may
run for an exponential number of steps even for additive 
valuations. If the bidders are allowed to submit all the bundles
in their demand sets in each step, then conservative auctions
can run in a polynomial number of steps for any profile of
valuations, as long as the maximal valuation L is polynomial
in m, n and 1
δ
.
