Since 96 [15], various work have been performed on 
learning in MAS, but rather few on concept learning. In [11]
the MAS performs a form of ensemble learning in which the
agents are lazy learners (no explicit representation is 
maintained) and sell useless examples to other agents. In [10]
each agent observes all the examples but only perceive a
part of their representation. In mutual online concept 
learning [14] the agents converge to a unique hypothesis, but each
agent produces examples from its own concept 
representation, thus resulting in a kind of synchronization rather than
in pure concept learning.
