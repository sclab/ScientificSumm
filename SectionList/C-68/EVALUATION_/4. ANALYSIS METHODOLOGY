Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some
approximations as closed-form equations that capture the 
improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both 
oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids. First, we present some 
preliminaries of our analysis methodology.
• Let N be the number of cars in the network performing a 2D
random walk on a
√
G×
√
G torus. An additional car serves
as a client yielding a total of N + 1 cars. Such a mobility
model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly
because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline
against which performance of other mobility models can be
compared. Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility 
models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3,
21].
• We assume that all cars start from the stationary distribution
and perform independent random walks. Although for sparse
density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it
is no longer valid when N approaches G.
• Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also,
data item i has ri replicas. This implies ri cars, identified as
servers, have a copy of this data item when the client requests
item i.
All analysis results presented in this section are obtained 
assuming that the client is willing to wait as long as it takes for its request
to be satisfied (unbounded trip duration γ = ∞). With the random
walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as
long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the
network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2]. 
Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can
be obtained in [9].
Consider a scenario where no zebroids are employed. In this
case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the 
expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client
with any of the random walks performed by the servers. Aldous et
al. [2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such
a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the
mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.
The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for
the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of
these ri replicas for the first time. This is also an exponential 
distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation
is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG
ri
The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is
then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their
frequency of access:

4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids
Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request,
a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, 
provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.
Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client
issues the request. Let Nc
i be the expected total number of nodes
that are in the same cell as any of the ri servers. Then, we have
Nc
i = (N − ri) · (1 − (1 −
1
G
)ri
) (3)
In the analytical model, we assume that Nc
i new replicas are
created, so that the total number of replicas is increased to ri +Nc
i .
The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to
meet a replica earlier. The aggregated expected availability latency
in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by,
δagg(zeb) =
T
i=1
fi · c · G · log G
ri + Nc
i
=
T
i=1
fi · C
ri + Nc
i
(4)
Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we
have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations
in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri
servers). It thus treats all the Nc
i carriers independently, just like
the ri original servers. As we shall show below by comparison
with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on
the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower
expected latency at the client.
It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a
similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing 
oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1). Since the dispatcher is
aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the 
requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the 
zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server. This selected
zebroid is included in the Nc
i new replicas.
4.2 z-relay zebroids
To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay 
zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach
used by Spyropoulos et al. [17]. Details of the procedure to obtain
a closed-form expression are given in [9]. The aggregate 
availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by,
δagg(zeb) =
