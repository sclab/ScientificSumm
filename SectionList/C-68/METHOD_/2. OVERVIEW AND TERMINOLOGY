Table 1 summarizes the notation of the parameters used in the
paper. Below we introduce some terminology used in the paper.
Assume a network of N AutoMata-equipped cars, each with
storage capacity of α bytes. The total storage capacity of the 
system is ST =N ·α. There are T data items in the database, each with

size Si. The frequency of access to data item i is denoted as fi,
with T
j=1 fj = 1. Let the trip duration of the client AutoMata
under consideration be γ.
We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data
item i, denoted by Ri, as:
Ri =
(fi)n
T
j=1(fj)n
; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1)
The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.
A square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5].
This serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when 
zebroids are deployed. Ri is normalized to a value between 0 and
1. The number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri =
min (N, max (1, Ri·N·α
Si
)). This captures the case when at least
one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network
at all times. In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc
network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α
Si
)).
In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied
by fetching the item from a remote server.
The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined
as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first
replica of the item accessible to it. If this condition is not satisfied,
then we set δi to γ. This indicates that data item i was not available
to the client during its journey. Note that since there is at least one
replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large
value we ensure that the client"s request for any data item i will be
satisfied. However, in most practical circumstances γ may not be
so large as to find every data item.
We are interested in the availability latency observed across all
data items. Hence, we augment the average availability latency
for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted
availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T
i=1 δi · fi
Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids
are selected.
