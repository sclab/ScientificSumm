By committing, an agent can improve his strategic position. It
may even be advantageous to commit to a strategy that is strongly
dominated, i.e., one for which there is another strategy that yields
a better payoff no matter how the other agents act. Consider for 
example the 2×2 game in Figure 1, in which one player, Row, chooses
rows and another, Col, chooses columns. The entries in the matrix
indicate the payoffs to Row and Col, respectively. Then, top-left
is the solution obtained by iterative elimination of strongly 
dominated strategies: for Row, playing top is always better than playing
bottom, and assuming that Row will therefore never play bottom,
left is always better than right for Col. However, if Row succeeds
in convincing Col of his commitment to play bottom, the latter had
better choose the right column. Thus, Row attains a payoff of two
instead of one. Along a similar line of reasoning, however, Col
would wish to commit to the left column, as convincing Row of
this commitment guarantees him the most desirable outcome. If,
on the other hand, both players actually commit themselves in this
way but without convincing the other party of their having done so,
the game ends in misery for both.
Important types of commitments, however, cannot simply be 
analyzed as unconditional commitments to actions. The essence of a
threat, for example, is deterrence. If successful, it is not carried out.
(This is also the reason why the credibility of a threat is not 
necessarily undermined if its putting into effect means that the threatener
is also harmed.) By contrast, promises are made to entice and, as
such, meant to be fulfilled. Thus, both threats and promises would
be strategically void if they were unconditional.
Figure 2 shows an example, in which Col can guarantee himself
a payoff of three by threatening to choose the right column if Row
chooses top. (This will suffice to deter Row, and there is no need
for an additional promise on the part of Col.) He cannot do so by
merely committing unconditionally, and neither can Row if he were
to commit first.
In the case of conditional commitments, however, a particular
kind of inconsistency can arise. It is not in general the case that
any two commitments can both be credible. In a 2 × 2 game, it
could occur that Row commits conditionally on playing top if the

Col plays left, and bottom, otherwise. If now, Col simultaneously
were able to commit to the conditional strategy to play right if Row
plays top, and left, otherwise, there is no strategy profile that can
be played without one of the players" bluff being called.
To get around this problem, one can write down conditional 
commitments in the form of rules and define appropriate fixed point
constructions, as suggested by Samet [7] and Tennenholtz [12].
Since checking the semantic equivalence of two commitments (or
commitment conditions) is undecidable in general, Tennenholtz
bases his definition of program equilibrium on syntactic 
equivalence. We, by contrast, try to steer clear from fixed point 
constructions by assuming that the players make their commitment in
a particular order. Each player can then make his commitments 
dependent on the actions of the players to commit after him, but not
on the commitments of the players that committed before. On the
issue how this order comes about we do not here enter. Rather, we
assume it to be determined by the circumstances, which may force
or permit some players to commit earlier and others later. We will
find that it is not always beneficial to commit earlier than later or
vice versa.
Another point to heed is that we only consider the case in which
the commitments are considered absolutely binding. We do not
take into account commitments that can be violated. Intuitively,
this could be understood as that the possibility of violation fatally
undermines the credibility of the commitment. We also assume
commitments to be complete, in the sense that they fully lay down a
player"s behavior in all foreseeable circumstances. These 
assumptions imply that the outcome of the game is entirely determined by
the commitments the players make. Although these might be 
implausible assumptions for some situations, we had better study the
idealized case first, before tackling the complications of the more
general case. To make these concepts formally precise, we first
have to fix some notation.
3.1 Strategic Games
A strategic game is a tuple (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N), where N =
{1, . . . , n} is a finite set of players, Ai is a set of actions available
to player i and ui a real-valued utility function for player i on the
set of (pure) strategy profiles S = A1×· · ·×An. We call a game finite
if for all players i the action set Ai is finite. A mixed strategy σi for
a player i is a probability distribution over Ai. We write Σi for the
set of mixed strategies available to player i, and Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn
for the set of mixed strategy profiles. We further have σ(a) and
σi(a) denote the probability of action a in mixed strategy profile σ
or mixed strategy σi, respectively. In settings involving expected
utility, we will generally assume that utility functions represent
von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences. For a player i and (mixed)
strategy profiles σ and τ we write σ i τ if ui (σ) ui (τ).
3.2 Conditional Commitments
Relative to a strategic game (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N) and an 
ordering π = (π1, . . . , πn) of the players, we define the set Fπi
of (pure)
conditional commitments of a player πi as the set of functions
from Aπ1
× · · · × Aπi−1
to Aπi
. For π1 we have the set of conditional
commitments coincide with Aπ1
. By a conditional commitment 
profile f we understand any combination of conditional commitments
in Fπ1
× · · · × Fπn .
Intuitively, π reflects the sequential order in which the players
can make their commitments, with πn committing first, πn−1 second,
and so on. Each player can condition his action on the actions of
all players that are to commit after him. In this manner, each 
conditional commitment profile f can be seen to determine a unique
strategy profile, denoted by f , which will be played if all players
stick to their conditional commitments. More formally, the strategy
profile f = (fπ1
, . . . , fπn
) for a conditional commitment profile f is
defined inductively as
fπ1
=df. fπ1
,
fπi+1
=df. fπi+1
(fπ1
, . . . , fπi
).
The sequence fπ1
, (fπ1
, fπ2
), . . . , (fπ1
, . . . , fπn
) will be called the path
of f . E.g., in the two-player game of Figure 2 and given the 
order (Row, Col), Row has two conditional commitments, top and
bottom, which we will henceforth denote t and b. Col, on the other
hand, has four conditional commitments, corresponding to the 
different functions mapping strategies of Row to those of Col. If we
consider a conditional commitment f for Col such that f (t) = l
and f (b) = r, then (t, f ) is a conditional commitment profile
and (t, f ) = (t, f (t)) = (t, l).
There is a natural way in which a strategic game G together with
an ordering (π1, . . . , πn) of the players can be interpreted as an 
extensive form game with perfect information (see, e.g., [4, 6])1
, in
which π1 chooses his action first, π2 second, and so on. Observe
that under this assumption the strategies in the extensive form game
and the conditional commitments in the strategic game G with 
ordering π are mathematically the same objects. Applying backward
induction to the extensive form game yields subgame perfect 
equilibria, which arguably provide appropriate solutions in this setting.
From the perspective of conditional commitments, however, 
players move in reverse order. We will argue that under this 
interpretation other strategy profiles should be singled out as appropriate.
To illustrate this point, consider once more the game in Figure 2
and observe that neither player can improve on the outcome 
obtained via iterated strong dominance by committing 
unconditionally to some strategy. Situations like this, in which players can
make unconditional commitments in a fixed order, can fruitfully
be analyzed as extensive form games, and the most lucrative 
unconditional commitment can be found through backward induction.
Figure 3 shows the extensive form associated with the game of 
Figure 2. The strategies available to the row player are the same as in
the strategic form: choosing the top or the bottom row. The 
strategies for the column player in the extensive game are given by the
four functions that map strategies of the row player in the 
strategic game to one of his own. Transforming this extensive form
back into a strategic game (see Figure 4), we find that there exists
a second equilibrium besides the one found by means of backward
induction. This equilibrium with outcome (1, 3), indicated by the
thick lines in Figure 3, has been argued to be unacceptable in the
sequential game as it would involve an incredible threat by Col:
once Row has played top, Col finds himself confronted with a fait
accompli. He had better make the best of a bad bargain and opt
for the left column after all. This is in essence the line of thought
Selten followed in his famous argument for subgame perfect 
equilibria [10]. If, however, the strategies of Col in the extensive form
are thought of as his conditional commitments he can make in case

For a formal definition of a game in extensive form, the reader
consult one of the standard textbooks, such as [4] or [6]. In this
paper all formal definitions are based on strategic games and 
orderings of the players only.

he moves first, the situation is radically different. Thus we also 
assume that it is possible for Col to make credible the threat to choose
the right column if Row were to play top, so as to ensure the latter is
always better off to play the bottom row. If Col can make a 
conditional commitment of playing the right column if Row chooses top,
and the left column otherwise, this leaves Row with the easy choice
between a payoff of zero or one, and Col may expect a payoff of
three.
This line of reasoning can be generalized to yield an 
algorithm for finding optimal conditional commitments for general 
twoplayer games:
1. Find a strategy profile s = (sπ1
, sπ2
) with maximum payoff to
player π2, and set fπ1
= sπ1
and fπ2
(sπ1
) = sπ2
.
2. For each tπ1
∈ Aπ1
with tπ1
sπ1
, find a strategy tπ2
∈ Aπ2
that minimizes uπ1
(tπ1
, tπ2
), and set fπ2
(tπ1
) = tπ2
.
3. If uπ1
(tπ1
, fπ2
(tπ1
)) uπ1
(sπ1
, sπ2
) for all tπ1
sπ1
, return f .
4. Otherwise, find the strategy profile (sπ1
, sπ2
) with the highest
payoff to π2 among the ones that have not yet been 
considered. Set fπ1
= sπ1
and fπ2
(sπ1
) = sπ2
, and continue with
Step 2.
Generalizing the idea underlying this algorithm, we present in
Section 4 the concept of an extortion, which applies to games with
any number of players. For any order of the players an extortion
contains, for each player, an optimal commitment given the 
commitments of the players that committed earlier.
3.3 Commitment Types
So far, we have distinguished between conditional and 
unconditional commitments. If made sequentially, both of them determine
a unique strategy profile in a given strategic game. This notion of
sequential commitment allows for generalization and gives rise to
the following definition of a (sequential) commitment type.
Definition 3.1. (Sequential commitment type) A 
(sequential) commitment type τ associates with each strategic game G
and each ordering π of its players, a tuple Xπ1
, . . . , Xπn , φ ,
where Xπ1
, . . . , Xπn are (abstract) sets of commitments and φ is a
function mapping each profile in X = Xπ1
× · · · × Xπn to a (mixed)
strategy profile of G. A commitment type Xπ1
, . . . , Xπn , φ is finite
whenever Xπi
is finite for each i with 1 i n.
Thus, the type of unconditional commitments associates with a
game and an ordering π of its players the tuple S π1
, . . . , S πn , id ,
