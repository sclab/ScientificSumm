In the introduction, we argued informally how players could 
improve their position by conditionally committing. How well they
can do, could be analyzed by means of an extensive game with the
actions of each player being defined as the possible commitments
he can make. Here, we introduce for each commitment type a 
corresponding notion of extortion, which is defined relative to a 
strategic game and an ordering of the players. Extortions are meant to
capture the concept of a profile that contains, for each player, an 
optimal commitment given the commitments of the players that 
committed earlier. A complicating factor is that in finding a player"s
optimal commitment, one should not only take into account how
such a commitment affects other players" actions, but also how it
enables them to make their commitments.
Definition 4.1. (Extortions) Let G be a strategic game, π an
ordering of its players, and τ a commitment type. Let τ(G, π) be
given by Xπ1
, . . . , Xπn , φ . A τ-extortion of order 0 is any 
commitment profile x ∈ Xπ1
× · · · × Xπn . For m > 0, a commitment
profile x ∈ Xπ1
× · · · × Xπn is a τ-extortion of order m in G given π
if x is an τ-extortion of order m − 1 with
φ yπ1
, . . . , yπm , xπm+1
, . . . , xπn πm φ xπ1
, . . . , xπm , xπm+1
, . . . , xπn
for all commitment profiles g in X with (yπ1
, . . . , yπm , xπm+1
, . . . , xπn )
a τ-extortion of order m − 1. A τ-extortion is a commitment profile
that is a τ-extortion of order m for all m with 0 m n. 
Furthermore, we say that a (mixed) strategy profile σ is τ-extortionable if
there is some τ-extortion x with φ(x) = s.
Thus, an extortion of order 1 is a commitment profile in which
player π1, makes a commitment that maximizes his payoff, given
fixed commitments of the other players. An extortion of order m is
an extortion of order m − 1 that maximizes player m"s payoff, given
fixed commitments of the players πm+1 through πn.
For the type of conditional commitments we have that any 
conditional commitment profile f is an extortion of order 0 and an 
extortion of an order m greater than 0 is any extortion of order m − 1
for which:
gπ1
, . . . , gπm , fπm+1
, . . . , fπn πm fπ1
, . . . , fπm , fπm+1
, . . . , fπn ,
for each conditional commitment profile g such that
gπ1
, . . . , gπm , fπm+1
, . . . , fπn an extortion of order m − 1.
To illustrate the concept of an extortion for conditional 
commitments consider the three-player game in Figure 5 and assume

Figure 6: A conditional extortion f of order 1 (left) and an extortion g of order 3 (right).
(Row, Col, Mat) to be the order in which the players commit. 
Figure 6 depicts the possible conditional commitments of the players
in extensive forms, with the left branch corresponding to Row"s
strategy of playing the top row. Let f and g be the conditional
commitment strategies indicated by the thick lines in the left and
right figures respectively. Both f and g are extortions of order 1.
In both f and g Row guarantees himself the higher payoff given
the conditional commitments of Mat and Col. Only g, however, is
also an extortion of order 2. To appreciate that f is not, consider
the conditional commitment profile h in which Row chooses top
and Col chooses right no matter how Row decides, i.e., h is such
that hRow = t and hCol(t) = hCol(b) = r. Then, (hRow, hCol, fMat) is
also an extortion of order 1, but yields Col a higher payoff than f
does. We leave it to the reader to check that, by contrast, g is an
extortion of order 3, and therewith an extortion per se.
4.1 Promises and Threats
One way of understanding conditional extortions is by 
conceiving of them as combinations of precisely one promise and a 
number of threats. From the strategy profiles that can still be realized
given the conditional commitments of players that have 
committed before him, a player tries to enforce the strategy profile that
yields him as much payoff as possible. Hence, he chooses his 
commitment so as to render deviations from the path that leads to this
strategy profile as unattractive as possible (‘threats") and the 
desired strategy profile as appealing as possible (‘promises") for the
relevant players. If (sπ1
, . . . , sπn ) is such a desirable strategy 
profile for player πi and fπi
his conditional commitment, the value
of fπi
(sπ1
, . . . , sπi−1
) could be taken as his promise, whereas the 
values of fπi
for all other (tπ1
, . . . , tπi−1
) could be seen as constituting
his threats. The higher the payoff is to the other players in a strategy
profile a player aims for, the easier it is for him to formulate an 
effective threat. However, making appropriate threats in this respect
does not merely come down to minimizing the payoffs to players to
commit later wherever possible. A player should also take into 
account the commitments, promises and threats the following players
can make on the basis of his and his predecessors" commitments.
This is what makes extortionate reasoning sometimes so 
complicated, especially in situations with more than two players.
For example, in the game of Figure 5, there is no conditional
extortion that ensures Mat a payoff of two. To appreciate this, 
consider the possible commitments Mat can make in case Row plays
top and Col plays left (tl) and in case Row plays top and Col plays
right (tr). If Mat commits to the right matrix in both cases, he 
virtually promises Row a payoff of four, leaving himself with a payoff of
at most one. Otherwise, he puts Col in a position to deter Row from
choosing bottom by threatening to choose the right column if the
latter does so. Again, Mat cannot expect a payoff higher than one.
In short, no matter how Mat conditionally commits, he will either
enable Col to threaten Row into playing top or fail to lure Row into
playing the bottom row.
4.2 Benign Backward Induction
The solutions extortions provide can also be obtained by 
modeling the situation as an extensive form game and applying a 
backward inductive type of argument. The actions of the players in any
such extensive form game are then given by their conditional 
commitments, which they then choose sequentially. For higher types
of commitment, such as conditional commitments, such 
‘metagames", however, grow exponentially in the number of strategies
available to the players and are generally much larger than the 
original game. The correspondence between the backward induction
solutions in the meta-game and the extortions of the original 
strategic game rather signifies that the concept of an extortion is defined
properly. First we define the concept of benign backward 
induction in general relative to a game in strategic form together with
an ordering of the players. Intuitively it reflects the idea that each
player chooses for each possible combination of actions of his 
predecessors the action that yields the highest payoff, given that his
successors do similarly. The concept is called benign backward 
induction, because it implies that a player, when indifferent between
a number of actions, chooses the one that benefits his 
predecessors most. For an ordering π of the players, we have πR
denote its
reversal (πn, . . . , π1).
Definition 4.2. (Benign backward induction) Let G be a
strategic game and π an ordering of its players. A benign 
backward induction of order 0 is any conditional commitment profile f
subject to π. For m > 0, a conditional commitment strategy 
profile f is a benign backward induction (solution) of order m if f is a
benign backward induction of order m − 1 and
(gπR

, . . . , gπR

, . . . , gπR

) πR
m
(gπR

)
for any backward induction (gπR
n
,..., gπR
m+1
, gπR
m
,..., gπR
1
) of order m−1.
A conditional commitment profile f is a benign backward induction
if it is a benign backward induction of order k for each k with 0
k n.
For games with a finite action set for each player, the 
following result follows straightforwardly from Kuhn"s Theorem (cf. [6,
p. 99]). In particular, this result holds if the players" actions are
commitments of a finite type.
Fact 4.3. For each finite game and each ordering of the 
players, benign backward inductions exist.
For each game, each ordering of its players and each 
commitment type, we can define another game G∗
with the the actions
of each player i given by his τ-commitments Xi in G. The utility
112 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
of a strategy profile (xπ1
, . . . , xπn ) for a player i in G∗
can then be
equated to his utility of the strategy profile φ(xπn , . . . , xπ1
) in G. We
now find that the extortions of G can be retrieved as the paths of
the benign backward induction solutions of the game G∗
for the
ordering πR
of the players, provided that the commitment type is
finite.
Theorem 4.4. Let G = (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N) be a game and π
an ordering of its players with which the finite commitment
type τ associates the tuple Xπ1
, . . . , Xπn , φ . Let further G∗
=
N, (Xπi
)i∈N, (u∗
πi
)i∈N , where u∗
πi
(xπn , . . . , xπ1
) = uπi
(φ(xπ1
, . . . , xπn )),
for each τ-commitment profile (xπ1
, . . . , xπn ). Then, a 
πcommitment profile (xπ1
, . . . , xπn ) is a τ-extortion in G given π if and
only if there is some benign backward induction f in G∗
given πR
with f = (xπn , . . . , xπ1
).
Proof. Assume that f is a benign backward induction in G∗
relative to πR
. Then, f = (xπn , . . . , xπ1
), for some commitment
profile (xπ1
, . . . , xπn ) of G relative to π. We show by induction
that (xπ1
, . . . , xπn ) is an extortion of order m, for all m with 0
m n. For m = 0, the proof is trivial. For the induction step,
consider an arbitrary commitment profile (yπ1
, . . . , yπn ) such that
(yπ1
, . . . , yπm , xπm+1
, . . . , xπn ) is an extortion of order m − 1. In virtue
of the induction hypothesis, there is a benign backward induction g
of order m − 1 in G∗
with g = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1
, yπm , . . . , yπ1
). As f is
also a benign backward induction of order m:
(gπn , . . . , gπ1
) ∗
πm
(gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, fπm , . . . , fπ1
) .
Hence, (xπn , . . . , xπm+1
, yπm , . . . , yπ1
) ∗
πm
(xπn , . . . , xπ1
). By 
definition of u∗
πm
, then also:
φ(yπ1
, . . . , yπm , xπm+1
, . . . , xπn ) πm φ(xπ1
, . . . , xπn ).
We may conclude that x is an extortion of order m.
For the only if direction, assume that x is an extortion of G
given π. We prove that there is a benign backward induction f (∗)
in G∗
for πR
with f (∗)
= x. In virtue of Fact 4.3, there is a benign
backward induction h in G∗
given πR
. Now define f (∗)
in such a way
that f (∗)
πi
(zπn , . . . , zπi−1
) = xπi
, if (zπn , . . . , zπi−1
) = (xπn , . . . , xπi−1
),
and f (∗)
πi
(zπn , . . . , zπi−1
) = hπi
(zπn , . . . , zπi−1
), otherwise. We prove
by induction on m, that f (∗)
is a benign backward induction of
order m, for each m with 0 m n. The basis is trivial. So
assume that f (∗)
is a backward induction of order m − 1 in G∗
given πR
and consider an arbitrary benign backward induction g
of order m − 1 in G∗
given πR
. Let g be given by (yπn , . . . , yπ1
).
Either (yπn , . . . , yπm+1
) = (xπn , . . . , xπm+1
), or this is not the case. If
the latter, it can readily be appreciated that:
(gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, f (∗)
πm
, . . . , f (∗)
π1
) = (gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, hπm , . . . , hπ1
) .
Having assumed that h is a benign backward induction, 
subsequently, (gπn , . . . , gπ1
) ∗
m (gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, hπm , . . . , hπ1
) , and
(gπn , . . . , gπ1
) ∗
m (gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, f (∗)
πm , . . . , f (∗)
π1
) . Hence, f (∗)
is
a benign backward induction of order m. In the former case
the reasoning is slightly different. Then, (gπn , . . . , gπ1
) =
(xπn , . . . , xπm+1
, yπm , . . . , yπ1
). It follows that:
(gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, f (∗)
πm
, . . . , f (∗)
π1
) = (f (∗)
πn
, . . . , f (∗)
π1
) = (xπn , . . . , xπ1
).
In virtue of the induction hypothesis, (yπ1
, . . . , yπn ) is an extortion
of order m − 1 in G given π. As the reasoning takes place under the
assumption that x is an extortion in G given π, we also have:
φ(yπ1
, . . . , yπm , xπm+1
, . . . , xπn ) πm φ(xπ1
, . . . , xπn ).
Then, (xπn , . . . , xπm+1
, yπm , . . . , yπ1
, ) ∗
πm
(xπn , . . . , xπ1
)., by 
definition of u∗
. We may conclude that:
(gπn , . . . , gπ1
) ∗
πm
(gπn , . . . , gπm+1
, f (∗)
πm
, . . . , f (∗)
π1
) ,
signifying that f (∗)
is a benign backward induction of order m.
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.4 and Fact 4.3 we also
have the following result.
Corollary 4.5. Let τ be a finite commitment type. Then,
τ-extortions exist for each strategic game and for each ordering
of the players.
4.3 Commitment Order
In the case of unconditional commitments, it is not always 
favorable to be the first to commit. This is well illustrated by the familiar
game rock-paper-scissors. If, on the other hand, the players are in a
position to make conditional commitments in this particular game,
moving first is an advantage. Rather, we find that it can never harm
to move first in a two-player game with conditional commitments.
Theorem 4.6. Let G be a two-player strategic game involving
player i. Further let f be an extortion of G in which i commits first,
and g an extortion in which i commits second. Then, g i f .
Proof sketch. Let f be a conditional extortion in G given π. It
suffices to show that there is some conditional extortion h of 
order 1 in G given π with h = f . Assume for a contradiction that
there is no such extortion of order 1 in G given π . Then there must
be some b∗
∈ Aj such that f ≺j b∗
, a , for all a ∈ Ai. 
(Otherwise we could define (gj, gi) such that gj = fj(fi), gi(gj) = fi,
and for any other b ∈ Aj, gi(b) = a∗
, where a∗
is an action in Ai
such that (b, a∗
) j f . Then g would be an extortion of order 1
in G given π with g .) Now consider a conditional commitment
profile h for G and π such that hj(a) = b∗
, for all a ∈ Ai. Let 
further hi be such that (a, hj) i (hi, hj) , for all a ∈ Ai. Then, h is an
extortion of order 1 in G given π. Observe that (hi, hj) = (fi , b∗
).
Hence, f ≺j h , contradicting the assumption that f is an extortion
in G given π.
Theorem 4.6 does not generalize to games with more than two
players. Consider the three-player game in Figure 7, with 
extensive forms as in Figure 8. Here, Row and Mat have identical 
preferences. The latter"s extortionate powers relative Col, however, are
very weak if he is to commit first: any conditional commitment
he makes puts Col in a situation in which she can enforce a 
payoff of two, leaving Mat and Row in the cold with a payoff of one.
However, if Mat is last to commit and Row first, then the latter can
exploit his strategic powers, threaten Col so that she plays left, and
guarantee both himself and Mat a payoff of two.
4.4 Pareto Efficiency
Another issue concerns the Pareto efficiency of the strategy 
profiles extortionable through conditional commitments. We say that
a strategy profile s (weakly) Pareto dominates another strategy 
profile t if t i s for all players i and s it for some. Moreover, a
strategy profile s is (weakly) Pareto efficient if it is not (weakly)
Pareto dominated by any other strategy profile. We extend this
terminology to conditional commitment profiles by saying that a
conditional commitment profile f is (weakly) Pareto efficient or
(weakly) Pareto dominates another conditional commitment profile
if f is or does so. We now have the following result.

Theorem 4.7. In each game, Pareto efficient conditional 
extortions exist. Moreover, any strategy profile that Pareto dominates an
extortion is also extortionable through a conditional commitment.
Proof sketch. Since, in virtue of Fact 4.5, extortions 
generally exists in each game, it suffices to recognize that the second
claim holds. Let s be the strategy profile (sπ1
, . . . , sπn ). Let 
further the conditional extortion f be Pareto dominated by s. An
extortion g with g = s can then be constructed by adopting
all threats of f while promising g . I.e., for all players πi we
have gπi
(sπ1
, . . . , sπi−1
) = si and gπi
(tπ1
, . . . , tπn ) = fπi
(tπ1
, . . . , tπn ),
for all other tπ1
, . . . , tπn . As s Pareto dominates f , the threats of f
remain effective as threats of g given that s is being promised.
This result hints at a difference between (benign) backward 
induction and extortions. In general, solutions of benign backward
inductions can be Pareto dominated by outcomes that are no benign
backward induction solutions. Therefore, although every extortion
can be seen as a benign backward induction in a larger game, it is
not the case that all formal properties of extortions are shared by
benign backward inductions in general.
