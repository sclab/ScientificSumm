Conditional and unconditional commitments are only two 
possible commitment types. The definition also provides for types
of commitment that allow for committing on commitments, thus
achieving a finer adjustment of promises and threats. Similarly, it
subsumes commitments on and to mixed strategies. In this section
we comment on some of these possibilities.
5.1 Inductive Commitments
Apart from making commitments conditional on the actions of
the players to commit later, one could also commit on the 
commitments of the following players. Informally, such commitments
would have the form of if you only dare to commit in such and
such a way, then I do such and such, otherwise I promise to act so
and so.
For a strategic game G and an ordering π of the players, we 
define the inductive commitments of the players inductively. The 
inductive commitments available to π1 coincide with the actions that
are available to him. An inductive commitment for player πi+1 is a
function mapping each profile of inductive commitments of 
players π1 through πi to one of his basic actions. Formally we define the
type of inductive commitments Fπ1
, . . . , Fπn , such that for each
player πi in a game G and given π:
Fπ1
=df. Aπ1
,
Fπi+1
=df. A
Fπ1 ×···×Fπi
πi+1
.
Let fπi
= fπi
fπ1
, . . . , fπi−1
, for each player πi and have f denote
the pure strategy profile fπ1
, . . . , fπn
.
Inductive commitments have a greater extortionate power than
conditional commitments. To appreciate this, consider once more
the game in Figure 5. We found that the strategy profile in
which Row chooses bottom and Col and Mat both choose left is
not extortionable through conditional commitments. By means of
inductive commitments, however, this is possible. Let f be the
inductive commitment profile such that fRow is Row choosing the
bottom row (b), fCol is the column player choosing the left column
(l) no matter how Row decides, and fMat is defined such that:
fMat fRow, fCol =
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
r if fRow = t and fCol (b) = r,
l otherwise.
Instead of showing formally that f is an inductive extortion of the
strategy profile (b, l, l), we point out informally how this can be
done. We argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of
a conditional extortion, Mat would have to lure Row into choosing
the bottom row without at the same time putting Col in a position
to successfully threaten Row not to choose top. This, we found,
is an impossibility if the players can only make conditional 
commitments. By contrast, if Mat can commit to commitments, he can
undermine Col"s efforts to threaten Row by playing the right 
matrix, if Col were to do so. Yet, Mat can still force Row to choose
the bottom row, in case Col desists form making this threat.
As can readily be observed, in any game, the inductive 
commitments of the first two players to commit coincide with their
conditional commitments. Hence, as an immediate consequence
of Theorem 4.6, it can never harm to be the first to commit to
an inductive commitment in the two player case. Similarly, we
find that the game depicted in Figure 7 also serves as an example
showing that, in case there are more than two players, it is not 
always better to commit to an inductive commitment early. In this
example the strategic position of Mat is so weak if he is to 
commit first, that even the possibility to commit inductively does not
strengthen it, whereas, in a similar fashion as with conditional 
commitments, Row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and Mat
if he is the first to commit.
5.2 Mixed Commitments Types
So far we have merely considered commitments to and on pure
strategies. A natural extension would be also to consider 
commitments to and on mixed strategies. We distinguish between 
conditional, unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments.
We find that they are generally quite incomparable with their pure
counterparts: in some situations a player can achieve more using
a mixed commitment, in another using a pure commitment type.
A complicating factor with mixed commitment types is that they
114 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
can result in a mixed strategy profile being played. This makes
that the distinction between promises and threats, as delineated in
Section 4.1, gets blurred for mixed commitment types.
The type of mixed unconditional commitments associates
with each game G and ordering π of its players the 
tuple Σπ1
, . . . , Σπn , id . The two-player case has been extensively
studied (e.g., [2, 16]). As a matter of fact, von Neumann"s 
famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games,
it does not matter which player commits first. If the second player
to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level, the
first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14].
In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional 
commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a 
payoff of two. Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to
deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col
in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom
row. If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however,
this is a possibility. We now find that in case the players can 
dispose of unconditional mixed strategies, Mat is in a much similar
position. He could randomize uniformly between the left and right
matrix. Then, Row"s expected utility is 21
2
if he plays the top row,
no matter how Col randomizes. The expected payoff of Col does
not exceed 21
2
, either, in case Row chooses top. By purely 
committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom,
as his expected utility then amounts to 3. This ensures an expected
utility of three for Col as well.
However, a player is not always better off with unconditional
mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments. For
an example, consider the game in Figure 2. Using pure conditional
commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with 
unconditional mixed commitments 21
2
would be the most he could
achieve. Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a
mixed strategy in a three-player game. To appreciate this, consider
once more the game in Figure 7. Again committing to a mixed
strategy will not achieve much for Mat if he is to move first, and as
before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other
than a pure strategy. This holds for all players if Row commits first,
Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best
payoff he can get.
Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can
also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive 
commitments. With the former, a player can condition his mixed 
strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him.
These tend to be very large objects and, knowing little about them
yet, we shelve their formal analysis for future research. 
Conceptually, it might not be immediately clear how such mixed conditional
commitments can be made with credibility. For one, when one"s
commitments are conditional on a particular mixed strategy being
played, how can it be recognized that it was in fact this mixed 
strategy that was played rather than another one? If this proves to be
impossible, how can one know how his conditional commitments
is to be effectuated? A possible answer would be, that all depends
on the circumstances in which the commitments were made. E.g.,
if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional 
commitments to an independent party, the latter can execute the 
randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their
commitments induce.
