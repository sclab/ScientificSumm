In some situations agents can strengthen their strategic position
by committing themselves to a particular course of action. There
are various types of commitment, e.g., pure, mixed and conditional.
Which type of commitment an agent is in a position in to make 
essentially depends on the situation under consideration. If the agents
commit in a particular order, there is a tactic common to making
commitments of any type, which we have formalized by means the
concept of an extortion. This generic concept of extortion can be
analyzed in abstracto. Moreover, on its basis the various 
commitment types can be compared formally and systematically.
We have seen that the type of commitment an agent can make
has a profound impact on what an agent can achieve in a 
gamelike situation. In some situations a player is much helped if he
is in a position to commit conditionally, whereas in others mixed
commitments would be more profitable. This raises the question
as to the characteristic formal features of the situations in which it
is advantageous for a player to be able to make commitments of a
particular type.
Another issue which we leave for future research is the 
computational complexity of finding an extortion for the different 
commitment types.
