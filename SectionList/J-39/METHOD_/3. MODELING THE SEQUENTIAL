AUCTION PROBLEM
While the eBay analysis was for simple bidders who 
desire only a single item, let us now consider a more general
scenario where people may desire multiple goods of different
types, possessing general valuations over those goods.
Consider a world with buyers (sometimes called bidders)
B and K different types of goods G1...GK . Let T = {0, 1, ...}
denote time periods. Let L denote a bundle of goods, 
represented as a vector of size K, where Lk ∈ {0, 1} denotes
the quantity of good type Gk in the bundle.8
The type of a
buyer i ∈ B is (ai, di, vi), with arrival time ai ∈ T, departure
time di ∈ T, and private valuation vi(L) ≥ 0 for each bundle
of goods L received between ai and di, and zero value 
otherwise. The arrival time models the period in which a buyer
first realizes her demand and enters the market, while the
departure time models the period in which a buyer loses 
interest in acquiring the good(s). In settings with general 
valuations, we need an additional assumption: an upper bound
on the difference between a buyer"s arrival and departure,
denoted ΔMax. Buyers have quasi-linear utilities, so that
the utility of buyer i receiving bundle L and paying p, in
some period no later than di, is ui(L, p) = vi(L) − p. Each
seller j ∈ S brings a single item kj to the market, has no
intrinsic value and wants to maximize revenue. Seller j has
an arrival time, aj, which models the period in which she
is first interested in listing the item, while the departure
time, dj, models the latest period in which she is willing to
consider having an auction for the item close. A seller will
receive payment by the end of the reported departure of the
winning buyer.

We extend notation whereby a single item k of type Gk
refers to a vector L : Lk = 1.

We say an individual auction in a sequence is locally 
strategyproof (LSP) if truthful bidding is a dominant strategy
for a buyer that can only bid in that auction. Consider the
following example to see that LSP is insufficient for the 
existence of a dominant bidding strategy for buyers facing a
sequence of auctions.
Example 1. Alice values one ton of Sand with one ton
of Stone at $2, 000. Bob holds a Vickrey auction for one ton
of Sand on Monday and a Vickrey auction for one ton of
Stone on Tuesday. Alice has no dominant bidding strategy
because she needs to know the price for Stone on Tuesday to
know her maximum willingness to pay for Sand on Monday.
Definition 1. The sequential auction problem. Given
a sequence of auctions, despite each auction being locally
strategyproof, a bidder has no dominant bidding strategy.
Consider a sequence of auctions. Generally, auctions 
selling the same item will be uncertainly-ordered, because a
buyer will not know the ordering of closing prices among
the auctions. Define the interesting bundles for a buyer as
all bundles that could maximize the buyer"s profit for some
combination of auctions and bids of other buyers.9
Within
the interesting bundles, say that an item has uncertain 
marginal value if the marginal value of an item depends on the
other goods held by the buyer.10
Say that an item is 
oversupplied if there is more than one auction offering an item
of that type. Say two bundles are substitutes if one of those
bundles has the same value as the union of both bundles.11
Proposition 1. Given locally strategyproof single-item
auctions, the sequential auction problem exists for a bidder if
and only if either of the following two conditions is true: (1)
within the set of interesting bundles (a) there are two 
bundles that are substitutes, (b) there is an item with uncertain
marginal value, or (c) there is an item that is over-supplied;
(2) a bidder faces competitors" bids that are conditioned on
the bidder"s past bids.
Proof. (Sketch.)(⇐) A bidder does not have a dominant
strategy when (a) she does not know which bundle among
substitutes to pursue, (b) she faces the exposure problem,
or (c) she faces the multiple copies problem. Additionally,
a bidder does not have a dominant strategy when she does
not how to optimally influence the bids of competitors.(⇒)
By contradiction. A bidder has a dominant strategy to bid
its constant marginal value for a given item in each auction
available when conditions (1) and (2) are both false.
For example, the following buyers all face the sequential
auction problem as a result of condition (a), (b) and (c)
respectively: a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000,
or one ton of Stone for $2,000, but not both Sand and Stone;
a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000, one ton of
Stone for $300, and one ton of Sand and one ton of Stone for
$1,500, and can participate in an auction for Sand before an
auction for Stone; a buyer who values one ton of Sand for
$1,000 and can participate in many auctions selling Sand.

Assume that the empty set is an interesting bundle.

Formally, an item k has uncertain marginal value if |{m :
m = vi(Q) − vi(Q − k), ∀Q ⊆ L ∈ InterestingBundle, Q ⊇
k}| > 1.
11
Formally, two bundles A and B are substitutes if vi(A ∪
B) = max(vi(A), vi(B)), where A ∪ B = L where Lk =
max(Ak, Bk).
