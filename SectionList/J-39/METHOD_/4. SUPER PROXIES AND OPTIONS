The novel solution proposed in this work to resolve the
sequential auction problem consists of two primary 
components: richer proxy agents, and options with price matching.
In finance, a real option is a right to acquire a real good at
a certain price, called the exercise price. For instance, Alice
may obtain from Bob the right to buy Sand from him at
an exercise price of $1, 000. An option provides the right to
purchase a good at an exercise price but not the obligation.
This flexibility allows buyers to put together a collection of
options on goods and then decide which to exercise.
Options are typically sold at a price called the option
price. However, options obtained at a non-zero option price
cannot generally support a simple, dominant bidding 
strategy, as a buyer must compute the expected value of an 
option to justify the cost [8]. This computation requires a
model of the future, which in our setting requires a model
of the bidding strategies and the values of other bidders.
This is the very kind of game-theoretic reasoning that we
want to avoid.
Instead, we consider costless options with an option price
of zero. This will require some care as buyers are weakly
better off with a costless option than without one, whatever
its exercise price. However, multiple bidders pursuing 
options with no intention of exercising them would cause the
efficiency of an auction for options to unravel. This is the
role of the mandatory proxy agents, which intermediate
between buyers and the market. A proxy agent forces a link
between the valuation function used to acquire options and
the valuation used to exercise options. If a buyer tells her
proxy an inflated value for an item, she runs the risk of 
having the proxy exercise options at a price greater than her
value.
4.1 Buyer Proxies
4.1.1 Acquiring Options
After her arrival, a buyer submits her valuation ˆvi 
(perhaps untruthfully) to her proxy in some period ˆai ≥ ai,
along with a claim about her departure time ˆdi ≥ ˆai. All
transactions are intermediated via proxy agents. Each 
auction is modified to sell an option on that good to the 
highest bidding proxy, with an initial exercise price set to the
second-highest bid received.12
When an option in which a buyer is interested becomes
available for the first time, the proxy determines its bid
by computing the buyer"s maximum marginal value for the
item, and then submits a bid in this amount. A proxy does
not bid for an item when it already holds an option. The
bid price is:
bidt
i(k) = max
L
[ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)] (1)
By having a proxy compute a buyer"s maximum marginal
value for an item and then bidding only that amount, a
buyer"s proxy will win any auction that could possibly be of
benefit to the buyer and only lose those auctions that could
never be of value to the buyer.
12
The system can set a reserve price for each good, provided
that the reserve is universal for all auctions selling the same
item. Without a universal reserve price, price matching is
not possible because of the additional restrictions on prices
that individual sellers will accept.

-Table 1: Three-buyer example with each wanting a 
single item and one auction occurring on Monday and 
Tuesday. XY  implies an option with exercise price X and
bookkeeping that a proxy has prevented Y from 
currently possessing an option. → is the updating of 
exercise price and bookkeeping.
When a proxy wins an auction for an option, the proxy
will store in its local memory the identity (which may be
a pseudonym) of the proxy not holding an option because
of the proxy"s win (i.e., the proxy that it ‘bumped" from
winning, if any). This information will be used for price
matching.
4.1.2 Pricing Options
Sellers agree by joining the market to allow the proxy
representing a buyer to adjust the exercise price of an option
that it holds downwards if the proxy discovers that it could
have achieved a better price by waiting to bid in a later
auction for an option on the same good. To assist in the
implementation of the price matching scheme each proxy
tracks future auctions for an option that it has already won
and will determine who would be bidding in that auction
had the proxy delayed its entry into the market until this
later auction. The proxy will request price matching from
the seller that granted it an option if the proxy discovers that
it could have secured a lower price by waiting. To reiterate,
the proxy does not acquire more than one option for any
good. Rather, it reduces the exercise price on its already
issued option if a better deal is found.
The proxy is able to discover these deals by asking each
future auction to report the identities of the bidders in that
auction together with their bids. This needs to be enforced
by eBay, as the central authority. The highest bidder in this
later auction, across those whose identity is not stored in
the proxy"s memory for the given item, is exactly the bidder
against whom the proxy would be competing had it delayed
its entry until this auction. If this high bid is lower than the
current option price held, the proxy price matches down
to this high bid price.
After price matching, one of two adjustments will be made
by the proxy for bookkeeping purposes. If the winner of
the auction is the bidder whose identity has been in the
proxy"s local memory, the proxy will replace that local 
information with the identity of the bidder whose bid it just
price matched, as that is now the bidder the proxy has 
prevented from obtaining an option. If the auction winner"s
identity is not stored in the proxy"s local memory the 
memory may be cleared. In this case, the proxy will simply price
match against the bids of future auction winners on this
item until the proxy departs.
Example 2 (Table 1). Molly"s proxy wins the 
Monday auction, submitting a bid of $8 and receiving an option
for $6. Molly"s proxy adds Nancy to its local memory as
Nancy"s proxy would have won had Molly"s proxy not bid.

proxy holds an option), with Nancy"s proxy winning an

tion for $4 and noting that it bumped Polly"s proxy. At this
time, Molly"s proxy will price match its option down to $4
and replace Nancy with Polly in its local memory as per the
price match algorithm, as Polly would be holding an option
had Molly never bid.
4.1.3 Exercising Options
At the reported departure time the proxy chooses which
options to exercise. Therefore, a seller of an option must
wait until period ˆdw for the option to be exercised and 
receive payment, where w was the winner of the option.13
For
bidder i, in period ˆdi, the proxy chooses the option(s) that
maximize the (reported) utility of the buyer:
θ∗
t = argmax
θ⊆Θ
(ˆvi(γ(θ)) − π(θ)) (2)
where Θ is the set of all options held, γ(θ) are the goods
corresponding to a set of options, and π(θ) is the sum of
exercise prices for a set of options. All other options are
returned.14
No options are exercised when no combination
of options have positive utility.
4.1.4 Why bookkeep and not match winning price?
One may believe that an alternative method for 
implementing a price matching scheme could be to simply have
proxies match the lowest winning price they observe after
winning an option. However, as demonstrated in Table 2,
such a simple price matching scheme will not lead to a 
truthful system.
The first scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome
if all agents were to truthfully report their types. Molly
13
While this appears restrictive on the seller, we believe it not
significantly different than what sellers on eBay currently
endure in practice. An auction on eBay closes at a specific
time, but a seller must wait until a buyer relinquishes 
payment before being able to realize the revenue, an amount of
time that could easily be days (if payment is via a money
order sent through courier) to much longer (if a buyer is
slow but not overtly delinquent in remitting her payment).
14
Presumably, an option returned will result in the seller
holding a new auction for an option on the item it still
possesses. However, the system will not allow a seller to
re-auction an option until ΔMax after the option had first
been issued in order to maintain a truthful mechanism.

would win the Monday auction and receive an option with
an exercise price of $6 (subsequently exercising that option
at the end of Monday), and Nancy would win the Tuesday
auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $4
(subsequently exercising that option at the end of Tuesday).
The second scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome
if Nancy were to misreport her value for the good by 
reporting an inflated value of $10, using the proposed bookkeeping
method. Nancy would win the Monday auction and receive
an option with an exercise price of $8. On Tuesday, Polly
would win the auction and receive an option with an exercise
price of $0. Nancy"s proxy would observe that the highest
bid submitted on Tuesday among those proxies not stored
in local memory is Polly"s bid of $4, and so Nancy"s proxy
would price match the exercise price of its option down to
$4. Note that the exercise price Nancy"s proxy has obtained
at the end of Tuesday is the same as when she truthfully
revealed her type to her proxy.
The third scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome if
Nancy were to misreport her value for the good by reporting
an inflated value of $10, if the price matching scheme were
for proxies to simply match their option price to the 
lowest winning price at any time while they are in the system.
Nancy would win the Monday auction and receive an option
with an exercise price of $8. On Tuesday, Polly would win
the auction and receive an option with an exercise price of
$0. Nancy"s proxy would observe that the lowest price on
Tuesday was $0, and so Nancy"s proxy would price match
the exercise price of its option down to $0. Note that the
exercise price Nancy"s proxy has obtained at the end of 
Tuesday is lower than when she truthfully revealed her type to
the proxy.
Therefore, a price matching policy of simply matching the
lowest price paid may not elicit truthful information from
buyers.
4.2 Complexity of Algorithm
An XOR-valuation of size M for buyer i is a set of M
terms, < L1
, v1
i > ...< LM
, vM
i >, that maps distinct 
bundles to values, where i is interested in acquiring at most one
such bundle. For any bundle S, vi(S) = maxLm⊆S(vm
i ).
Theorem 1. Given an XOR-valuation which possesses
M terms, there is an O(KM2
) algorithm for computing all
maximum marginal values, where K is the number of 
different item types in which a buyer may be interested.
Proof. For each item type, recall Equation 1 which 
defines the maximum marginal value of an item. For each
bundle L in the M-term valuation, vi(L + k) may be found
by iterating over the M terms. Therefore, the number of
terms explored to determine the maximum marginal value
for any item is O(M2
), and so the total number of 
bundle comparisons to be performed to calculate all maximum
marginal values is O(KM2
).
Theorem 2. The total memory required by a proxy for
implementing price matching is O(K), where K is the 
number of distinct item types. The total work performed by a
proxy to conduct price matching in each auction is O(1).
Proof. By construction of the algorithm, the proxy stores
one maximum marginal value for each item for bidding, of
which there are O(K); at most one buyer"s identity for each
item, of which there are O(K); and one current option 
exercise price for each item, of which there are O(K). For
each auction, the proxy either submits a precomputed bid
or price matches, both of which take O(1) work.
4.3 Truthful Bidding to the Proxy Agent
Proxies transform the market into a direct revelation 
mechanism, where each buyer i interacts with the proxy only
once,15
and does so by declaring a bid, bi, which is 
defined as an announcement of her type, (ˆai, ˆdi, ˆvi), where
the announcement may or may not be truthful. We 
denote all received bids other than i"s as b−i. Given bids,
b = (bi, b−i), the market determines allocations, xi(b), and
payments, pi(b) ≥ 0, to each buyer (using an online 
algorithm).
A dominant strategy equilibrium for buyers requires that
vi(xi(bi, b−i))−pi(bi, b−i) ≥ vi(xi(bi, b−i))−pi(bi, b−i), ∀bi =
bi, ∀b−i.
We now establish that it is a dominant strategy for a buyer
to reveal her true valuation and true departure time to her
proxy agent immediately upon arrival to the system. The
proof builds on the price-based characterization of 
strategyproof single-item online auctions in Hajiaghayi et al. [12].
Define a monotonic and value-independent price function
psi(ai, di, L, v−i) which can depend on the values of other
agents v−i. Price psi(ai, di, L, v−i) will represent the price
available to agent i for bundle L in the mechanism if it
announces arrival time ai and departure time di. The price
is independent of the value vi of agent i, but can depend on
ai, di and L as long as it satisfies a monotonicity condition.
Definition 2. Price function psi(ai, di, L, v−i) is 
monotonic if psi(ai, di, L , v−i) ≤ psi(ai, di, L, v−i) for all ai ≤
ai, all di ≥ di, all bundles L ⊆ L and all v−i.
Lemma 1. An online combinatorial auction will be 
strategyproof (with truthful reports of arrival, departure and value
a dominant strategy) when there exists a monotonic and
value-independent price function, psi(ai, di, L, v−i), such that
for all i and all ai, di ∈ T and all vi, agent i is allocated 
bundle L∗
= argmaxL [vi(L) − psi(ai, di, L, v−i)] in period di
and makes payment psi(ai, di, L∗
, v−i).
Proof. Agent i cannot benefit from reporting a later 
departure ˆdi because the allocation is made in period ˆdi and
the agent would have no value for this allocation. Agent
i cannot benefit from reporting a later arrival ˆai ≥ ai or
earlier departure ˆdi ≤ di because of price monotonicity. 
Finally, the agent cannot benefit from reporting some ˆvi = vi
because its reported valuation does not change the prices
it faces and the mechanism maximizes its utility given its
reported valuation and given the prices.
Lemma 2. At any given time, there is at most one buyer
in the system whose proxy does not hold an option for a
given item type because of buyer i"s presence in the system,
and the identity of that buyer will be stored in i"s proxy"s
local memory at that time if such a buyer exists.
Proof. By induction. Consider the first proxy that a
buyer prevents from winning an option. Either (a) the
15
For analysis purposes, we view the mechanism as an opaque
market so that the buyer cannot condition her bid on bids
placed by others.
185
bumped proxy will leave the system having never won an
option, or (b) the bumped proxy will win an auction in the
future. If (a), the buyer"s presence prevented exactly that
one buyer from winning an option, but will have not 
prevented any other proxies from winning an option (as the
buyer"s proxy will not bid on additional options upon 
securing one), and will have had that bumped proxy"s identity
in its local memory by definition of the algorithm. If (b),
the buyer has not prevented the bumped proxy from 
winning an option after all, but rather has prevented only the
proxy that lost to the bumped proxy from winning (if any),
whose identity will now be stored in the proxy"s local 
memory by definition of the algorithm. For this new identity in
the buyer"s proxy"s local memory, either scenario (a) or (b)
will be true, ad infinitum.
Given this, we show that the options-based 
infrastructure implements a price-based auction with a monotonic and
value-independent price schedule to every agent.
Theorem 3. Truthful revelation of valuation, arrival and
departure is a dominant strategy for a buyer in the 
optionsbased market.
Proof. First, define a simple agent-independent price
function pk
i (t, v−i) as the highest bid by the proxies not
holding an option on an item of type Gk at time t, not
including the proxy representing i herself and not 
including any proxies that would have already won an option had
i never entered the system (i.e., whose identity is stored
in i"s proxy"s local memory)(∞ if no supply at t). This
set of proxies is independent of any declaration i makes to
its proxy (as the set explicitly excludes the at most one
proxy (see Lemma 2) that i has prevented from holding
an option), and each bid submitted by a proxy within this
set is only a function of their own buyer"s declared 
valuation (see Equation 1). Furthermore, i cannot influence
the supply she faces as any options returned by bidders
due to a price set by i"s proxy"s bid will be re-auctioned
after i has departed the system. Therefore, pk
i (t, v−i) is
independent of i"s declaration to its proxy. Next, define
psk
i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) = minˆai≤τ≤ ˆdi
[pk
i (τ, v−i)] (possibly ∞) as the
minimum price over pk
i (t, v−i), which is clearly monotonic.
By construction of price matching, this is exactly the price
obtained by a proxy on any option that it holds at 
departure. Define psi(ˆai, ˆdi, L, v−i) =
Èk=K
k=1 psk
i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i)Lk,
which is monotonic in ˆai, ˆdi and L since psk
i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) is
monotonic in ˆai and ˆdi and (weakly) greater than zero for
each k. Given the set of options held at ˆdi, which may be
a subset of those items with non-infinite prices, the proxy
exercises options to maximize the reported utility. Left to
show is that all bundles that could not be obtained with
options held are priced sufficiently high as to not be 
preferred. For each such bundle, either there is an item priced
at ∞ (in which case the bundle would not be desired) or
there must be an item in that bundle for which the proxy
does not hold an option that was available. In all auctions
for such an item there must have been a distinct bidder
with a bid greater than bidt
i(k), which subsequently results
in psk
i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) > bidt
i(k), and so the bundle without k
would be preferred to the bundle.
Theorem 4. The super proxy, options-based scheme is
individually-rational for both buyers and sellers.

prices paid, average bidder value among winners, and

LCD screens as well as the simulated options-based 
market using worst-case estimates of bidders" true value.
Proof. By construction, the proxy exercises the profit
maximizing set of options obtained, or no options if no set
of options derives non-negative surplus. Therefore, buyers
are guaranteed non-negative surplus by participating in the
scheme. For sellers, the price of each option is based on a
non-negative bid or zero.
