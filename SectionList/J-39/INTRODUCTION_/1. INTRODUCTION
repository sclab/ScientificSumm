Electronic markets represent an application of information
systems that has generated significant new trading 
opportunities while allowing for the dynamic pricing of goods. In 
addition to marketplaces such as eBay, electronic marketplaces
are increasingly used for business-to-consumer auctions (e.g.
to sell surplus inventory [19]).
Many authors have written about a future in which 
commerce is mediated by online, automated trading agents [10,
25, 1]. There is still little evidence of automated trading
in e-markets, though. We believe that one leading place of
resistance is in the lack of provably optimal bidding 
strategies for any but the simplest of market designs. Without
this, we do not expect individual consumers, or firms, to
be confident in placing their business in the hands of an
automated agent.
One of the most common examples today of an electronic
marketplace is eBay, where the gross merchandise volume
(i.e., the sum of all successfully closed listings) during 2005
was $44B. Among items listed on eBay, many are essentially
identical. This is especially true in the Consumer 
Electronics category [9], which accounted for roughly $3.5B of eBay"s
gross merchandise volume in 2005. This presence of 
essentially identical items can expose bidders, and sellers, to risks
because of the sequential auction problem.
For example, Alice may want an LCD monitor, and could
potentially bid in either a 1 o"clock or 3 o"clock eBay 
auction. While Alice would prefer to participate in whichever
auction will have the lower winning price, she cannot 
determine beforehand which auction that may be, and could
end up winning the wrong auction. This is a problem of
multiple copies.
Another problem bidders may face is the exposure 
problem. As investigated by Bykowsky et al. [6], exposure 
problems exist when buyers desire a bundle of goods but may
only participate in single-item auctions.1
For example, if
Alice values a video game console by itself for $200, a video
game by itself for $30, and both a console and game for $250,
Alice must determine how much of the $20 of synergy value
she might include in her bid for the console alone. Both
problems arise in eBay as a result of sequential auctions of
single items coupled with patient bidders with substitutes
or complementary valuations.
Why might the sequential auction problem be bad? 
Complex games may lead to bidders employing costly strategies
and making mistakes. Potential bidders who do not wish
to bear such costs may choose not to participate in the

auctions. The problem is also a familiar one of online 
decision making.

market, inhibiting seller revenue opportunities. 
Additionally, among those bidders who do choose to participate, the
mistakes made may lead to inefficient allocations, further
limiting revenue opportunities.
We are interested in creating modifications to eBay-style
markets that simplify the bidder problem, leading to simple
equilibrium strategies, and preferably better efficiency and
revenue properties.
1.1 Options + Proxies: A Proposed Solution
Retail stores have developed policies to assist their 
customers in addressing sequential purchasing problems. 
Return policies alleviate the exposure problem by allowing 
customers to return goods at the purchase price. Price 
matching alleviates the multiple copies problem by allowing buyers
to receive from sellers after purchase the difference between
the price paid for a good and a lower price found elsewhere
for the same good [7, 15, 18]. Furthermore, price matching
can reduce the impact of exactly when a seller brings an
item to market, as the price will in part be set by others
selling the same item. These two retail policies provide the
basis for the scheme proposed in this paper.2
We extend the proxy bidding technology currently 
employed by eBay. Our super-proxy extension will take 
advantage of a new, real options-based, market infrastructure
that enables simple, yet optimal, bidding strategies. The
extensions are computationally simple, handle temporal 
issues, and retain seller autonomy in deciding when to enter
the market and conduct individual auctions.
A seller sells an option for a good, which will ultimately
lead to either a sale of the good or the return of the option.
Buyers interact through a proxy agent, defining a value on
all possible bundles of goods in which they have interest
together with the latest time period in which they are 
willing to wait to receive the good(s). The proxy agents use
this information to determine how much to bid for options,
and follow a dominant bidding strategy across all relevant
auctions. A proxy agent exercises options held when the
buyer"s patience has expired, choosing options that 
maximize a buyer"s payoff given the reported valuation. All other
options are returned to the market and not exercised. The
options-based protocol makes truthful and immediate 
revelation to a proxy a dominant strategy for buyers, whatever
the future auction dynamics.
We conduct an empirical analysis of eBay, collecting data
on over four months of bids for Dell LCD screens (model
E193FP) starting in the Summer of 2005. LCD screens are
a high-ticket item, for which we demonstrate evidence of
the sequential bidding problem. We first infer a 
conservative model for the arrival time, departure time and value of
bidders on eBay for LCD screens during this period. This
model is used to simulate the performance of the 
optionsbased infrastructure, in order to make direct comparisons to
the actual performance of eBay in this market.
We also extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to 
estimate an upper bound on the distribution of value of eBay
bidders, taking into account the sequential auction 
problem when making the adjustments. Using this estimate, one
can approximate how much greater a bidder"s true value is

Prior work has shown price matching as a potential 
mechanism for colluding firms to set monopoly prices. However,
in our context, auction prices will be matched, which are
not explicitly set by sellers but rather by buyers" bids.
from the maximum bid they were observed to have placed
on eBay. Based on this approximation, revenue generated
in a simulation of the options-based scheme exceeds 
revenue on eBay for the comparable population and sequence of
auctions by 14.8%, while the options-based scheme 
demonstrates itself as being 7.5% more efficient.
1.2 Related Work
A number of authors [27, 13, 28, 29] have analyzed the
multiple copies problem, often times in the context of 
categorizing or modeling sniping behavior for reasons other
than those first brought forward by Ockenfels and Roth
[20]. These papers perform equilibrium analysis in simpler
settings, assuming bidders can participate in at most two
auctions. Peters & Severinov [21] extend these models to 
allow buyers to consider an arbitrary number of auctions, and
characterize a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. However, their
model does not allow auctions to close at distinct times and
does not consider the arrival and departure of bidders.
Previous work have developed a data-driven approach 
toward developing a taxonomy of strategies employed by 
bidders in practice when facing multi-unit auctions, but have
not considered the sequential bidding problem [26, 2]. 
Previous work has also sought to provide agents with smarter
bidding strategies [4, 3, 5, 1]. Unfortunately, it seems hard
to design artificial agents with equilibrium bidding 
strategies, even for a simple simultaneous ascending price auction.
Iwasaki et al. [14] have considered the role of options in
the context of a single, monolithic, auction design to help
bidders with marginal-increasing values avoid exposure in
a multi-unit, homogeneous item auction problem. In other
contexts, options have been discussed for selling coal mine
leases [23], or as leveled commitment contracts for use in a
decentralized market place [24]. Most similar to our work,
Gopal et al. [9] use options for reducing the risks of buyers
and sellers in the sequential auction problem. However, their
work uses costly options and does not remove the sequential
bidding problem completely.
Work on online mechanisms and online auctions [17, 12,
22] considers agents that can dynamically arrive and depart
across time. We leverage a recent price-based 
characterization by Hajiaghayi et al. [12] to provide a dominant strategy
equilibrium for buyers within our options-based protocol.
The special case for single-unit buyers is equivalent to the
protocol of Hajiaghayi et al., albeit with an options-based
interpretation.
Jiang and Leyton-Brown [16] use machine learning 
techniques for bid identification in online auctions.
