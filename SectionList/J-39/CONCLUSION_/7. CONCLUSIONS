We introduced a new sales channel, consisting of an 
optionsbased and proxied auction protocol, to address the 
sequential auction problem that exists when bidders face 
multiple auctions for substitutes and complements goods. Our
scheme provides bidders with a simple, dominant and 
truthful bidding strategy even though the market remains open
and dynamic.
In addition to exploring more sophisticated proxies that
bid in terms of maximum willingness to pay, future work
should aim to better model seller incentives and resolve the
strategic problems facing sellers. For instance, does the 
options scheme change seller incentives from what they 
currently are on eBay?
