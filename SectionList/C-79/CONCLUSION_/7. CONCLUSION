To facilitate resource discovery and distribution over MANETs,
one approach is to designing peer-to-peer (P2P) systems over
MANETs which constructs an overlay by organizing peers of the
system into a logical structure on the top of MANETs" physical
topology. However, deploying overlay over MANETs may result
in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the
routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth usage. 
Specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing 
protocols. In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the
overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery
message since the routing path in each routing step must be 
discovered on demand. On the other hand, if a proactive routing
protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast 
control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of 
bandwidth usage. Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially
suffer from the scalability problem. The paper describes a design
paradigm that uses the functional primitives of positive/negative
feedback and sporadic random walk to design robust resource
discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs. In particular,
the scheme offers the features of (1) cross-layer design of P2P
systems, which allows the routing process at both the P2P and the
network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead, (2) scalability
and mobility support, which minimizes the use of global flooding
operations and adaptively combines proactive resource 
advertisement and reactive resource discovery, and (3) load balancing,
which facilitates resource replication, relocation, and division to
achieve load balancing.
