Our algorithm and implementation replaced CPLEX as
the clearing algorithm of the Alliance for Paired Donation,
one of the leading kidney exchanges, in December 2006. We
conduct a match run every two weeks, and the first 
transplants based on our solutions have already been conducted.
While there are (for political/inter-personal reasons) at
least four kidney exchanges in the US currently, everyone
understands that a unified unfragmented national exchange
would save more lives. We are in discussions with additional
kidney exchanges that are interested in adopting our 
technology. This way our technology (and the processes around
it) will hopefully serve as a substrate that will eventually
help in unifying the exchanges. At least computational 
scalability is no longer an obstacle.
