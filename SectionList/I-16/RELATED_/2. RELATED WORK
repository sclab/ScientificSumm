The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been 
amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems
and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1]. These systems 
typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual
viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal 
devices where the owner"s preferences and interests can be gathered
and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise
some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites
such as Amazon.com).
Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have
been much more limited. Gerding et al. present a simulated system
(CASy) whereby a Vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell 
advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall [2]. The
auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by
different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are 
selected for presentation on public displays. Feedback is provided
through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build
up a profile of a user"s preferences. However, unlike the BluScreen

system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to
many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction
with a single user to acquire the user"s preferences.
By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype 
implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a
group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several 
members of the audience [7]. User identification is based on infrared
badges and embedded sensors within an office environment. When
several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares
the user"s profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content
that matches this common interest is shown.
Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers
to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a 
prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects
content to match their profiles. Despite their similarities, neither
system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate
advertising space between competing advertisers who face an 
audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile
information. Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype
BluScreen system that motivates our work.
