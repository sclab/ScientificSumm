As described above, we consider the case that the advertising agents
do not have an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing
the advert to a single user. Rather, they have a constrained budget,
B, and a limited period of interest during which they wish to 
display their advert. Their goal is then to find the appropriate amount
to bid within each auction in this period, in order to maximise the
exposure of their advert.
In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced
with a high level of uncertainty about future events. It will be 
uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any 
advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present
3
This assumption of having a single BluScreen instance is made
to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency
of the proposed mechanism and strategy, and generalising these
results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work.
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 265
is known, some may leave before the advert commences, and 
others may arrive. Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure
that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number
and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.
Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival
and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon
independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users
who are likely to be exposed to any advert. In addition, we enable
the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle 
auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success
or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a 
probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction. The agent then uses
these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising
cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that 
maximises this utility given its constrained budget. Having calculated
this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually
used in the auction for the next advertising cycle. However, at the
close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal 
sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what
actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid
was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).
Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two 
probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of
the advertising agent.
5.1 Predicting the Number of Users
In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any
future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic
model for the behaviour of the users. Thus, our advanced bidding
strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by
two independent Poisson processes4
with arrival rate, λa, and 
departure rate, λd. This represents a simple model that is commonly
applied within queuing theory5
[5], yet is one that we believe well
describes the case where BluScreen displays are placed in 
communal areas where people meet and congregate. Given the history of
users" arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection
agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood 
estimation of the values of λa and λd.
In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users 
arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood 
estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by:
λa =
n
t
(1)
Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay
of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood 
estimation for the departure rate λd is given by:
1
λd
=
1
n

i=1

Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of
events, n, within an interval of time t is given by:
P(n) =
e−λt
(λt)n
n!
In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t,
before the next event is determined by:
P(t) = λeλt
5
Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate
and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson 
processes. Our users are not actually modelled as a queue since the
duration of their stay is independent of that of the other users.

Figure 3: Example showing how to predict the number of users
who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc,
commencing at time t in the future.
In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent
can use a limited time window over which observations are used
to estimate these rates. Alternatively, in situations where cyclic
changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and
departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas
where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate
values over each hour long period.
Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and
knowing the number of users who are present at the current time,
the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users
who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6
. Thus,
we consider the problem of predicting this number for an 
advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given
that n users are currently present (see figure 3). This number will
be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are
initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before
the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in
the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising
cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during
the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.
Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n
users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given
by
∞

λde−λdτ
dτ = e−λdt
. Thus we expect ne−λdt
of these
users to be present. In case (ii), we expect λat new users to 
arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability
that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is
given by 1

. Thus we expect

of these users to be present. Finally, in case (iii)
we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising
cycle. Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an 
expression for the expected number of users who will be present within
an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the
future, given that there are n users currently present:
Nn,t = ne−λdt

λd
1 − e−λdt
+ λatc (3)
Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the
initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at
any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed
to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1
λd
.
5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning
In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present
in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be
able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it
submits any specified bid. This is a common problem within 
bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game
theoretic or decision theoretic. Since our advertising agents are
unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising
6
Note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire
advertising cycle in order to be counted as present.
266 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
agents, the game theoretic approach is precluded. Thus, we take a
decision theoretic approach similar to that adopted within 
continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price
of goods by observing transaction prices [4].
Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to
describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted
bid, P(b). This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must
be positive. In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an ‘s" shaped
curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when
the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when
the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises
the change from a losing to a wining bid. To this end, we use the
cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function:
P(b) =
γ (k, b/θ)
Γ (k)
(4)
where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the
incomplete gamma function. This function has the necessary 
properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ. The 
transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of
the transition is described by kθ2
. In figure 4 we show examples of
this function for three different values of k and θ.
The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k
and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous
auctions. An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid,
bi, and an auction outcome, oi. Each auction generates at least one
pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and
oi = 1. In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful
bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi =
0. Thus, having collected N such pairs7
, the agent finds the values
of k and θ by evaluating:
arg min
k,θ
N
i=1
oi −
γ (k, bi/θ)
Γ (k)
2
(5)
This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply
found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the 
values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the
transition point described above. The gradient of this expression
is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of
k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction
of maximum gradient. This process is repeated until k and θ have
converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle
The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure
for its advert given its constrained budget. We define the utility
of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will
see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we
explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing
the advert to any user more than once8
. Thus, we can use the results
of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each
advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agent"s period of
7
In the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed, there is
no evidence of where the transition point between successful and
unsuccessful bids is likely to occur. Thus, in this case, an 
additional pair with value {α min(b1 . . . bn), 0} is automatically 
created. Here α ∈ [0, 1] determines how far below the lowest 
successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be. We
have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments.
8
As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they
are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not
differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who
see a fraction of it.

interest. In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by
the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given
that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in
front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before,
is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply
described by:
u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6)
Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly
depend on the outcome of the auction for the first. If the first 
auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who
have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second 
advertising cycle. Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users
who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described
by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).
By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the
expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by
Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e.
exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users
initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the
future). Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle
is given by:
u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7)
We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users 
expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend
on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this
point the number of users who are present but have not seen the
advert must be equal to zero). Thus, we must sum over all possible
ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.
Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by
the rather complex expression:
ui = P(bi)

i−1
m=j+1
(1 − P(bm))
+ Nn,(i−1)tc

m=1
(1 − P(bm)) (8)
Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to
calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such
that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the
remaining budget, B, is not exceeded:

Figure 5: Total expected utility of the advertising agent over a
continuous range of values of b1 for a number of discrete values
of budget, B, when there are just two auction cycles.
Having calculated this sequence, a bid of b1 is submitted in the next
auction. Once the outcome of this auction is known, the process
repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for
the remaining advertising cycles of the agent"s period of interest.
5.4 Optimal Sequence of Bids
Solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 9
can not be performed analytically. Instead we develop a numerical
routine to perform this maximisation. However, it is informative to
initially consider the simple case of just two auctions.
5.4.1 Two Auction Example
In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply
given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the 
bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1). Thus,
we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically 
determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).
To this end, figure 5 shows an example calculated using 
parameter values λa = 1/120, λd = 1/480 and tc = 120. In this case, we
assume that k = 10 and θ = 1, and thus, given that kθ describes
the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution, a bid of 10 
represents a 50% chance of winning any auction (i.e. P(10) = 0.5).
In addition, we assume that n = λa/λd = 4, and thus the initial
number of users present is equal to the mean number that we expect
to find present at any time. The plot indicates that when the budget
is small, then the maximum utility is achieved at the extreme values
of b1. This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions
(i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0). However, as the
budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the
maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, 
corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).
This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate
the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the
probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.
In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the 
number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e.
n = λa/λd). If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that
when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second 
auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising
cycle commences). Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire 
budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are
currently present are likely to depart in the near future). However,
in both cases, a transition occurs whereby given sufficient budget it
is preferable to allocate the budget evenly between both auctions9

5.4.2 General Case
In general, the behaviour seen in the previous example 
characterises the optimal bidding behaviour of the advertising agent. If
there is sufficient budget, bidding equally in all auctions results in
the maximum expected utility. However, typically this is not 
possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget
is available into a subset of the available auction. The choice of
this subset is determined by a number of factors. If there are very
few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to
later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive. 
Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of
the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is
indeed won, and these users see the advert. Finally, since no utility
is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once,
the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between
showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.
Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected
utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to 
analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids. However, the inverse
problem (that of calculating the expected utility for any given 
sequence of bids) is easy. Thus, we can use a stochastic optimisation
routine based on simulated annealing to solve the maximisation
problem. This algorithm starts by assuming some initial random
allocation of bids (normalised such that the total of all the bids is
equal to the budget B). It then makes small adjustments to this 
allocation by randomly transferring the budget from one auction to
another. If this transfer results in an increase in expected utility,
then it is accepted. If it results in a decrease in expected utility, it
might still be accepted, but with a probability that is determined by
a temperature parameter. This temperature parameter is annealed
such that the probability of accepting such transfers decreases over
time. In figure 6 we present this algorithm in pseudo-code.
