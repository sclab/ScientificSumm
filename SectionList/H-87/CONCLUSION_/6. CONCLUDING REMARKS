We presented a cross-benchmark evaluation of incremental
Rocchio and incremental LR in adaptive filtering, focusing on
their robustness in terms of performance consistency with
respect to cross-corpus parameter optimization. Our main
conclusions from this study are the following:
• Parameter optimization in AF is an open challenge but has
not been thoroughly studied in the past.
• Robustness in cross-corpus parameter tuning is important
for evaluation and method comparison.
• We found LR more robust than Rocchio; it had the best
results (in T11SU) ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and
TREC11 without extensive tuning.
• We found Rocchio performs strongly when a good
validation corpus is available, and a preferred choice when
optimizing Ctrk is the objective, favoring recall over
precision to an extreme.
For future research we want to study explicit modeling of the
temporal trends in topic distributions and content drifting.
