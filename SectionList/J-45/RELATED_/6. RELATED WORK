The mechanism design literature in Economics has typically 
explored existence of a mechanism that implements a social choice
function in equilibrium [10]. Additionally, there is an extensive 
literature on optimal auction design [10], of which the work by Roger
Myerson [11] is, perhaps, the most relevant. In much of this work,
analytical results are presented with respect to specific utility 
functions and accounting for constraints such as incentive compatibility
and individual rationality.
Several related approaches to search for the best mechanism 
exist in the Computer Science literature. Conitzer and Sandholm [6]
developed a search algorithm when all the relevant game 
parameters are common knowledge. When payoff functions of players
are unknown, a search using simulations has been explored as an
alternative. One approach in that direction, taken in [4] and [15],
is to co-evolve the mechanism parameter and agent strategies, 
using some notion of social utility and agent payoffs as fitness 
criteria. An alternative to co-evolution explored in [16] was to 
optimize a well-defined welfare function of the designer using genetic
programming. In this work the authors used a common learning
strategy for all agents and defined an outcome of a game induced
by a mechanism parameter as the outcome of joint agent learning.
Most recently, Phelps et al. [14] compared two mechanisms based
on expected social utility with expectation taken over an empirical
distribution of equilibria in games defined by heuristic strategies,
as in [18].
