At this point, we explore abstractly whether a design parameter
choice based on payoff data can be asymptotically reliable.

Since we did not have all the possible deviations for any profile
available in the data, the true upper bounds may be even lower.
As a matter of convenience, we will use notation un,i(a) to 
refer to a payoff function of player i based on an average over n
i.i.d. samples from the distribution of payoffs. We also assume that
un,i(a) are independent for all a ∈ A and i ∈ I. We will use
the notation Γn to refer to the game [I, R, {ui,n(·)}], whereas Γ
will denote the underlying game, [I, R, {ui(·)}]. Similarly, we
define n(r) to be (r) with respect to the game Γn.
In this section, we show that n(s) → (s) a.s. uniformly on
the mixed strategy space for any finite game, and, furthermore, that
all mixed strategy Nash equilibria in empirical games eventually
become arbitrarily close to some Nash equilibrium strategies in the
underlying game. We use these results to show that under certain
conditions, the optimal choice of the design parameter based on
empirical data converges almost surely to the actual optimum.
THEOREM 3. Suppose that |I| < ∞, |A| < ∞. Then n(s) →
(s) a.s. uniformly on S.
Recall that N is a set of all Nash equilibria of Γ. If we define
Nn,γ = {s ∈ S : n(s) ≤ γ}, we have the following corollary to
Theorem 3:
COROLLARY 4. For every γ > 0, there is M such that ∀n ≥
M, N ⊂ Nn,γ a.s.
PROOF. Since (s) = 0 for every s ∈ N, we can find M large
enough such that Pr{supn≥M sups∈N n(s) < γ} = 1.
By the Corollary, for any game with a finite set of pure strategies
and for any > 0, all Nash equilibria lie in the set of empirical
-Nash equilibria if enough samples have been taken. As we now
show, this provides some justification for our use of a set of profiles
with a non-zero -bound as an estimate of the set of Nash equilibria.
First, suppose we conclude that for a particular setting of θ,
sup{ˆφ∗
(θ)} ≤ α. Then, since for any fixed > 0, N(θ) ⊂
Nn, (θ) when n is large enough,
sup{φ∗
(θ)} = sup
s∈N (θ)
φ(s) ≤
sup
s∈Nn, (θ)
φ(s) = sup{ˆφ∗
(θ)} ≤ α
for any such n. Thus, since we defined the welfare function of
the designer to be I{sup{φ∗
(θ)} ≤ α} in our domain of interest,
the empirical choice of θ satisfies the designer"s objective, thereby
maximizing his welfare function.
Alternatively, suppose we conclude that inf{ˆφ∗
(θ)} > α for 
every θ in the domain. Then,
α < inf{ˆφ∗
(θ)} = inf
s∈Nn, (θ)
φ(s) ≤ inf
s∈N (θ)
φ(s) ≤
≤ sup
s∈N (θ)
φ(s) = sup{φ∗
(θ)},
for every θ, and we can conclude that no setting of θ will satisfy
the designer"s objective.
Now, we will show that when the number of samples is large
enough, every Nash equilibrium of Γn is close to some Nash 
equilibrium of the underlying game. This result will lead us to consider
convergence of optimizers based on empirical data to actual 
optimal mechanism parameter settings.
We first note that the function (s) is continuous in a finite game.
LEMMA 5. Let S be a mixed strategy set defined on a finite
game. Then : S → R is continuous.

For the exposition that follows, we need a bit of additional 
notation. First, let (Z, d) be a metric space, and X, Y ⊂ Z and define
directed Hausdorff distance from X to Y to be
h(X, Y ) = sup
x∈X
inf
y∈Y
d(x, y).
Observe that U ⊂ X ⇒ h(U, Y ) ≤ h(X, Y ). Further, define
BS(x, δ) to be an open ball in S ⊂ Z with center x ∈ S and
radius δ. Now, let Nn denote all Nash equilibria of the game Γn
and let
Nδ =
[
x∈N
BS(x, δ),
that is, the union of open balls of radius δ with centers at Nash
equilibria of Γ. Note that h(Nδ, N) = δ.
We can then prove the following general result.
THEOREM 6. Suppose |I| < ∞ and |A| < ∞. Then almost
surely h(Nn, N) converges to 0.
We will now show that in the special case when Θ and A are
finite and each Γθ has a unique Nash equilibrium, the estimates
ˆθ of optimal designer parameter converge to an actual optimizer
almost surely.
Let ˆθ = arg maxθ∈Θ W (Nn(θ), θ), where n is the number of
times each pure profile was sampled in Γθ for every θ, and let θ∗
=
arg maxθ∈Θ W (N(θ), θ).
THEOREM 7. Suppose |N(θ)| = 1 for all θ ∈ Θ and suppose
that Θ and A are finite. Let W (s, θ) be continuous at the unique
s∗
(θ) ∈ N(θ) for each θ ∈ Θ. Then ˆθ is a consistent estimator of
θ∗
if W (N(θ), θ) is defined as a supremum, infimum, or 
expectation over the set of Nash equilibria. In fact, ˆθ → θ∗
a.s. in each of
these cases.
The shortcoming of the above result is that, within our 
framework, the designer has no way of knowing or ensuring that Γθ do,
indeed, have unique equilibria. However, it does lend some 
theoretical justification for pursuing design in this manner, and, perhaps,
will serve as a guide for more general results in the future.
