Our proposed methods employ learning and search techniques to
estimate outcome features of interest as a function of mechanism
parameter settings. We illustrate our approach with a design task
from a supply-chain trading competition. Designers adopted 
several rule changes in order to deter particular procurement behavior,
but the measures proved insufficient. Our empirical mechanism
analysis models the relation between a key design parameter and
outcomes, confirming the observed behavior and indicating that no
reasonable parameter settings would have been likely to achieve the
desired effect. More generally, we show that under certain 
conditions, the estimator of optimal mechanism parameter setting based
on empirical data is consistent.
