In this work we spent considerable effort developing general 
tactics for empirical mechanism design. We defined a formal 
gametheoretic model of interaction between the designer and the 
participants of the mechanism as a two-stage game. We also described in
some generality the methods for estimating a sample Nash 
equilibrium function when the data is extremely scarce, or a Nash 
equilibrium correspondence when more data is available. Our techniques
are designed specifically to deal with problems in which both the
mechanism parameter space and the agent strategy sets are infinite
and only a relatively small data set can be acquired.
A difficult design issue in the TAC/SCM game which the TAC
community has been eager to address provides us with a setting
to test our methods. In applying empirical game analysis to the
problem at hand, we are fully aware that our results are inherently
inexact. Thus, we concentrate on collecting evidence about the
structure of the Nash equilibrium correspondence. In the end, we
can try to provide enough evidence to either prescribe a parameter
setting, or suggest that no setting is possible that will satisfy the
designer. In the case of TAC/SCM, our evidence suggests quite
strongly that storage cost could not have been effectively adjusted
in the 2004 tournament to curb excessive day-0 procurement 
without detrimental effects on overall profitability. The success of our
analysis in this extremely complex environment with high 
simulation costs makes us optimistic that our methods can provide 
guidance in making mechanism design decisions in other challenging
domains. The theoretical results confirm some intuitions behind
the empirical mechanism design methods we have introduced, and
increases our confidence that our framework can be effective in 
estimating the best mechanism parameter choice in relatively general
settings.
