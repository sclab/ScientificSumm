People are information processors. Most cognitive 
scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system
consists of an executive component and three main 
information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains
information for one second or so; (b) working (or 
shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold
(approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain
(for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three 
information elements simultaneously) information; and (c) 
longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and
contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized
as schemata. Cognitive load studies are, by and large, 
concerned about working memory capacity and how to 
circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such
as learning and decision making.
According to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load
is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the
load that a particular task imposes on the performer. It
has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be
characteristics of the subject (e.g. expertise level), the task
(e.g. task complexity, time pressure), the environment (e.g.
noise), and their mutual relations. It also has an 
assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of 
mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental
demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually 
allocated to the task), and performance.
Lang"s information-processing model [7] consists of three
major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. The 
encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores
that are relevant to a person"s goals into working memory;
the storage process consolidates the newly encoded 
information into chunks, and form associations and schema to 
facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the
associated memory network for a specific element/schema
and reactivates it into working memory. The model 
suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are 
independently allocated to the three processes. In addition,
working memory is used both for holding and for 
processing information [1]. Due to limited capacity, when greater
effort is required to process information, less capacity 
remains for the storage of information. Hence, the allocation
of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in 
order to enhance human performance. This comes to the issue
of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for
cognitive scientists.
Cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load,
mental effort, and performance using rating scales, 
psychophysiological (e.g. measures of heart activity, brain 
activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12]. 
Selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially
when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.
Although physiological measures are sometimes highly 
sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs
and work place conditions often favor task- and 
performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary
task as well as the primary task under consideration. 
Secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that
performance on a secondary task reflects the level of 
cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15]. From the resource
allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity,
any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary
task must inevitably decrease resources available for the 
secondary task [7]. Consequently, performance in a secondary
task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary
task increases. The level of cognitive load can thus be 
manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is
getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.
A secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or
auditory signal but requires sustained attention. Its 
performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy,
and error rate. However, one important drawback of 
secondary task performance, as noted by Paas [12], is that it
can interfere considerably with the primary task 
(competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is
complex. To better understand and measure cognitive load,
Xie and Salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework,
which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load, 
accumulated load, average load, and overall load. It seems that
the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the 
dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for
monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can
be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the
overall performance in human-agent collaborations.
