SMMall (Shared Mental Models for all) is a cognitive
agent architecture developed for supporting human-centric
collaborative computing. It stresses human"s role in team
activities by means of novel collaborative concepts and 
multiple representations of context woven through all aspects of
team work. Here we describe two components pertinent to
the experiment reported in Section 5: multi-party 
communication and shared mental maps (a complete description of
the SMMall system is beyond the scope of this paper).
4.1 Multi-Party Communication
Multi-party communication refers to conversations 
involving more than two parties. Aside from the speaker, the 
listeners involved in a conversation can be classified into 
various roles such as addressees (the direct listeners), auditors
(the intended listeners), overhearers (the unintended but 
anticipated listeners), and eavesdroppers (the unanticipated
listeners). Multi-party communication is one of the 
characteristics of human teams. SMMall agents, which can form
Human-Agent-Pairs with human partners, support 
multiparty communication with the following features.
1. SMMall supports a collection of multi-party 
performatives such as MInform (multi-party inform), MAnnounce
(multi-party announce), and MAsk (multi-party ask). The
listeners of a multi-party performative can be addressees, 
auditors, and overhearers, which correspond to ‘to", ‘cc", and
‘bcc" in e-mail terms, respectively.
2. SMMall supports channelled-communication. There
398 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
are three built-in channels: agentTalk channel (inter-agent
activity-specific communication), control channel (meta 
communication for team coordination), and world channel 
(communication with the external world). An agent can fully
tune to a channel to collect messages sent (or cc, bcc)
to it. An agent can also partially tune to a channel to get
statistic information about the messages communicated over
the channel. This is particularly useful if an agent wants to
know the communication load imposed on a teammate.
4.2 Shared Belief Map & Load Display
A concept shared belief map has been proposed and 
implemented into SMMall; this responds to the need to seek
innovative perspectives or concepts that allow group 
members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental
models at different levels of abstraction. As described in 
Section 5, humans and agents interacted through shared belief
maps in the evaluation of HMM-based load models.
A shared belief map is a table with color-coded 
info-cellscells associated with information. Each row captures the
belief model of one team member, and each column 
corresponds to a specific information type (all columns together
define the boundary of the information space being 
considered). Thus, info-cell Cij of a map encodes all the beliefs
(instances) of information type j held by agent i. Color
coding applies to each info-cell to indicate the number of
information instances held by the corresponding agent.
The concept of shared belief map helps maintain and
present a human partner with a synergy view of the shared
mental models evolving within a team. Briefly, SMMall has
implemented the concept with the following features:
1. A context menu can be popped up for each info-cell
to view and share the associated information instances. It
allows selective (selected subset) or holistic info-sharing.
2. Mixed-initiative info-sharing: both agents and human
partners can initiate a multi-party conversation. It also 
allows third-party info-sharing, say, A shares the information
held by B with C.
3. Information types that are semantically related (e.g.,
by inference rules) can be closely organized. Hence, nearby
info-cells can form meaningful plateaus (or contour lines) of
similar colors. Colored plateaus indicate those sections of a
shared mental model that bear high overlapping degrees.
4. The perceptible color (hue) difference manifested from
a shared belief map indicates the information difference among
team members, and hence visually represents the potential
information needs of each team member (See Figure 3).
SMMall has also implemented the HMM-based models
(Section 3) to allow an agent to estimate its human 
partner"s and other team members" cognitive/processing loads.
As shown in Fig. 3, below the shared belief map there is
a load display for each team member. There are 2 curves in
a display: the blue (dark) one plots human"s instantaneous
cognitive loads and the red one plots the processing loads of
a HAP as a whole. If there are n team members, each agent
needs to maintain 2n HMM-based models to support the
load displays. The human partner of a HAP can adjust her
cognitive load at runtime, as well as monitor another HAP"s
agent processing load and its probability of processing the
information she sends at the current time step. Thus, the
more closely a HAP can estimate the actual processing loads
of other HAPs, the better information sharing performance
the HAP can achieve.

In sum, shared belief maps allow the inference of who
needs what, and load displays allow the judgment of when
to share information. Together they allow us to investigate
the impact of sharing the right info. with the right party at
the right time on the evolving of shared mental models.
4.3 Metrics for Shared Mental Models
We here describe how we measure team performance in
our experiment. We use mental model overlapping 
percentage (MMOP) as the base to measure shared mental
models. MMOP of a group is defined as the intersection of
all the individual mental states relative to the union of 
individual mental states of the group. Formally, given a group
of k agents G = {Ai|1 ≤ i ≤ k}, let Bi = {Iim|1 ≤ m ≤ n}
be the beliefs (information) held by agent Ai, where each
Iim is a set of information of the same type, and n (the size
of information space) is fixed for the agents in G, then
MMOP(G) =
100
n
1≤m≤n
(
| ∩1≤i≤k Iim|
| ∪1≤i≤k Iim|
). (3)
First, a shared mental model can be measured in terms of
the distance of averaged subgroup MMOPs to the MMOP
of the whole group. Without losing generality, we define
paired SMM distance (subgroups of size 2) D2 as:
D2 (G) =
1≤i<j≤k
(MMOP({Ai, Aj}) − MMOP(G))2
. (4)
The MMOP of a subgroup is always larger than the MMOP
of the whole group. Intuitively, the larger distance from the
MMOP of a subgroup to that of the whole group, the more
overlapping mental models the subgroup shares. This 
notion can be used to measure the tightness of an emerging
subgroup or guide the process of team coalition.
Second, due to communication or information processing
limits, each individual"s subjective measure of the group"s
MMOP can be very different from the group"s MMOP 
measured objectively from external. A shared mental model can
thus be measured in terms of the closeness of individuals"
measure of the group"s MMOP to the objective measure. Let
MMOP(G) and M MOPi(G) be the objective measure and
agent Ai"s subjective measure of the group"s shared mental
models, respectively. We define SMM deviation D⊥ as:
D⊥(G) =
1≤i≤k
(MMOPi(G) − MMOP(G))2
. (5)
Obviously, D⊥ measures the coherency of the whole group:
the smaller the better.
Third, shared mental models evolve over time. A shared
mental model can be measured in terms of the 
stableness of the instantaneous measures of MMOP, D , or D⊥
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 399
over time. High performing teams can often maintain their
shared mental models such that the MMOP is stable at an
acceptable level as activities proceed, while the MMOP 
measure of the shared mental models of a low-performing teams
can fluctuate or decrease notably over time.
