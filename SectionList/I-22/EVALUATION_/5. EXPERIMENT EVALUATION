In this section we describe the experiments conducted to
evaluate the load estimation models and the shared belief
map concept for developing team shared mental models.
5.1 Problem Description
The members of a HAP team (i.e., a team composed
of Human-Agent-Pairs) are situated in a dynamic 
environment. Due to their different (maybe overlapping) 
observability, at each time step they may get different situational
information. The goal of a HAP team is to selectively share
information in a timely manner to develop global situation
awareness (say, for making critical decisions).
Each run of the experiment has 45 time steps; each time
step lasts 15 seconds. A time step starts with certain 
infocells of the shared belief map being flashed quickly (for 2
s). The flashed cells are exactly those with newly available
information that should be shared at that time step. An
info-cell is frozen at the end of a time step: the associated
information is no longer sharable. This requires that the
newly available information be shared in time, not later.
The human and agent of a HAP assume different roles.
An agent governs group communication and processes 
messages to update the shared belief map on its display. An
agent, with a pre-trained HMM-based cognitive load model
for its human partner and a processing load model for each
of the other HAPs in the team, also estimates and displays
their instantaneous loads. Human subjects need to perform
a primary task and a secondary task. The secondary task of
a human subject is to remember and mark the cells being
flashed (not necessarily in the exact order) by left mouse
clicks. Secondary task performance at step t is thus 
measured as the number of cells marked (remembered) correctly
at t, which is taken as the observable state of the 
HMMbased cognitive load model of that human subject. The
primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental
model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right 
information with the right party at the right time. To share the
information associated with an info-cell, a human subject
needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select
the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu.
There are costs associated with information sharing. 
Communications among HAPs is done by the corresponding 
SMMall agents, which have both limited capacity nin for 
processing incoming information and limited outgoing 
communication capacity nout. Thus, depending on the current HAP
load, an agent may randomly ignore part or all of the 
incoming information (having no effect on the establishment of
shared mental models). On the other hand, each time step
at most nout number of information-sharing commands can
be effective; more than that contribute nothing to the 
establishment of shared mental models. Sending information
to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that 
otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded
teammate. This means that at each time step a human 
subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions:
whether the information under consideration needs to be
shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just
flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share
the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the 
information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e.,
whether the team member is currently overloaded).
The above description applies to HAP teams. For teams
composed of SMMall agents only, the agents will take all the
roles played by an agent or a human partner in HAP teams.
5.2 Experiment Design
To investigate the impacts of the HMM-based load models
on the evolution of shared mental models (SMM), we 
conducted experiments for both Agent teams and HAP teams,
where agent teams involve agent processing load models
only, HAP teams involve models of HAP processing load
(i.e., the co-effect of agent processing load and human 
cognitive load). To get insights on how load predictions and
multi-party communication may affect the performance of
forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3)
and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt
the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.
When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1)
ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2) 
consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow
load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents
will further group the receivers of a multi-party message
(MInform) by their loads and split the message into 
multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.
For example, given that agents A1, A2, A3 have load 1, 2,
1, respectively. An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send
one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of
TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).
In addition, we controlled agents" outgoing communication
capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.
Due to constraints on communication capacity and 
processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking
other teammates" mental models. In order to measure the
actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named
‘OmniAll" was added to each team to monitor inter-agent
communications and record the actual effects of 
information sharing on each agent"s mental model. This realizes a
way, as suggested by Klimoski [6], to measuring the degree of
overlap in immediate, intermediate, and long-term situation
awareness zones held by group members.
We also recorded instantaneous information sharing 
utility, which is defined as follows. At each time step, let T =
T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 be a sequence of sets, where T0, T1, T2, T3,
and T4 are sets of teammates whose current load states are
negligibly, slightly, fairly, heavily, and overly 
respectively. Let S be the set of information-sharing 
commands issued by a human partner at the current step. Let
Mi = {Tk ∈ T|k ≤ i, Tk = ∅}. Instantaneous info-sharing
utility is defined as c∈S s value(c)/|S|, where
s value(c) =
⎧

In sum, this study involved 18 types of teams, each team
had 4 members, and each team type was tested by 10 domain
scenarios. 30 human subjects were recruited for HAP teams.
The experiment results are plotted in Figures 4, 6, and 7.
We next present our findings in this study.

Figure 4: Evolution of SMMs.
Consider teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) and teams of type
2 (TA2, TH2). First look at the performance of HAP teams
in Fig. 4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance
(percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams 
increased as communication capacity increased 
(TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10). (2) The averaged 
performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than
the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6,
TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance 
difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication
capacity increased. This indicates that, other things being
equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing
information becomes more significant when communication
capacity is larger. From Fig. 4 the same findings can be
derived for the performance of agent teams.
In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each
team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after
about 20 time steps. However, to maintain a SMM steadily
at a certain level is a non-trivial team task. The performance
of teams who did not share any information (the ‘NoSharing"
curve in Fig. 4) decreased constantly as time proceeded.
5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM
We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits
multi-party messages by receivers" loads). As plotted in Fig.
4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each
fixed communication capacity was consistently better than
team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8, 
TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as 
communication capacity increased. These also hold for the Agent teams
(upper one in Fig. 4). Actually, the performance of type 3

agent teams was even worse (for each fixed capacity) than
the performance of type 1 agent teams.
This can be explained by the difference of two-party and
multi-party communications. In SMMall, in order to enable
team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model
of every team member"s mental model (beliefs). According
to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A
MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and 
overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of
their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon 
getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its
model of the sender"s and all the other receivers" beliefs.
Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party 
performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.
As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), agent A only needs to perform
MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve
the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It 
consumes 2 of A"s communication resources, one for each 
receiver). However, to achieve the same effects using Inform
(Fig. 5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially
when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all
others" efforts). Moreover, although agent A still consumes
2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).
However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers" loads
does enhance subgroup SMMs. In Fig. 6 we plotted the
other two measures of SMMs (distance and closeness as
defined in Sec. 4.3). For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1
holds in Fig. 6(c) (larger distances indicate better 
subgroup SMMs), and TH3<TH2<TH1 holds in Fig. 6(d)
(smaller deviations indicate higher coherency of the whole
team). Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup
SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view
of group SMMs than teams of other types. For agent teams,
TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig. 6(a), and TH2<TH3<TH1
holds in Fig. 6(b). Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved
better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much
higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1
(although slightly worse than team type 2).
Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages
the forming/evolving of team SMMs. When a group of
agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages
by their loads can be more effective for subteam SMMs.
5.5 The HMM-based Cognitive Model
To validate the HMM-based cognitive load model is 
extremely difficult because detecting the real, noise-resistant
cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current
technology. As an indirect judgment, we plotted the 
regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility
of HAP teams with and without load displays. For the HAP
teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear
relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load
levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is −
√
0.899 = −0.948
with P-Value = 0.014). Because the info-sharing utility
measure and the cognitive load measure are indicators of
primary task performance and secondary task performance,
respectively, their linear relationship complies with 
cognitive studies that secondary task performance can be used

to explain primary task performance. However, for teams
without load displays there is a strong quadratic rather than
linear relationship (correlation coefficient is
√
0.974 = 0.987
with P-Value = 0.015). This indicates that the information
sharing performance of a HAP team can be significantly 
affected by both the human subject"s own cognitive load, and
the awareness of other team members" load. Knowing of 
others" load (by estimation) will reduce the quadratic relation
to a linear relation.
