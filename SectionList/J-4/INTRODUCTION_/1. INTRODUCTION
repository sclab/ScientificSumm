Major search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and MSN sell
advertisements by auctioning off space on keyword search
results pages. For example, when a user searches the web for
iPod, the highest paying advertisers (for example, Apple
or Best Buy) for that keyword may appear in a separate
sponsored section of the page above or to the right of the
algorithmic results. The sponsored results are displayed in a
format similar to algorithmic results: as a list of items each
containing a title, a text description, and a hyperlink to a
web page. Generally, advertisements that appear in a higher
position on the page garner more attention and more clicks
from users. Thus, all else being equal, advertisers prefer
higher positions to lower positions.
Advertisers bid for placement on the page in an 
auctionstyle format where the larger their bid the more likely their
listing will appear above other ads on the page. By 
convention, sponsored search advertisers generally bid and pay per
click, meaning that they pay only when a user clicks on their
ad, and do not pay if their ad is displayed but not clicked.
Overture Services, formerly GoTo.com and now owned by
Yahoo! Inc., is credited with pioneering sponsored search
advertising. Overture"s success prompted a number of 
companies to adopt similar business models, most prominently
Google, the leading web search engine today. Microsoft"s
MSN, previously an affiliate of Overture, now operates its
own keyword auction marketplace. Sponsored search is one
of the fastest growing, most effective, and most profitable
forms of advertising, generating roughly $7 billion in revenue
in 2005 after nearly doubling every year for the previous five
years.
The search engine evaluates the advertisers" bids and 
allocates the positions on the page accordingly. Notice that, 
although bids are expressed as payments per click, the search
engine cannot directly allocate clicks, but rather allocates
impressions, or placements on the screen. Clicks relate only
stochastically to impressions. Until recently, Yahoo! ranked
bidders in decreasing order of advertisers" stated values per
click, while Google ranks in decreasing order of advertisers"
stated values per impression. In Google"s case, value per
impression is computed by multiplying the advertiser"s 
(perclick) bid by the advertisement"s expected click-through rate,
where this expectation may consider a number of 
unspecified factors including historical click-through rate, position
on the page, advertiser identity, user identity, and the 
context of other items on the page. We refer to these rules as
rank-by-bid and rank-by-revenue, respectively.1
We analyze a family of ranking rules that contains the 
Yahoo! and Google models as special cases. We consider 
rank1
These are industry terms. We will see, however, that 
rankby-revenue is not necessarily revenue-optimal.

ing rules where bidders are ranked in decreasing order of
score eq
b, where e denotes an advertiser"s click-through rate
(normalized for position) and b his bid. Notice that q = 0
corresponds to Yahoo!"s rank-by-bid rule and q = 1 
corresponds to Google"s rank-by-revenue rule. Our premise is
that bidders are playing a symmetric equilibrium, as defined
by Edelman, Ostrovsky, and Schwarz [3] and Varian [11].
We show through simulation that although q = 1 yields
the efficient allocation, settings of q considerably less than
1 can yield superior revenue in equilibrium under certain
conditions. The key parameter is the correlation between
advertiser value and click-through rate. If this correlation is
strongly positive, then smaller q are revenue-optimal. Our
simulations are based on distributions fitted to data from
Yahoo! keyword auctions. We propose that search engines
set thresholds of acceptable loss in advertiser satisfaction
and user experience, then choose the revenue-optimal q 
consistent with these constraints. We also compare the 
potential gains from tuning q with the gains from setting reserve
prices, and find that the former may be much more 
significant.
In Section 2 we give a formal model of keyword auctions,
and establish its equilibrium properties in Section 3. In 
Section 4 we note that giving agents bidding credits can have
the same effect as tuning the ranking rule explicitly. In 
Section 5 we give a general formulation of the optimal keyword
auction design problem as an optimization problem, in a
manner analogous to the single-item auction setting. We
then provide some theoretical insight into how tuning q can
improve revenue, and why the correlation between bidders"
values and click-through rates is relevant. In Section 6 we
consider the effect of q on advertiser satisfaction and user
experience. In Section 7 we describe our simulations and
interpret their results.
Related work. As mentioned the papers of Edelman
et al. [3] and Varian [11] lay the groundwork for our study.
Both papers independently define an appealing refinement
of Nash equilibrium for keyword auctions and analyze its
equilibrium properties. They called this refinement 
locally envy-free equilibrium and symmetric equilibrium,
respectively. Varian also provides some empirical analysis.
The general model of keyword auctions used here, where
bidders are ranked according to a weight times their bid, was
introduced by Aggarwal, Goel, and Motwani [1]. That paper
also makes a connection between the revenue of keyword
auctions in incomplete information settings with the revenue
in symmetric equilibrium. Iyengar and Kumar [5] study
the optimal keyword auction design problem in a setting
of incomplete information, and also make the connection
to symmetric equilibrium. We make use of this connection
when formulating the optimal auction design problem in our
setting.
The work most closely related to ours is that of Feng,
Bhargava, and Pennock [4]. They were the first to realize
that the correlation between bidder values and click-through
rates should be a key parameter affecting the revenue 
performance of various ranking mechanisms. For simplicity,
they assume bidders bid their true values, so their model
is very different from ours and consequently so are their
findings. According to their simulations, rank-by-revenue
always (weakly) dominates rank-by-bid in terms of revenue,
whereas our results suggest that rank-by-bid may do much
better for negative correlations.
Lahaie [8] gives an example that suggests rank-by-bid
should yield more revenue when values and click-through
rates are positively correlated, whereas rank-by-revenue should
do better when the correlation is negative. In this work we
make a deeper study of this conjecture.
