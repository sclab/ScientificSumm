We are interested in setting the weights w to achieve 
optimal expected revenue. The setup is as follows. The 
auctioneer chooses a function g so that the weighting scheme is
ws ≡ g(es). We do not consider weights that also depend on
the agents" bids because this would invalidate the 
equilibrium analysis of the previous section.4
A pool of N bidders
is then obtained by i.i.d. draws of value-relevance pairs from
a common probability density f(es, vs). We assume the 
density is continuous and has full support on [0, 1]×[0, ∞). The
revenue to the auctioneer is then the revenue generated in
symmetric equilibrium under weighting scheme w. This 
assumes the auctioneer is patient enough not to care about
revenue until bids have stabilized.
The problem of finding an optimal weighting scheme can
be formulated as an optimization problem very similar to
the one derived by Myerson [9] for the single-item auction
case (with incomplete information). Let Qsk(e, v; w) = 1 if
agent s obtains slot k in equilibrium under weighting scheme
w, where e = (e1, . . . , eN ) and v = (v1, . . . , vN ), and let it
be 0 otherwise.
Note that the total payment of agent s in equilibrium is

Hal Varian suggested to us that bidding credits could be
used to affect revenue in keyword auctions, which prompted
us to look into this connection.

The analysis does not generalize to weights that depend on
bids. It is unclear whether an equilibrium would exist at all
with such weights.

According to this analysis, we should rank bidders by 
virtual score esψ(es, vs) to optimize revenue (and exclude any
bidders with negative virtual score). However, unlike in the
incomplete information setting, here we are constrained to
ranking rules that correspond to a certain weighting scheme
ws ≡ g(es). We remark that the virtual score cannot be
reproduced exactly via a weighting scheme.
Lemma 1. There is no weighting scheme g such that the
virtual score equals the score, for any density f.
Proof. Assume there is a g such that eψ(e, v) = g(e)v.
(The subscript s is suppressed for clarity.) This is equivalent
to
d
dv
log(1 − F(v|e)) = h(e)/v, (6)
where h(e) = (g(e)/e−1)−1
. Let ¯v be such that F(¯v|e) < 1;
under the assumption of full support, there is always such
a ¯v. Integrating (6) with respect to v from 0 to ¯v, we find
that the left-hand side converges whereas the right-hand side
diverges, a contradiction.
Of course, to rank bidders by virtual score, we only need
g(es)vs = h(esψ(es, vs)) for some monotonically increasing
transformation h. (A necessary condition for this is that
ψ(es, vs) be increasing in vs for all es.) Absent this 
regularity condition, the optimization problem seems quite difficult
because it is so general: we need to maximize expected 
revenue over the space of all functions g.
To simplify matters, we now restrict our attention to the
family of weights ws = eq
s for q ∈ (−∞, +∞). It should be
much simpler to find the optimum within this family, since
it is just one-dimensional. Note that it covers rank-by-bid
(q = 0) and rank-by-revenue (q = 1) as special cases.
To see how tuning q can improve matters, consider again
the equilibrium revenue:

If the bidders are ranked in decreasing order of relevance,
then et

≤ 1 for t > s and decreasing q slightly without
affecting the allocation will increase revenue. Similarly, if
bidders are ranked in increasing order of relevance, 
increasing q slightly will yield an improvement. Now suppose there
is perfect positive correlation between value and relevance.
In this case, rank-by-bid will always lead to the same 
allocation as rank-by-revenue, and bidders will always be ranked
in decreasing order of relevance. It then follows from (7) that
q = 0 will yield more revenue in equilibrium than q = 1.5
5
It may appear that this contradicts the revenue-equivalence
theorem [7, 9], because mechanisms that always lead to the
same allocation in equilibrium should yield the same 
revenue. Note though that with perfect correlation, there are
If a good estimate of f is available, Monte-Carlo 
simulations can be used to estimate the revenue curve as a function
of q, and the optimum can be located. Simulations can also
be used to quantify the effect of correlation on the location
of the optimum. We do this in Section 7.
