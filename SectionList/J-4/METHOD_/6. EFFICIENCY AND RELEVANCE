In principle the revenue-optimal parameter q may lie 
anywhere in (−∞, ∞). However, tuning the ranking rule also
has consequences for advertiser satisfaction and user 
experience, and taking these into account reduces the range of
allowable q.
The total relevance of the equilibrium allocation is
L(q) =
KX
s=1
esxs,
i.e. the aggregate click-through rate. Presumably users find
the ad display more interesting and less of a nuisance if
they are more inclined to click on the ads, so we adopt total
relevance as a measure of user experience.
Let ps =
ws+1
ws
bs+1 be the price per click faced by bidder
s. The total value (efficiency) generated by the auction in
equilibrium is
V (q) =
KX
s=1
esxsvs
=
KX
s=1
esxs(vs − ps) +
KX
s=1
esxsps.
As we see total value can be reinterpreted as total profits
to the bidders and auctioneer combined. Since we only 
consider deviations from maximum efficiency that increase the
auctioneer"s profits, any decrease in efficiency in our setting
corresponds to a decrease in bidder profits. We therefore
adopt efficiency as a measure of advertiser satisfaction.
We would expect total relevance to increase with q, since
more weight is placed on each bidder"s individual relevance.
We would expect efficiency to be maximized at q = 1, since
in this case a bidder"s weight is exactly his relevance.
Proposition 1. Total relevance is non-decreasing in q.
Proof. Recall that in symmetric equilibrium, bidders are
ranked in order of decreasing wsvs. Let > 0. Perform an
exchange sort to obtain the ranking that arises with q +
starting from the ranking that arises with q (for a description
of exchange sort and its properties, see Knuth [6] pp. 
106110). Assume that is large enough to make the rankings
distinct. Agents s and t, where s is initially ranked lower
than t, are swapped in the process if and only if the following
conditions hold:
eq
svs ≤ eq
t vt
eq+
s vs > eq+
t vt
which together imply that es > et and hence es > et as
> 0. At some point in the sort, agent s occupies some slot
α, β such that vs = αes + β. So the assumption of full 
support is violated, which is necessary for revenue equivalence.
Recall that a density has full support over a given domain
if every point in the domain has positive density.

k while agent t occupies slot k − 1. After the swap, total
relevance will have changed by the amount
esxk−1 + etxk − etxk−1 − esxk
= (es − et)(xk−1 − xk) > 0
As relevance strictly increases with each swap in the sort,
total relevance is strictly greater when using q + rather
than q.
Proposition 2. Total value is non-decreasing in q for
q ≤ 1 and non-increasing in q for q ≥ 1.
Proof. Let q ≥ 1 and let > 0. Perform an exchange
sort to obtain the second ranking from the first as in the
previous proof. If agents s and t are swapped, where s was
initially ranked lower than t, then es > et. This follows by
the same reasoning as in the previous proof. Now e1−q
s ≤
e1−q
t as 1 − q ≤ 0. This together with eq
svs ≤ eq
t vt implies
that esvs ≤ etvt. Hence after swapping agents s and t, total
value has not increased. The case for q ≤ 1 is similar.
Since the trends described in Propositions 1 and 2 hold
pointwise (i.e. for any set of bidders), they also hold in 
expectation. Proposition 2 confirms that efficiency is indeed
maximized at q = 1.
These results motivate the following approach. Although
tuning q can optimize current revenue, this may come at the
price of future revenue because advertisers and users may
be lost, seeing as their satisfaction decreases. To guarantee
future revenue will not be hurt too much, the auctioneer
can impose bounds on the percent efficiency and relevance
loss he is willing to tolerate, with q = 1 being a natural
baseline. By Proposition 2, a lower bound on efficiency will
yield upper and lower bounds on the search space for q. By
Proposition 1, a lower bound on relevance will yield another
lower bound on q. The revenue curve can then be plotted
within the allowable range of q to find the revenue-optimal
setting.
