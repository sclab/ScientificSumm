In this work we looked into the revenue properties of a
family of ranking rules that contains the Yahoo! and Google
models as special cases. In practice, it should be very 
simple to move between rules within the family: this simply 
involves changing the exponent q applied to advertiser effects.
We also showed that, in principle, the same effect could be
obtained by using bidding credits. Despite the simplicity
of the rule change, simulations revealed that properly 
tuning q can significantly improve revenue. In the simulations,
the revenue improvements were greater than what could be
obtained using reserve prices.
On the other hand, we showed that advertiser 
satisfaction and user experience could suffer if q is made too small.
We proposed that the auctioneer set bounds on the decrease
in advertiser and user satisfaction he is willing to tolerate,
which would imply bounds on the range of allowable q. With
appropriate estimates for the distributions of value and 
relevance, and knowledge of their correlation, the revenue curve
can then be plotted within this range to locate the optimum.
There are several ways to push this research further. It
would be interesting to do this analysis for a variety of 
keywords, to see if the optimal setting of q is always so sensitive
to the level of correlation. If it is, then simply using 
rank-bybid where there is positive correlation, and rank-by-revenue
where there is negative correlation, could be fine to a first 
approximation and already improve revenue. It would also be
interesting to compare the effects of tuning q versus reserve
pricing for keywords that have few bidders. In this instance
reserve pricing should be more competitive, but this is still
an open question.
In principle the minimum revenue in Nash equilibrium
can be found by linear programming. However, many 
allocations can arise in Nash equilibrium, and a linear program
needs to be solved for each of these. There is as yet no
efficient way to enumerate all possible Nash allocations, so
finding the minimum revenue is currently infeasible. If this
problem could be solved, we could run simulations for Nash
equilibrium instead of symmetric equilibrium, to see if our
insights are robust to the choice of solution concept.
Larger classes of ranking rules could be relevant. For 
instance, it is possible to introduce discounts ds and rank 
according to wsbs âˆ’ ds; the equilibrium analysis generalizes to
this case as well. With this larger class the virtual score
can equal the score, e.g. in the case of a uniform marginal
distribution over values. It is unclear, though, whether such
extensions help with more realistic distributions.
