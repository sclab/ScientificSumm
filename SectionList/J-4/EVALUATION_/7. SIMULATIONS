To add a measure of reality to our simulations, we fit
distributions for value and relevance to Yahoo! bid and 
clickthrough rate data for a certain keyword that draws over a
million searches per month. (We do not reveal the identity
of the keyword to respect the privacy of the advertisers.)
We obtained click and impression data for the advertisers
bidding on the keyword. From this we estimated advertiser
and position effects using a maximum-likelihood criterion.
We found that, indeed, position effects are monotonically
decreasing with lower rank. We then fit a beta distribution
to the advertiser effects resulting in parameters a = 2.71
and b = 25.43.
We obtained bids of advertisers for the keyword. Using
Varian"s [11] technique, we derived bounds on the bidders"
actual values given these bids. By this technique, upper and
lower bounds are obtained on bidder values given the bids
according to inequality (3). If the interval for a given value is
empty, i.e. its upper bound lies below its lower bound, then
we compute the smallest perturbation to the bids necessary
to make the interval non-empty, which involves solving a
quadratic program. We found that the mean absolute 
deviation required to fit bids to symmetric equilibrium was

always at most 0.08, and usually significantly less, over 
different days in a period of two weeks.6
We fit a lognormal
distribution to the lower bounds on the bidders" values, 
resulting in parameters μ = 0.35 and σ = 0.71.
The empirical distributions of value and relevance together
with the fitted lognormal and beta curves are given in 
Figure 1. It appears that mixtures of beta and lognormal 
distributions might be better fits, but since these distributions
are used mainly for illustration purposes, we err on the side
of simplicity.
We used a Gaussian copula to create dependence between
value and relevance.7
Given the marginal distributions for
value and relevance together with this copula, we simulated
the revenue effect of varying q for different levels of 
Spearman correlation, with 12 slots and 13 bidders. The results
are shown in Figure 2.8
It is apparent from the figure that the optimal choice of q
moves to the right as correlation decreases; this agrees with
our intuition from Section 5. The choice is very sensitive
to the level of correlation. If choosing only between 
rankby-bid and rank-by-revenue, rank-by-bid is best for positive
correlation whereas rank-by-revenue is best for negative 
correlation. At zero correlation, they give about the same 
expected revenue in this instance. Figure 2 also shows that
in principle, the optimal q may be negative. It may also
occur beyond 1 for different distributions, but we do not
know if these would be realistic. The trends in efficiency
and relevance are as described in the results from Section 6.
(Any small deviation from these trends is due to the 
randomness inherent in the simulations.) The curves level off
as q → +∞ because eventually agents are ranked purely
according to relevance, and similarly as q → −∞.
A typical Spearman correlation between value and 
relevance for the keyword was about 0.4-for different days in
a week the correlation lay within [0.36, 0.55]. Simulation 
results with this correlation are in Figure 3. In this instance
rank-by-bid is in fact optimal, yielding 25% more revenue
than rank-by-revenue. However, at q = 0 efficiency and 
relevance are 9% and 17% lower than at q = 1, respectively.
Imposing a bound of, say, 5% on efficiency and relevance loss
from the baseline at q = 1, the optimal setting is q = 0.6,
yielding 11% more revenue than the baseline.

A copula is a function that takes marginal distributions
and gives a joint distribution with these marginals. It can
be designed so that the variables are correlated. See for
example Nelsen [10].

The y-axes in Figures 2-4 have been normalized because
the simulations are based on proprietary data. Only relative
values are meaningful.

of 0.4. Estimated standard errors are less than 1% of the values shown.
We also looked into the effect of introducing a reserve
score. Results are shown in Figure 4. Naturally, both 
efficiency and relevance suffer with an increasing reserve score.
The optimal setting is r = 0.2, which gives only an 8% 
increase in revenue from r = 0. However, it results in a 13%
efficiency loss and a 26% relevance loss. Tuning weights
seems to be a much more desirable approach than 
introducing a reserve score in this instance.
The reason why efficiency and relevance suffer more with
a reserve score is that this approach will often exclude 
bidders entirely, whereas this never occurs when tuning weights.
The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, however,
and some combination of the two might prove better than
either alone, although we did not investigate this possibility.
