ANSWERING
Definitional Question Answering was first introduced to the TExt
Retrieval Conference Question Answering Track main task in 2003.
The Definition questions, also called Other questions in recent years,
are defined as follows. Given a question topic X, the task of a 
definitional QA system is akin to answering the question What is X?
or Who is X?. The definitional QA system is to search through
a news corpus and return return a set of answers that best describes
the question topic. Each answer should be a unique topic-specific
nugget that makes up one facet in the definition of the question
topic.
1.1 The Two Aspects of Topic Nuggets
Officially, topic-specific answer nuggets or simply topic nuggets
are described as informative nuggets. Each informative nugget is
a sentence fragment that describe some factual information about
the topic. Depending on the topic type and domain, this can include
topic properties, relationships the topic has with some closely 
related entity, or events that happened to the topic.
From observation of the answer set for definitional question 
answering from TREC 2003 to 2005, it seems that a significant 
number of topic nuggets cannot simply be described as informative
nuggets. Rather, these topic nuggets have a trivia-like quality 
associated with them. Typically, these are out of the ordinary pieces
of information about a topic that can pique a human reader"s 
interest. For this reason, we decided to define answer nuggets that
can evoke human interest as interesting nuggets. In essence, 
interesting nuggets answer the questions What is X famous for?,
What defines X? or What is extraordinary about X?.
We now have two very different perspective as to what 
constitutes an answer to Definition questions. An answer can be some
important factual information about the topic or some novel and
interesting aspect about the topic. This duality of informativeness
and interestingness can be clearly observed in the five vital answer
nuggets for a TREC 2005 topic of George Foreman. Certain 
answer nuggets are more informative while other nuggets are more
interesting in nature.
Informative Nuggets
- Was graduate of Job Corps.
- Became oldest world champion in boxing history.
Interesting Nuggets
- Has lent his name to line of food preparation products.
- Waved American flag after winning 1968 Olympics championship.
- Returned to boxing after 10 yr hiatus.
As an African-American professional heavyweight boxer, an 
average human reader would find the last three nuggets about George
Foreman interesting because boxers do not usually lend their names
to food preparation products, nor do boxers retire for 10 years 
before returning to the ring and become the world"s oldest boxing
champion. Foreman"s waving of the American flag at the Olympics
is interesting because the innocent action caused some 
AfricanAmericans to accuse Foreman of being an Uncle Tom. As seen
here, interesting nuggets has some surprise factor or unique quality
that makes them interesting to human readers.
1.2 Identifying Interesting Nuggets
Since the original official description for definitions comprise of
identifying informative nuggets, most research has focused entirely
on identifying informative nuggets. In this paper, we focus on 
exploring the properties of interesting nuggets and develop ways of
identify such interesting nuggets. A Human Interest Model 
definitional question answering system is developed with emphasis
on identifying interesting nuggets in order to evaluate the impact
of interesting nuggets on the performance of a definitional 
question answering system. We further experimented with combining
the Human Interest Model with a lexical pattern based definitional
question answering system in order to capture both informative and
interesting nuggets.
