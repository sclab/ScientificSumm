The GSP auction is not the only possible auction one
could use for sponsored search. Indeed the VCG auction
and variants [14, 4, 7, 1] offer alternatives with compelling
game-theoretic properties. In this section we argue that
the budget optimization problem is easy under the VCG
auction.
For a full definition of VCG and its application to 
sponsored search we refer the reader to [1, 2, 5]. For the sake
of the budget optimization problem we can define VCG by
just redefining costq(b) (replacing Equation (2)):
costq(b) =
p−1
X
j=i
(α[j] − α[j + 1]) · b[j] where i = pos(b).
Observation 1 still holds, and we can construct a landscape
as before, where each landscape point corresponds to a 
particular bid b[i].
We claim that in the VCG auction, the landscapes are 
convex. To see this, consider two consecutive positions i,i + 1.
The slope of line segment between the points corresponding
to those two positions is
cost(b[i]) − cost(b[i + 1])
clicks(b[i]) − clicks(b[i + 1])
=
(α[i] − α[i + 1]) · b[i]
α[i] − α[i + 1]
= b[i].
Since b[i] ≥ b[i + 1], the slopes of the pieces of the 
landscape decrease, and we get that the curve is convex.
Now consider running the algorithm described in 
Section 2.1.4 for finding the optimal bids for a set of queries.
In this algorithm we took all the pieces from the landscape
curves, sorted them by incremental cpc, then took a prefix
of those pieces, giving us bids for each of the queries. But,
the equation above shows that each piece has its 
incremental cpc equal to the bid that achieves it; thus in the case of
VCG the pieces are also sorted by bid. Hence we can obtain
any prefix of the pieces via a uniform bid on all the 
keywords. We conclude that the best uniform bid is an optimal
solution to the budget optimization problem.
