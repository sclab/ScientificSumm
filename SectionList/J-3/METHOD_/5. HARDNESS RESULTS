By a reduction from vertex cover we can show the 
following (proof omitted):

Now suppose we introduce weights on the queries that
indicate the relative value of a click from the various search
users. Formally, we have weights wq for all q ∈ Q and our
goal is maximize the total weighted traffic given a budget.
Call this the Weighted Keyword Bidding problem.
With this additional generalization we can show hardness
of approximation via a simple reduction from the Maximum
Coverage problem, which is known to be (1−1/e)-hard [6]
(proof omitted).
Theorem 8. The Weighted Keyword Bidding 
problem is hard to approximate to within (1 − 1/e).
