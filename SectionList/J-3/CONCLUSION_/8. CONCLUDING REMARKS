Our algorithmic result presents an intriguing heuristic in
practice: bid a single value b on all keywords; at the end of
the day, if the budget is under-spent, adjust b to be higher;
if budget is overspent, adjust b to be lower; else, maintain
b. If the scenario does not change from day to day, this
simple strategy will have the same theoretical properties as
our one-bid strategy, and in practice, is likely to be much
better. Of course the scenario does change, however, and so
coming up with a stochastic bidding strategy remains an
important open direction, explored somewhat by [11, 13].
Another interesting generalization is to consider weights
on the clicks, which is a way to model conversions. (A 
conversion corresponds to an action on the part of the user who
clicked through to the advertiser site; e.g., a sale or an 
account sign-up.) Finally, we have looked at this system as a
black box returning clicks as a function of bid, whereas in
reality it is a complex repeated game involving multiple 
advertisers. In [3], it was shown that when a set of advertisers
use a strategy similar to the one we suggest here, under a
slightly modified first-price auction, the prices approach a
well-understood market equilibrium.
