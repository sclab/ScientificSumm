In this paper we suggest a way to deal with the 
impossibility of producing mechanisms which are efficient, 
individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced.
To this aim we introduce the concept of negotiation-range
mechanisms which avoid the problem by leaving the final
determination of prices to a negotiation between the buyer
and seller. The goal of the mechanism is to provide the 
initial range (ZOPA) for negotiation in a way that it will be
beneficial for the participants to close the proposed deals.
We present a negotiation range mechanism that is efficient,
individually rational, incentive compatible and budget 
balanced. The ZOPA produced by our mechanism is based
7
on a natural adaptation of the VCG payment scheme in a
way that promises valid negotiation ranges which permit a
budget balanced allocation.
The basic question that we aimed to tackle seems very
exciting: which properties can we expect a market 
mechanism to achieve ? Are there different market models and
requirements from the mechanisms that are more feasible
than classic mechanism design goals ?
In the context of our negotiation-range model, is 
natural to further study negotiation based mechanisms in more
general settings. A natural extension is that of a 
combinatorial market. Unfortunately, finding the optimal allocation
in a combinatorial setting is NP-hard, and thus the problem
of maintaining BB is compounded by the problem of 
maintaining IC when efficiency is approximated [1, 5, 6, 9, 11].
Applying the approach in this paper to develop 
negotiationrange mechanisms for combinatorial markets, even in 
restricted settings, seems a promising direction for research.
