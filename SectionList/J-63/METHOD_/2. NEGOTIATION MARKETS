PRELIMINARIES
Let Π denote the set of players, N the set of n 
selling players, and M the set of m buying players, where
Π = N ∪ M. Let Ψ = {1, ..., t} denote the set of goods.
Let Ti ∈ {−1, 0, 1}t
denote an exchange vector for a trade,
such that player i buys goods {A ∈ Ψ|Ti (A) = 1} and sells
goods {A ∈ Ψ|Ti (A) = −1}. Let T = (T1, ..., T|Π|) denote
the complete trade between all players. We view T as 
describing the allocation of goods by the mechanism to the
buyers and sellers.
In the single-unit heterogeneous setting every good 
belongs to specific seller, and every buyer is interested in 
buying one good. The buyer may bid for several or all goods.
At the end of the auction every good is either assigned to
one of the buyers who bid for it or kept unsold by the seller.
It is convenient to assume the sets of buyers and sellers are
disjoint (though it is not required), i.e. N ∩ M = ∅. Each
seller i is associated with exactly one good Ai, for which she
has true valuation ci which expresses the price at which it
is beneficial for her to sell the good. If the seller reports a
false valuation at an attempt to improve the auction results
for her, this valuation is denoted ˆci. A buyer has a 
valuation vector describing his valuation for each of the goods
according to their owner. Specifically, vj(k) denotes buyer
j"s valuation for good Ak. Similarly, if he reports a false
valuation it is denoted ˆvj(k).
If buyer j is matched by the mechanism with seller i then
Ti(Ai) = −1 and Tj(Ai) = 1. Notice, that in our setting for
every k = i, Ti(Ak) = 0 and Tj(Ai) = 0 and also for every
z = j, Tz(Ai) = 0.
For a matched buyer j - seller i pair, the gain from trade
on the deal is defined as vj(i) − ci. Given and allocation T,
the gain from trade associated with T is
V =
j∈M,i∈N
(vj(i) − ci) · Tj(Ai).
Let T∗
denote the optimal allocation which maximizes the
gain from trade, computed according to the players" true
valuations. Let V ∗
denote the optimal gain from trade 
associated with this allocation.
When players" report false valuations we use ˆT∗
and ˆV ∗
to
denote the optimal allocation and gain from trade, 
respectively, when computed according to the reported valuations.

We are interested in the design of negotiation-range 
mechanisms. In contrast to a standard auction mechanism where
the buyer and seller are provided with the prices they should
pay, the goal of a negotiation-range mechanism is to provide
the player"s with a range of prices within which they can
negotiate the final terms of the deal by themselves. The
mechanism would provide the buyer with the upper bound
on the range and the seller with the lower bound on the
range. This gives each of them a promise that it will be
beneficial for them to close the deal, but does not provide
information about the other player"s terms of negotiation.
Definition 1. Negotiation Range: Zone Of Possible 
Agreements, ZOPA, between a matched buyer and seller. The
ZOPA is a range, (L, H), 0 ≤ L ≤ H, where H is an upper
bound (ceiling) price for the buyer and L is a lower bound
(floor) price for the seller.
Definition 2. Negotiation-Range Mechanism: A 
mechanism that computes a ZOPA, (L, H), for each matched buyer
and seller in T∗
, and provides the buyer with the upper bound
H and the seller with the lower bound L.
The basic assumption is that participants in the auction
are self-interested players. That is their main goal is to
maximize their expected utility. The utility for a buyer who
does not participate in the trade is 0. If he does win some
good, his utility is the surplus between his valuation for that
good and the price he pays. For a seller, if she keeps the good
unsold, her utility is just her valuation of the good, and the
surplus is 0. If she gets to sell it, her utility is the price she
is paid for it, and the surplus is the difference between this
price and her valuation.
Since negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the
range of prices rather than the final price, it is useful to
define the upper and lower bounds on the player"s utilities
defined by the range"s limits.
Definition 3. Consider a buyer j - seller i pair matched
by a negotiation-range mechanism and let (L, H) be their
associated negotiation range.
• The buyer"s top utility is: vj(i) − L, and the buyer"s
bottom utility is vj(i) − H.
• The seller"s top utility is H, with surplus H − ci, and
the seller"s bottom utility is L, with surplus L − ci.
