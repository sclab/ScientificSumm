MECHANISM (ZOPAS)
3.1 Description of the Mechanism
ZOPAS is a negotiation-range mechanism, it finds the 
optimal allocation T∗
and uses it to define a ZOPA for each
buyer-seller pair.
The first stage in applying the mechanism is for the buyers
and sellers to submit their sealed bids. The mechanism then
allocates buyers to sellers by computing the allocation T ∗
,
which results in the optimal gain from trade V ∗
, and defines
a ZOPA for each buyer-seller pair. Finally, buyers and sellers
use the ZOPA to negotiate a final price.
Computing T∗
involves solving the maximum weighted 
bipartite matching problem for the complete bipartite graph

graph, the seller on another and giving the edge between
buyer j and seller i weight equal to vj(i) − ci. The 
maximum weighted matching problem in solvable in polynomial
time (e.g., using the Hungarian Method). This results in
a matching between buyers and sellers that maximizes gain
from trade.
The next step is to compute for each buyer-seller pair a
seller"s floor, which provides the lower bound of the ZOPA
for this pair, and assigns it to the seller.
A seller"s floor is computed by calculating the difference
between the total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded
and the total gain from trade of the other participants when
the buyer is included (the VCG principle).
Let (T−j)∗
denote the gain from trade of the optimal 
allocation when buyer j"s bids are discarded. Denote by (V−j)∗
the total gain from trade in the allocation (T−j)∗
.
Definition 4. Seller Floor: The lowest price the seller
should expect to receive, communicated to the seller by the
mechanism. The seller floor for player i who was matched
with buyer j on good Ai, i.e., Tj(Ai) = 1, is computed as:
Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗
− V ∗
.
The seller is instructed not to accept less than this price from
her matched buyer.
Next, the mechanism computes for each buyer-seller pair a
buyer ceiling, which provides the upper bound of the ZOPA
for this pair, and assigns it to the buyer.
Each buyer"s ceiling is computed by removing the buyer"s
matched seller and calculating the difference between the
total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded and the
total gain from trade of the other participants when the
3
buyer is included. Let (T−i
)∗
denote the gain from trade
of the optimal allocation when seller i is removed from the
trade. Denote by (V −i
)∗
the total gain from trade in the
allocation (T−i
)∗
.
Let (T−i
−j )∗
denote the gain from trade of the optimal 
allocation when seller i is removed from the trade and buyer j"s
bids are discarded. Denote by (V −i
−j )∗
the total gain from
trade in the allocation (T −i
−j )∗
.
Definition 5. Buyer Ceiling: The highest price the seller
should expect to pay, communicated to the buyer by the 
mechanism. The buyer ceiling for player j who was matched with
seller i on good Ai, i.e., Tj(Ai) = 1, is computed as:
Hj = vj(i) + (V −i
−j )∗
− (V −i
)∗
.
The buyer is instructed not to pay more than this price to
his matched seller.
Once the negotiation range lower bound and upper bound
are computed for every matched pair, the mechanism reports
the lower bound price to the seller and the upper bound price
to the buyer. At this point each buyer-seller pair negotiates
on the final price and concludes the deal.
A schematic description the ZOPAS mechanism is given
in Figure 3.1.
3.2 Analysis of the Mechanism
In this section we analyze the properties of the ZOPAS
mechanism.
Theorem 1. The ZOPAS market negotiation-range 
mechanism is an incentive-compatible bilateral trade 
mechanism that is efficient, individually rational and budget
balanced.
Clearly ZOPAS is an efficient polynomial time mechanism.
Let us show it satisfies the rest of the properties in the 
theorem.
Claim 1. ZOPAS is individually rational, i.e., the 
mechanism maintains nonnegative utility surplus for all 
participants.
Proof. If a participant does not trade in the optimal
allocation then his utility surplus is zero by definition. 
Consider a pair of buyer j and seller i which are matched in the
optimal allocation T ∗
. Then the buyer"s utility is at least
vj(i) − Hj. Recall that Hj = vj(i) + (V −i
−j )∗
− (V −i
)∗
, so
that vj(i) − Hj = (V −i
)∗
− (V −i
−j )∗
. Since the optimal gain
from trade which includes j is higher than that which does
not, we have that the utility is nonnegative: vj(i) − Hj ≥ 0.
Now, consider the seller i. Her utility surplus is at least
Li − ci. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗
− V ∗
. If we 
removed from the optimal allocation T ∗
the contribution of
the buyer j - seller i pair, we are left with an allocation
which excludes j, and has value V ∗
− (vj(i) − ci). This
implies that (V−j)∗
≥ V ∗
− vj(i) + ci, which implies that
Li − ci ≥ 0.
The fact that ZOPAS is a budget-balanced mechanism
follows from the following lemma which ensures the validity
of the negotiation range, i.e., that every seller"s floor is below
her matched buyer"s ceiling. This ensures that they can close
the deal at a final price which lies in this range.
Lemma 1. For every buyer j- seller i pair matched by the
mechanism: Li ≤ Hj.
Proof. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗
− V ∗
and Hj =
vj(i)+(V −i
−j )∗
−(V −i
)∗
. To prove that Li ≤ Hj it is enough
to show that
(V −i
)∗
+ (V−j)∗
≤ V ∗
+ (V −i
−j )∗
. (1)
The proof of (1) is based on a method which we apply
several times in our analysis. We start with the 
allocations (T−i
)∗
and (T−j)∗
which together have value equal
to (V −i
)∗
+ (V−j)∗
. We now use them to create a pair of
new valid allocations, by using the same pairs that were
matched in the original allocations. This means that the
sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the 
original pair of allocations. We also require that one of the new
allocations does not include buyer j or seller i. This means
that the sum of values of these new allocations is at most
V ∗
+ (V −i
−j )∗
, which proves (1).
Let G be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side
of G represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side
represent the sellers, and edge weights represent the gain
from trade for the particular pair. The different allocations
represent bipartite matchings in G. It will be convenient for
the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong
to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific
color representing this matching.
Assign color 1 to the edges in the matching (T −i
)∗
and
assign color 2 to the edges in the matching (T−j)∗
. We claim
that these edges can be recolored using colors 3 and 4 so that
the new coloring represents allocations T (represented by
color 3) and (T−i
−j ) (represented by color 4). This implies
the that inequality (1) holds. Figure 2 illustrates the graph
G and the colorings of the different matchings.
Define an alternating path P starting at j. Let S1 be
the seller matched to j in (T −i
)∗
(if none exists then P is
empty). Let B1 be the buyer matched to S1 in (T−j)∗
, S2 be
the seller matched to B1 in (T−i
)∗
, B2 be the buyer matched
to S2 in (T−j)∗
, and so on. This defines an alternating
path P, starting at j, whose edges" colors alternate between
colors 1 and 2 (starting with 1). This path ends either in a
seller who is not matched in (T−j)∗
or in a buyer who is not
matched in (T−i
)∗
. Since all sellers in this path are matched
in (T−i
)∗
, we have that seller i does not belong to P. This
ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors
3 and 4 (starting with 3). Since except for the first edge, all
others do not involve i or j and thus may be colored 4 and
be part of an allocation (T −i
−j ) .
We are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to P.
Since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges
that were colored 1, which are part of (T −i
)∗
, may now be
colored 4, and be included in the allocation (T −i
−j ) . It is
also clear that the edges that were colored 2, which are part
of (T−j)∗
, may now be colored 3, and be included in the
allocation T . This completes the proof of the lemma.
3.3 Incentive Compatibility
The basic requirement in mechanism design is for an 
exchange mechanism to be incentive compatible. This means
that its payment structure enforces that truth-telling is the
players" weakly dominant strategy, that is that the 
strategy by which the player is stating his true valuation results

in bigger or equal utility as any other strategy. The 
utility surplus is defined as the absolute difference between the
player"s bid and his price.
Negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the range
of prices rather than the final price and therefore the player"s
valuation only influences the minimum and maximum bounds
on his utility. For a buyer the minimum (bottom) utility
would be based on the top of the negotiation range 
(ceiling), and the maximum (top) utility would be based on the
bottom of the negotiation range (floor). For a seller it"s the
other way around. Therefore the basic natural requirement
from negotiation-range mechanisms would be that stating
the player"s true valuation results in both the higher 
bottom utility and higher top utility for the player, compared
with other strategies. Unfortunately, this requirement is
still too strong and it is impossible (by [10]) that this will
always hold. Therefore we slightly relax it as follows: we
require this holds when the false valuation based strategy
changes the player"s allocation. When the allocation stays
unchanged we require instead that the player would not be
able to change his matched player"s bound (e.g. a buyer
cannot change the seller"s floor). This means that the only
thing he can influence is his own bound, something that he
can alternatively achieve through means of negotiation.
The following formally summarizes our incentive 
compatibility requirements from the negotiation-range mechanism.
Buyer"s incentive compatibility:
• Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the 
mechanism according to valuation vj and the 
negotiationrange assigned is (Li, Hj). Assume that when the
mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, seller
k = i is matched with j and the negotiation-range
assigned is (ˆLk, ˆHj). Then
vj(i) − Hj ≥ vj(k) − ˆHj. (2)
vj(i) − Li ≥ vj(k) − ˆLk. (3)
• Let j be a buyer not matched by the mechanism 
according to valuation vj. Assume that when the 
mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, seller k = i
is matched with j and the negotiation-range assigned
is (ˆLk, ˆHj). Then
vj(k) − ˆHj ≤ vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0. (4)
• Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the 
mechanism according to valuation vj and let the assigned
bottom of the negotiation range (seller"s floor) be Li.
Assume that when the mechanism is applied according
to valuation ˆvj, the matching between i and j remains
unchanged and let the assigned bottom of the 
negotiation range (seller"s floor) be ˆLi. Then,
ˆLi = Li. (5)
Notice that the first inequality of (4) always holds for a valid
negotiation range mechanism (Lemma 1).
Seller"s incentive compatibility:
• Let i be a seller not matched by the mechanism 
according to valuation ci. Assume that when the mechanism
5
is applied according to valuation ˆci, buyer z = j is
matched with i and the negotiation-range assigned is
(ˆLi, ˆHz). Then
ˆLi − ci ≤ ˆHz − ci ≤ 0. (6)
• Let i be a buyer matched with buyer j by the 
mechanism according to valuation ci and let the assigned top
of the negotiation range (buyer"s ceiling) be Hj. 
Assume that when the mechanism is applied according
to valuation ˆci, the matching between i and j remains
unchanged and let the assigned top of the negotiation
range (buyer"s ceiling) be ˆHj. Then,
ˆHj = Hj. (7)
Notice that the first inequality of (6) always holds for a valid
negotiation range mechanism (Lemma 1).
Observe that in the case of sellers in our setting, the case
expressed by requirement (6) is the only case in which the
seller may change the allocation to her benefit. In particular,
it is not possible for seller i who is matched in T ∗
to change
her buyer by reporting a false valuation. This fact simply
follows from the observation that reducing the seller"s 
valuation increases the gain from trade for the current allocation
by at least as much than any other allocation, whereas 
increasing the seller"s valuation decreases the gain from trade
for the current allocation by exactly the same amount as any
other allocation in which it is matched. Therefore, the only
case the optimal allocation may change is when in the new
allocation i is not matched in which case her utility surplus
is 0.
Theorem 2. ZOPAS is an incentive compatible 
negotiationrange mechanism.
Proof. We begin with the incentive compatibility for
buyers.
Consider a buyer j who is matched with seller i according
to his true valuation v. Consider that j is reporting instead
a false valuation ˆv which results in a different allocation in
which j is matched with seller k = i. The following claim
shows that a buyer j which changed his allocation due to
a false declaration of his valuation cannot improve his top
utility.
Claim 2. Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗
, and
let k = i be the seller matched to j in ˆT∗
. Then,
vj(i) − Hj ≥ vj(k) − ˆHj. (8)
Proof. Recall that Hj = vj(i) + (V −i
−j )∗
− (V −i
)∗
and
ˆHj = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV −k
−j )∗
− ( ˆV −k
)∗
. Therefore, vj(i) − Hj =
(V −i
)∗
− (V −i
−j )∗
and vj(k) − ˆHj = vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV −k
)∗
−
( ˆV −k
−j )∗
.
It follows that in order to prove (8) we need to show
( ˆV −k
)∗
+ (V −i
−j )∗
≤ (V −i
)∗
+ ( ˆV −k
−j )∗
+ ˆvj(k) − vj(k). (9)
Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k
)∗
. If
we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain
a matching which excludes i, if the gain from trade on the
new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we
get
( ˆV −k
)∗
− (ˆvj(i) − ci) + (vj(k) − ck) ≤ (V −i
)∗
.
Now, since the optimal allocation ˆT∗
matches j with k rather
than with i we have that
(V −i
−j )∗
+ (ˆvj(i) − ci) ≤ ˆV ∗
= ( ˆV −k
−j )∗
+ (ˆvj(k) − ck),
where we have used that ( ˆV −i
−j )∗
= (V −i
−j )∗
since these 
allocations exclude j. Adding up these two inequalities implies
(9) in this case.
It is left to prove (9) when j is not matched to i in ( ˆT−k
)∗
.
In fact, in this case we prove the stronger inequality
( ˆV −k
)∗
+ (V −i
−j )∗
≤ (V −i
)∗
+ ( ˆV −k
−j )∗
. (10)
It is easy to see that (10) indeed implies (9) since it follows
from the fact that k is assigned to j in ˆT∗
that ˆvj(k) ≥
vj(k). The proof of (10) works as follows. We start with the
allocations ( ˆT−k
)∗
and (T−i
−j )∗
which together have value
equal to ( ˆV −k
)∗
+ (V −i
−j )∗
. We now use them to create a
pair of new valid allocations, by using the same pairs that
were matched in the original allocations. This means that
the sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the
original pair of allocations. We also require that one of the
new allocations does not include seller i and is based on the
true valuation v, while the other allocation does not include
buyer j or seller k and is based on the false valuation ˆv. This
means that the sum of values of these new allocations is at
most (V −i
)∗
+ ( ˆV −k
−j )∗
, which proves (10).
Let G be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side
of G represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side
represent the sellers, and edge weights represent the gain
from trade for the particular pair. The different allocations
represent bipartite matchings in G. It will be convenient for
the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong
to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific
color representing this matching.
Assign color 1 to the edges in the matching ( ˆT−k
)∗
and
assign color 2 to the edges in the matching (T −i
−j )∗
. We claim
that these edges can be recolored using colors 3 and 4 so that
the new coloring represents allocations (T −i
) (represented
by color 3) and ( ˆT−k
−j ) (represented by color 4). This implies
the that inequality (10) holds. Figure 2 illustrates the graph
G and the colorings of the different matchings.
Define an alternating path P starting at j. Let S1 = i be
the seller matched to j in ( ˆT−k
)∗
(if none exists then P is
empty). Let B1 be the buyer matched to S1 in (T−i
−j )∗
, S2 be
the seller matched to B1 in ( ˆT−k
)∗
, B2 be the buyer matched
to S2 in (T−i
−j )∗
, and so on. This defines an alternating
path P, starting at j, whose edges" colors alternate between
colors 1 and 2 (starting with 1). This path ends either in
a seller who is not matched in (T −i
−j )∗
or in a buyer who
is not matched in ( ˆT−k
)∗
. Since all sellers in this path are
matched in ( ˆT−k
)∗
, we have that seller k does not belong to
P. Since in this case S1 = i and the rest of the sellers in P
are matched in (T−i
−j )∗
we have that seller i as well does not
belong to P. This ensures that edges in P may be colored
by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3). Since S1 = i,
we may use color 3 for the first edge and thus assign it to
the allocation (T−i
) . All other edges, do not involve i, j
or k and thus may be either colored 4 and be part of an
allocation ( ˆT−k
−j ) or colored 3 and be part of an allocation
(T−i
) , in an alternating fashion.
We are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to P.
Since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges
6
that were colored 1, which are part of ( ˆT−k
)∗
, may now be
colored 4, and be included in the allocation ( ˆT−k
−j ) . It is
also clear that the edges that were colored 2, which are part
of (T−i
−j )∗
, may now be colored 3, and be included in the
allocation (T−i
) . This completes the proof of (10) and the
claim.
The following claim shows that a buyer j which changed
his allocation due to a false declaration of his valuation 
cannot improve his bottom utility. The proof is basically the
standard VCG argument.
Claim 3. Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗
, and
k = i be the seller matched to j in ˆT∗
. Then,
vj(i) − Li ≥ vj(k) − ˆLk. (11)
Proof. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗
− V ∗
, and ˆLk =
ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV−j)∗
− ˆV ∗
= ˆvj(k) + (V−j)∗
− ˆV ∗
. Therefore,
vj(i) − Li = V ∗
− (V−j)∗
and vj(k) − ˆLk = vj(k) − ˆvj(k) +
ˆV ∗
− (V−j)∗
.
It follows that in order to prove (11) we need to show
V ∗
≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗
. (12)
The scenario of this claim occurs when j understates his
value for Ai or overstated his value for Ak. Consider these
two cases:
• ˆvj(k) > vj(k): Since Ak was allocated to j in the
allocation ˆT∗
we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗
according to the true valuation gives an allocation of
value U satisfying ˆV ∗
− ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗
.
• ˆvj(k) = vj(k) and ˆvj(i) < vj(i): In this case (12)
reduces to V ∗
≥ ˆV ∗
. Since j is not allocated i in ˆT∗
we have that ˆT∗
is an allocation that uses only true
valuations. From the optimality of T ∗
we conclude
that V ∗
≥ ˆV ∗
.
Another case in which a buyer may try to improve his
utility is when he does not win any good by stating his true
valuation. He may give a false valuation under which he
wins some good. The following claim shows that doing this
is not beneficial to him.
Claim 4. Let j be a buyer not matched in T ∗
, and 
assume seller k is matched to j in ˆT∗
. Then,
vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0.
Proof. The scenario of this claim occurs if j did not
buy in the truth-telling allocation and overstates his value
for Ak, ˆvj(k) > vj(k) in his false valuation. Recall that
ˆLk = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV−j)∗
− ˆV ∗
. Thus we need to show that
0 ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗
− (V−j)∗
. Since j is not allocated
in T∗
then (V−j)∗
= V ∗
. Since j is allocated Ak in ˆT∗
we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗
according to the
true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗
−
ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗
. Thus we can conclude that 0 ≥
vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗
− (V−j)∗
.
Finally, the following claim ensures that a buyer cannot
influence the floor bound of the ZOPA for the good he wins.
Claim 5. Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗
, and
assume that ˆT∗
= T∗
, then ˆLi = Li.
Proof. Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗
− V ∗
, and ˆLi =
ˆvj(i) + ( ˆV−j)∗
− ˆV ∗
= ˆvj(i) + (V−j)∗
− ˆV ∗
. Therefore we
need to show that ˆV ∗
= V ∗
+ ˆvj(i) − vj(i).
Since j is allocated Ai in T∗
, we have that using the 
allocation of T∗
according to the false valuation gives an allocation
of value U satisfying V ∗
− vj(i) + ˆvj(i) ≤ U ≤ ˆV ∗
. 
Similarly since j is allocated Ai in ˆT∗
, we have that using the
allocation of ˆT∗
according to the true valuation gives an 
allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗
− ˆvj(i)+vj(i) ≤ U ≤ V ∗
,
which together with the previous inequality completes the
proof.
This completes the analysis of the buyer"s incentive 
compatibility. We now turn to prove the seller"s incentive 
compatibility properties of our mechanism.
The following claim handles the case where a seller that
was not matched in T ∗
falsely understates her valuation such
that she gets matched n ˆT∗
.
Claim 6. Let i be a seller not matched in T ∗
, and assume
buyer z is matched to i in ˆT∗
. Then,
ˆHz − ci ≤ 0.
Proof. Recall that ˆHz = vz(i) + ( ˆV −i
−z )∗
− ( ˆV −i
)∗
.
Since i is not matched in T ∗
and ( ˆT−i
)∗
involves only true
valuations we have that ( ˆV −i
)∗
= V ∗
. Since i is matched
with z in ˆT∗
it can be obtained by adding the buyer z - seller
i pair to ( ˆT−i
−z)∗
. It follows that ˆV ∗
= ( ˆV −i
−z )∗
+ vz(i) − ˆci.
Thus, we have that ˆHz = ˆV ∗
+ ˆci − V ∗
. Now, since i is
matched in ˆT∗
, using this allocation according to the true
valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗
+ ˆci −
ci ≤ U ≤ V ∗
. Therefore ˆHz −ci = ˆV ∗
+ˆci −V ∗
−ci ≤ 0.
Finally, the following simple claim ensures that a seller
cannot influence the ceiling bound of the ZOPA for the good
she sells.
Claim 7. Let i be a seller matched to buyer j in T ∗
, and
assume that ˆT∗
= T∗
, then ˆHj = Hj.
Proof. Since ( ˆV −i
−j )∗
= (V −i
−j )∗
and ( ˆV −i
)∗
= (V −i
)∗
it
follows that
ˆHj = vj(i)+( ˆV −i
−j )∗
−( ˆV −i
)∗
= vj(i)+(V −i
−j )∗
−(V −i
)∗
= Hj.
