The scenarios considered in this work consist of a finite set
of agents where each agent has a task that can be carried
out by any element of a set of identical resources (service
providers). The agents simultaneously choose a subset of
the resources in order to perform their tasks, and their aim
is to maximize their own expected payoff, as described in
the sequel.
Let N be a set of n agents (n ∈ N), and let M be a set
of m resources (m ∈ N). Agent i ∈ N chooses a 
strategy σi ∈ Σi which is a (potentially empty) subset of the
resources. That is, Σi is the power set of the set of 
resources: Σi = P(M). Given a subset S ⊆ N of the agents,
the set of strategy combinations of the members of S is
denoted by ΣS = ×i∈SΣi, and the set of strategy 
combinations of the complement subset of agents is denoted by
Σ−S (Σ−S = ΣN S = ×i∈N SΣi). The set of pure strategy
profiles of all the agents is denoted by Σ (Σ = ΣN ).
Each resource is associated with a cost, c(·), and a 
failure probability, f(·), each of which depends on the 
number of agents who use this resource. We assume that the
failure probabilities of the resources are independent. Let
σ = (σ1, . . . , σn) ∈ Σ be a pure strategy profile. The
(m-dimensional) congestion vector that corresponds to σ is
hσ
= (hσ
e )e∈M , where hσ
e =
˛
˛{i ∈ N : e ∈ σi}
˛
˛. The 
failure probability of a resource e is a monotone nondecreasing
function f : {1, . . . , n} → [0, 1) of the congestion 
experienced by e. The cost of utilizing resource e is a function
c : {1, . . . , n} → R+ of the congestion experienced by e.
The outcome for agent i ∈ N is denoted by xi ∈ {S, F},
where S and F, respectively, indicate whether the task 
execution succeeded or failed. We say that the execution of
agent"s i task succeeds if the task of agent i is successfully
completed by at least one of the resources chosen by him.
The benefit of agent i from his outcome xi is denoted by
Vi(xi), where Vi(S) = vi, a given (nonnegative) value, and
Vi(F) = 0.
The utility of agent i from strategy profile σ and his 
outcome xi, ui(σ, xi), is the difference between his benefit from
the outcome (Vi(xi)) and the sum of the costs of the 
resources he has used:
ui(σ, xi) = Vi(xi) −

The expected utility of agent i from strategy profile σ, Ui(σ),
is, therefore:

σi = ∅ (does not assign his task to any resource), then his
expected utility, Ui(∅, σ−i), equals zero.
