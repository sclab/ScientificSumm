Let { } be the set of agents in the system. The
network of agents is modelled as a graph =( , ), where is the
set of agents and is a set of bidirectional edges denoted as 
nonordered pairs ( , ). The neighbourhood of an agent includes
all the one-hop away agents (i.e. its acquaintance agents) such
that ( ) The set of acquaintances of is denoted by
Each agent maintains (a) an ontology that represents categories of
information, (b) indices of information pieces available to its local
database and to other agents, and (c) a profile model for some of
its acquaintances. Indices and profile models are described in
detail in section 4.
Ontology concepts represent categories that classify the
information pieces available. It is assumed that agents in the
network share the same ontology, but each agent has a set of
information items in its local repository, which are classified
under the concepts of its expertise. The set of concepts is denoted
by It is assumed that the sets of items in agents" local
repositories are non-overlapping.
Finally, it is assumed that there is a set of queries .
Each query is represented by a tuple where is
the unique identity of the query is a non-negative integer
representing the maximum number of information pieces
requested, is the specific category to which these pieces must
belong, is a path in the network of agents through which the
query has been propagated (initially it contains the originator of
the query and each agent appends its id in the before
propagating the query), and is a positive integer that specifies
the maximum number of hops that the query can reach. In case
this limit is exceeded and the corresponding number of
information pieces have not been found, then the query is
considered unfulfilled However, even in this case, a (possibly
high) percentage of the requested pieces of information may have
been found.
The problem that this article deals with is as follows: Given a
network of agents and a set of queries , agents must
retrieve the pieces of information requested by queries, in
concurrent search sessions, and further ‘tune" the network so as to
answer future similar queries in the more effective and efficient
way, increasing the benefit of the system and reducing the
communication messages required. The of the system is
the ratio of information pieces retrieved to the number of
information pieces requested. The of the system is
measured by the number of messages needed for searching and
updating the indexes and profiles maintained.
‘Tuning" the network requires agents to acquire the necessary
information about acquaintances" interests and information
provision abilities (i.e. the routing and profiling tuples detailed in
section 4), so as to route queries and further share information in
the most efficient way. This must be done seamlessly to
searching: I.e. agents in the network must share/acquire the
necessary information while searching, increasing the benefit and
efficiency gradually, as more queries are posed.
