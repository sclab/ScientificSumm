Considering to be a decentralized control problem, information
searching and sharing in large-scale systems of cooperative agents
is a hard problem in the general case: The computation of an
optimal policy, when each agent possesses an approximate partial
view of the state of the environment and when agents"
observations and activities are interdependent (i.e. one agent"s
actions affect the observations and the state of an other) [3], is
hard. This fact, has resulted to efforts that either require agents to
have a global view of the system [15], to heuristics [4], to 
precomputation of agents" information needs and information
provision capabilities for proactive communication [17], to
localized reasoning processes built on incoming information
[12,13,14], and to mathematical frameworks for coordination
whose optimal policies can be approximated [11] for small (sub-)
networks of associated agents.
On the other hand, there is a lot of research on semantic peer to
peer search networks and social networks [1,5,6,8,9,10,16,18,19]
many of which deal with tuning a network of peers for effective
information searching and sharing. They do it mostly by imposing
logical and semantic overlay structures. However, as far as we
know there is no work that demonstrates the effectiveness of a
gradual tuning process in large-scale dynamic networks that
studies the impact of the information gathered by agents as more
and more queries are issued and served in concurrent sessions in
the network.
The main issue in this paper concerns ‘tuning" a network of
agents, each with a specific expertise, for efficient and effective
information searching and sharing, without altering the topology
or imposing an overlay structure via clustering, introduction of
shortcut indices, or re-wiring. ‘ " is the task of sharing and
gathering the knowledge for agents to propagate
requests to the acquaintances, minimizing the searching
effort, increasing the efficiency and the benefit of the system.
Specifically, this paper proposes a method for information
searching and sharing in dynamic and large scale networks, which
combines routing indices with token-based methods for
information sharing in large-scale multi-agent systems.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related
work and motivates the proposed method. Section 3 states the
problem and section 4 presents in detail the individual techniques
and the overall proposed method. Section 5 presents the
experimental setup and results, and section 6 concludes the paper,
sketching future work.
