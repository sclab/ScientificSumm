A number of control theoretic approaches have been 
applied to DRE systems recently. These techniques aid in 
overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches
that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly
and result in a rigidly scheduled system that adapts poorly
to change. A survey of these techniques is presented in [1].
One such approach is feedback control scheduling (FCS) [2,
11]. FCS algorithms dynamically adjust resource allocation
by means of software feedback control loops. FCS 
algorithms are modeled and designed using rigorous 
controltheoretic methodologies. These algorithms provide robust
and analytical performance assurances despite uncertainties
in resource availability and/or demand. Although existing
FCS algorithms have shown promise, these algorithms often
assume that the system has continuous control variable(s)
that can continuously be adjusted. While this assumption
holds for certain classes of systems, there are many classes
of DRE systems, such as avionics and total-ship computing
environments that only support a finite a priori set of 
discrete configurations. The control variables in such systems
are therefore intrinsically discrete.
HyARM handles both continuous control variables, such
as picture resolution, and discrete control variable, such as
discrete set of frame rates. HyARM can therefore be applied
to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of
control variables. The DRE multimedia system as described
in Section 2 is an example DRE system that offers both 
continuous (picture resolution) and discrete set (frame-rate) of
control variables. These variables are modified by HyARM
to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved 
application QoS.
