Mechanism design studies algorithmic constructions 
under the presence of strategic players who hold the inputs
to the algorithm. Algorithmic mechanism design has 
focused mainly on settings were the social planner or designer
wishes to maximize the social welfare (or equivalently, 
minimize social cost), or on auction settings where 
revenuemaximization is the main goal. Alternative optimization
goals, such as those that incorporate fairness criteria (which
have been investigated algorithmically and in social choice
theory), have received very little or no attention.
In this paper, we consider such an alternative goal in the
context of machine scheduling, namely, makespan 
minimization. There are n jobs or tasks that need to be assigned to
m machines, where each job has to be assigned to exactly
one machine. Assigning a job j to a machine i incurs a load
(cost) of pij ≥ 0 on machine i, and the load of a machine is
the sum of the loads incurred due to the jobs assigned to it;
the goal is to schedule the jobs so as to minimize the 
maximum load of a machine, which is termed the makespan of the
schedule. Makespan minimization is a common objective in
scheduling environments, and has been well studied 
algorithmically in both the Computer Science and Operations
Research communities (see, e.g., the survey [12]). Following
the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider each machine
to be a strategic player or agent who privately knows its own
processing time for each job, and may misrepresent these
values in order to decrease its load (which is its incurred
cost). Hence, we approach the problem via mechanism 
design: the social designer, who holds the set of jobs to be
assigned, needs to specify, in addition to a schedule, suitable
payments to the players in order to incentivize them to 
reveal their true processing times. Such a mechanism is called
a truthful mechanism. The makespan-minimization 
objective is quite different from the classic goal of social-welfare
maximization, where one wants to maximize the total 
welfare (or minimize the total cost) of all players. Instead, it
252
corresponds to maximizing the minimum welfare and the 
notion of max-min fairness, and appears to be a much harder
problem from the viewpoint of mechanism design. In 
particular, the celebrated VCG [26, 9, 10] family of mechanisms
does not apply here, and we need to devise new techniques.
The possibility of constructing a truthful mechanism for
makespan minimization is strongly related to assumptions
on the players" processing times, in particular, the 
dimensionality of the domain. Nisan and Ronen considered the
setting of unrelated machines where the pij values may be 
arbitrary. This is a multidimensional domain, since a player"s
private value is its entire vector of processing times (pij)j.
Very few positive results are known for multidimensional
domains in general, and the only positive results known for
multidimensional scheduling are O(m)-approximation 
truthful mechanisms [22, 20]. We emphasize that regardless of
computational considerations, even the existence of a 
truthful mechanism with a significantly better (than m) 
approximation ratio is not known for any such scheduling domain.
On the negative side, [22] showed that no truthful 
deterministic mechanism can achieve approximation ratio better
than 2, and strengthened this lower bound to m for two 
specific classes of deterministic mechanisms. Recently, [20] 
extended this lower bound to randomized mechanisms, and [8]
improved the deterministic lower bound.
In stark contrast with the above state of affairs, much
stronger (and many more) positive results are known for a
special case of the unrelated machines problem, namely, the
setting of related machines. Here, we have pij = pj/si for
every i, j, where pj is public knowledge, and the speed si
is the only private parameter of machine i. This 
assumption makes the domain of players" types single-dimensional.
Truthfulness in such domains is equivalent to a convenient
value-monotonicity condition [21, 3], which appears to make
it significantly easier to design truthful mechanisms in such
domains. Archer and Tardos [3] first considered the related
machines setting and gave a randomized 3-approximation
truthful-in-expectation mechanism. The gap between the
single-dimensional and multidimensional domains is perhaps
best exemplified by the fact that [3] showed that there 
exists a truthful mechanism that always outputs an optimal
schedule. (Recall that in the multidimensional unrelated
machines setting, it is impossible to obtain a truthful 
mechanism with approximation ratio better than 2.) Various
follow-up results [2, 4, 1, 13] have strengthened the notion
of truthfulness and/or improved the approximation ratio.
Such difficulties in moving from the single-dimensional to
the multidimensional setting also arise in other mechanism
design settings (e.g., combinatorial auctions). Thus, in 
addition to the specific importance of scheduling in strategic
environments, ideas from multidimensional scheduling may
also have a bearing in the more general context of truthful
mechanism design for multidimensional domains.
In this paper, we consider the makespan-minimization
problem for a special case of unrelated machines, where
the processing time of a job is either low or high on
each machine. More precisely, in our setting, pij ∈ {Lj, Hj}
for every i, j, where the Lj, Hj values are publicly known
(Lj ≡low, Hj ≡high). We call this model the 
jobdependent two-values case. This model generalizes the 
classic restricted machines setting, where pij ∈ {Lj, ∞} which
has been well-studied algorithmically. A special case of our
model is when Lj = L and Hj = H for all jobs j, which we
denote simply as the two-values scheduling model. Both
of our domains are multidimensional, since the machines are
unrelated: one job may be low on one machine and high on
the other, while another job may follow the opposite 
pattern. Thus, the private information of each machine is a
vector specifying which jobs are low and high on it. Thus,
they retain the core property underlying the hardness of
truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by
studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights
that will be useful for tackling the general problem.
Our Results and Techniques We present various 
positive results for our multidimensional scheduling domains.
Our first result is a general method to convert any 
capproximation algorithm for the job-dependent two values
setting into a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation 
mechanism. This is one of the very few known results that use
an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain
a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem. Our
result implies that there exists a 3-approximation 
truthfulin-expectation mechanism for the Lj-Hj setting. 
Interestingly, the proof of truthfulness is not based on supplying 
explicit prices, and our construction does not necessarily yield
efficiently-computable prices (but the allocation rule is 
efficiently computable). Our second result applies to the 
twovalues setting (Lj = L, Hj = H), for which we improve both
the approximation ratio and strengthen the notion of 
truthfulness. We obtain a deterministic 2-approximation truthful
mechanism (along with prices) for this problem. These are
the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance
guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain. 
Complementing this, we observe that even this seemingly simple
setting does not admit truthful mechanisms that return an
optimal schedule (unlike in the case of related machines).
By exploiting the multidimensionality of the domain, we
prove that no truthful deterministic mechanism can obtain
an approximation ratio better than 1.14 to the makespan
(irrespective of computational considerations).
The main technique, and one of the novelties, 
underlying our constructions and proofs, is that we do not rely on
explicit price specifications in order to prove the 
truthfulness of our mechanisms. Instead we exploit certain 
algorithmic monotonicity conditions that characterize 
truthfulness to first design an implementable algorithm, i.e., an 
algorithm for which prices ensuring truthfulness exist, and then
find these prices (by further delving into the proof of 
implementability). This kind of analysis has been the method
of choice in the design of truthful mechanisms for 
singledimensional domains, where value-monotonicity yields a 
convenient characterization enabling one to concentrate on the
algorithmic side of the problem (see, e.g., [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]).
But for multidimensional domains, almost all positive 
results have relied on explicit price specifications in order to
prove truthfulness (an exception is the work on unknown
single-minded players in combinatorial auctions [17, 7]), a
fact that yet again shows the gap in our understanding of
multidimensional vs. single-dimensional domains.
Our work is the first to leverage monotonicity conditions
for truthful mechanism design in arbitrary domains. The
monotonicity condition we use, which is sometimes called
cycle monotonicity, was first proposed by Rochet [23] (see
also [11]). It is a generalization of value-monotonicity and
completely characterizes truthfulness in every domain. Our
methods and analyses demonstrate the potential benefits
253
of this characterization, and show that cycle monotonicity
can be effectively utilized to devise truthful mechanisms for
multidimensional domains. Consider, for example, our first
result showing that any c-approximation algorithm can be
exported to a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation
mechanism. At the level of generality of an arbitrary 
approximation algorithm, it seems unlikely that one would be
able to come up with prices to prove truthfulness of the
constructed mechanism. But, cycle monotonicity does allow
us to prove such a statement. In fact, some such condition
based only on the underlying algorithm (and not on the
prices) seems necessary to prove such a general statement.
The method for converting approximation algorithms into
truthful mechanisms involves another novel idea. Our 
randomized mechanism is obtained by first constructing a 
truthful mechanism that returns a fractional schedule. Moving
to a fractional domain allows us to plug-in truthfulness
into the approximation algorithm in a rather simple 
fashion, while losing a factor of 2 in the approximation ratio.
We then use a suitable randomized rounding procedure to
convert the fractional assignment into a random integral 
assignment. For this, we use a recent rounding procedure
of Kumar et al. [14] that is tailored for unrelated-machine
scheduling. This preserves truthfulness, but we lose another
additive factor equal to the approximation ratio. Our 
construction uses and extends some observations of Lavi and
Swamy [16], and further demonstrates the benefits of 
fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design.
Related Work Nisan and Ronen [22] first considered the
makespan-minimization problem for unrelated machines. They
gave an m-approximation positive result and proved various
lower bounds. Recently, Mu"alem and Schapira [20] proved
a lower bound of 2 on the approximation ratio achievable
by truthful-in-expectation mechanisms, and Christodoulou,
Koutsoupias, and Vidali [8] proved a (1 +
√
2)-lower bound
for deterministic truthful mechanisms.Archer and Tardos [3]
first considered the related-machines problem and gave a
3-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This
been improved in [2, 4, 1, 13] to: a 2-approximation 
randomized mechanism [2]; an FPTAS for any fixed number of
machines given by Andelman, Azar and Sorani [1], and a
3-approximation deterministic mechanism by Kov´acs [13].
The algorithmic problem (i.e., without requiring 
truthfulness) of makespan-minimization on unrelated machines
is well understood and various 2-approximation algorithms
are known. Lenstra, Shmoys and Tardos [18] gave the first
such algorithm. Shmoys and Tardos [25] later gave a 
2approximation algorithm for the generalized assignment 
problem, a generalization where there is a cost cij for assigning
a job j to a machine i, and the goal is to minimize the cost
subject to a bound on the makespan. Recently, Kumar,
Marathe, Parthasarathy, and Srinivasan [14] gave a 
randomized rounding algorithm that yields the same bounds. We
use their procedure in our randomized mechanism.
The characterization of truthfulness for arbitrary domains
in terms of cycle monotonicity seems to have been first 
observed by Rochet [23] (see also Gui et al. [11]). This 
generalizes the value-monotonicity condition for single-dimensional
domains which was given by Myerson [21] and rediscovered
by [3]. As mentioned earlier, this condition has been 
exploited numerous times to obtain truthful mechanisms for
single-dimensional domains [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]. For convex 
domains (i.e., each players" set of private values is convex), it
is known that cycle monotonicity is implied by a simpler
condition, called weak monotonicity [15, 6, 24]. But even
this simpler condition has not found much application in
truthful mechanism design for multidimensional problems.
Objectives other than social-welfare maximization and 
revenue maximization have received very little attention in 
mechanism design. In the context of combinatorial auctions, the
problems of maximizing the minimum value received by a
player, and computing an envy-minimizing allocation have
been studied briefly. Lavi, Mu"alem, and Nisan [15] showed
that the former objective cannot be implemented truthfully;
Bezakova and Dani [5] gave a 0.5-approximation mechanism
for two players with additive valuations. Lipton et al. [19]
showed that the latter objective cannot be implemented
truthfully. These lower bounds were strengthened in [20].
