A survey of location systems for ubiquitous computing
is provided in [11]. A location tracking system for adhoc
sensor networks using anchor sensors as reference to gain
location information and spread it out to outer node is 
proposed in [17]. Most location tracking systems in adhoc 
sensor networks are for benefiting geographic-aware routing.
They don"t fit well for our purposes. The well-known 
active badge system [19] lets a user carry a badge around.
An infrared sensor in the room can detect the presence of
a badge and determine the location and identification of
the person. This is a useful system for indoor environment,
where GPS doesn"t work. Locationing using 802.11 devices
is probably the cheapest solution for indoor position 
tracking [8]. Because of the popularity and low cost of 802.11
devices, several business solutions based on this technology
have been developed[1].
A system that combines two mature technologies and is
viable in suburban area where a user can see clear sky and
has GSM cellular reception at the same time is currently
available[5]. This system receives GPS signal from a 
satellite and locates itself, draws location on a map, and sends
location information through GSM network to the others
who are interested in the user"s location.
A very simple system to monitor children consists an RF
transmitter and a receiver. The system alarms the holder
of the receiver when the transmitter is about to run out of
range [6].
Personal Locater Beacons (PLB) has been used for avalanche
rescuing for years. A skier carries an RF transmitter that
emits beacons periodically, so that a rescue team can find
his/her location based on the strength of the RF signal. 
Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a 
COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit user"s 
location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever
an accident happens [4]. However, the device either is turned
on all the time resulting in fast battery drain, or must be
turned on after the accident to function.
Another related technology in widespread use today is the
ONSTAR system [3], typically used in several luxury cars.
In this system, a GPS unit provides position information,
and a powerful transmitter relays that information via 
satellite to a customer service center. Designed for emergencies,
the system can be triggered either by the user with the push
of a button, or by a catastrophic accident. Once the system
has been triggered, a human representative attempts to gain
communication with the user via a cell phone built as an 
incar device. If contact cannot be made, emergency services
are dispatched to the location provided by GPS. Like PLBs,
this system has several limitations. First, it is heavy and 
expensive. It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected
network. If connectivity with either the GPS network or a
communication satellite cannot be maintained, the system
fails. Unfortunately, these are common obstacles 
encountered in deep canyons, narrow streets in large cities, parking
garages, and a number of other places.

The Lifetch system uses GPS receiver board combined
with a GSM/GPRS transmitter and an RF transmitter in
one wireless sensor node called Intelligent Communication
Unit (ICU). An ICU first attempts to transmit its location
to a control center through GSM/GPRS network. If that
fails, it connects with other ICUs (adhoc network) to 
forward its location information until the information reaches
an ICU that has GSM/GPRS reception. This ICU then
transmits the location information of the original ICU via
the GSM/GPRS network.
ZebraNet is a system designed to study the moving 
patterns of zebras [13]. It utilizes two protocols: History-based
protocol and flooding protocol. History-based protocol is
used when the zebras are grazing and not moving around
too much. While this might be useful for tracking zebras,
it"s not suitable for tracking hikers because two hikers are
most likely to meet each other only once on a trail. In
the flooding protocol, a node dumps its data to a neighbor
whenever it finds one and doesn"t delete its own copy until
it finds a base station. Without considering routing loops,
packet filtering and grouping, the size of data on a node will
grow exponentially and drain the power and memory of a
sensor node with in a short time. Instead, Cenwits uses a
four-phase hand-shake protocol to ensure that a node 
transmits only as much information as the other node is willing
to receive. While ZebraNet is designed for a big group of
sensors moving together in the same direction with same
speed, Cenwits is designed to be used in the scenario where
sensors move in different directions at different speeds.
Delay tolerant network architecture addresses some 
important problems in challenged (resource-constrained) 
networks [9]. While this work is mainly concerned with 
interoperability of challenged networks, some problems related
to occasionally-connected networks are similar to the ones
we have addressed in CenWits.
Among all these systems, luxury PLB and Lifetch are 
designed for location tracking in wilderness areas. However,
both of these systems require a connected network. Luxury
PLB requires the user to transmit a signal to a satellite,
while Lifetch requires connection to GSM/GPRS network.
Luxury PLB transmits location information, only when an
accident happens. However, if the user is buried in the snow
or falls into a deep canyon, there is almost no chance for the
signal to go through and be relayed to the rescue team. This
is because satellite transmission needs line of sight. 
Furthermore, since there is no known history of user"s location, it is
not possible for the rescue team to infer the current location
of the user. Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a
satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range
of $750. Lifetch attempts to transmit the location 
information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses
AODV as the routing protocol. However, having a cellular
reception in remote areas in wilderness areas, e.g. 
American national parks is unlikely. Furthermore, it is extremely
unlikely that ICUs worn by hikers will be able to form an
adhoc network in a large wilderness area. This is because
the hikers are mobile and it is very unlikely to have several
ICUs placed dense enough to forward packets even on a very
popular hike route.
CenWits is designed to address the limitations of systems
such as luxury PLB and Lifetch. It is designed to 
provide hikers, skiers, and climbers who have their activities
mainly in wilderness areas a much higher chance to convey
their location information to a control center. It is not 
reliant upon constant connectivity with any communication
medium. Rather, it communicates information along from
user to user, finally arriving at a control center. Unlike 
several of the systems discussed so far, it does not require that
a user"s unit is constantly turned on. In fact, it can discover
a victim"s location, even if the victim"s sensor was off at the
time of accident and has remained off since then. CenWits
solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search
and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage 
capability. This means someone within the network will have
access to the last-known-location information of a victim,
and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.
