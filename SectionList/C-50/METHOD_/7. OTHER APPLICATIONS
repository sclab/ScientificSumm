In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can
be used in several other applications, e.g. skiing, climbing,
wild life monitoring, and person tracking. Since CenWits 
relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage
of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby
make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate. Since CenWits
doesn"t rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time,
but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively
cheaper and widely applicable. For example, there are some
dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts. But it is too expensive
for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network
through out the mountain. Using CenWits, we can deploy
some sensors at the cliff boundaries. These boundary 
sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g. every second, and
so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and
fall off the cliff. Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every
hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in
range using PDAs. If a PDA shows that a skier has been
close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long
range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base
to check the witness record of the skier. If there is no 
witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor,
there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.
In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach
a GPS receiver on the animals. To collect data, either a
satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to
wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so)
and then search for the GPS receiver. GPS transmitters are
very expensive, e.g. the one used in geese tracking is $3,000
each [2]. Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal
is harmful to the birds. Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is
quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always
try to get rid of it. Using CenWits, not only can we record
the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior
of wild animals, e.g. lions might follow the migration of
deers. CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive
satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year
and search for the braces. CenWits provides a very simple
and cost-effective solution in this case. Also, access points
190
can be strategically located, e.g. near a water source, to
increase chances of collecting up-to-date data. In fact, the
access points need not be statically located. They can be
placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over
a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.
In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS,
since GPS doesn"t work indoor and near skyscrapers. If a
person A is reported missing, and from the witness records
we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace
an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently.
