A sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and
power. In general, the amount of memory needed and power
consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node
density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of 
access points. In this Section, we provide an estimate of how
long the power of a MICA2 mote will last under certain
assumtions.
First, we assume that each sensor node carries about 100
witness records. On encountering another hiker, a sensor
node transmits 50 witness records and receives 50 new 
witness records. Since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take
0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34 
seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link. The power
consumption of MICA2 due to CPU processing, 
transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 mA, 7.0 mA and
8.5 mA per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an
alkaline battery is 2500mAh.
Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and 
assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake,
power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5
mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per
hour. So, average power consumtion due to transmission
and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 mA per hour.
Given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500
mAh, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of
transmission and reception. An encounter between two 
hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes
about 0.68 seconds as calculated above. Thus, a single 
alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker
encounters.
Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds
and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted
(worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for
(841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days. Since, a Mica2
is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain
operation for about two months. Notice that this 
calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active
24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90
seconds. In a more realistic scenario, power is expected to
last for a much longer time period. Also, this time period
will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving
together.
Finally, the lifetime of a sensor running on two 
batteries can definitely be increased significantly by using energy
scavenging techniques and energy harvesting techniques [16,
14].
