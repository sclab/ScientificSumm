BIDDERS
In this section we define the optimal auction for three bidders,
Υ3, and prove that it indeed matches the known lower bound of
13/6. We follow the definition and proof with a discussion of how
this auction was derived.
DEFINITION 5. Υ3 is scale-invariant and symmetric and given
by the bid-independent function with density function

THEOREM 3. The Υ3 auction has a competitive ratio of 13/6 ≈
2.17, which is optimal. Furthermore, the auction raises exactly
6
13
F(2)
on every input with non-identical bids.
PROOF. Consider the bids 1, x, y, with 1 < x < y. There are
three cases.
CASE 1 (x < y ≤ 3/2): F(2)
= 3. The auction must raise
expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids. The bidder with
valuation x will pay 1 with 9/13, and the bidder with valuation y
will pay 1 with probability 9/13. Therefore Υ3 raises 18/13 on
these bids.
CASE 2 (x ≤ 3/2 < y): F(2)
= 3. The auction must raise 
expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids. The bidder with
177
valuation x will pay 9/13 −
y
3/2
zg(z)dz in expectation. The 
bidder with valuation y will pay 9/13 +
y
3/2
zg(z)dz in expectation.
Therefore Υ3 raises 18/13 on these bids.
CASE 3 (3/2 < x ≤ y): F(2)
= 2x. The auction must raise
expected revenue of at least 12x/13 on these bids. Consider the
revenue raised from all three bidders:
E[Υ3(b)] = p(1, x, y) + p(x, 1, y) + p(y, 1, x)
= 0 + 9/13 −

The final equation comes from substituting in g(x) = 2/13
(x−1)3 and
expanding the integrals. Note that the fraction of F(2)
raised on
every input is identical. If any of the inequalities 1 ≤ x ≤ y
are not strict, the same proof applies giving a lower bound on the
auction"s profit; however, this bound may no longer be tight.
Motivation for Υ3
In this section, we will conjecture that a particular input distribution
is worst-case, and show, as a consequence, that all inputs are 
worstcase in the optimal auction. By applying this consequence, we will
derive an optimal auction for three bidders.
A truthful, randomized auction on n bidders can be represented
by a randomized function f : Rn−1
× n → R that maps masked
bid vectors to prices in R. By normalization, we can assume that
the lowest possible bid is 1. Recall that ρb-i (z) = Pr[f(b-i) = z].
The optimal auction for the finite auction problem can be found
by the following optimization problem in which the variables are
ρb-i (z):
maximize r
subject to
n
i=1
bi
z=1
zρb-i (z)dz ≥ rF(2)
(b)
∞
z=1
ρb-i (z)dz = 1
ρb-i (z) ≥ 0
This set of integral inequalities is difficult to maximize over.
However, by guessing which constraints are tight and which are
slack at the optimum, we will be able to derive a set of differential
equations for which any feasible solution is an optimal auction.
As we discuss in Section 2.4, in [8], the authors define a 
distribution and use it to find a lower bound on the competitive ratio of
the optimal auction. For two bidders, this bid distribution is the
worst-case input distribution. We guess (and later verify) that this
distribution is the worst-case input distribution for three bidders as
well. Since this distribution has full support over the set of all bid
vectors and a worst-case distribution puts positive probability only
on worst-case inputs, we can therefore assume that all but a 
measure zero set of inputs is worst-case for the optimal auction. In the
optimal two-bidder auction, all inputs with non-identical bids are
worst-case, so we will assume the same for three bidders.
The guess that these constraints are tight allows us to transform
the optimization problem into a feasibility problem constrained by
differential equations. If the solution to these equations has value
matching the lower bound obtained from the worst-case 
distribution, then this solution is the optimal auction and that our 
conjectured choice of worst-case distribution is correct.
In Section 6 we show that the optimal auction must sometimes
place probability mass on sale prices above the highest bid. This
motivates considering symmetric scale-invariant auctions for three
bidders with probability density function, ρ1,x(z), of the following
form:
ρ1,x(z) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
1 with discrete probability a(x)
x with discrete probability b(x)
z with probability density g(z) for z > x
In this auction, the sale price for the first bidder is either one
of the latter two bids, or higher than either bid with a probability
density which is independent of the input.
The feasibility problem which arises from the linear optimization
problem by assuming the constraints are tight is as follows:
a(y) + a(x) + xb(x) +
y
x
zg(z)dz = r max(3, 2x) ∀x < y
a(x) + b(x) +
∞
x
g(z)dz = 1
a(x) ≥ 0
b(x) ≥ 0
g(z) ≥ 0
Solving this feasibility problem gives the auction Υ3 proposed
above. The proof of its optimality validates its proposed form.
Finding a simple restriction on the form of n-bidder auctions for
n > 3 under which the optimal auction can be found analytically
as above remains an open problem.
