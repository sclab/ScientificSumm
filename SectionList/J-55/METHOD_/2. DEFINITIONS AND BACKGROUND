We consider single-round, sealed-bid auctions for a set of 
identical units of an item to bidders who each desire one unit. As 
mentioned in the introduction, we adopt the game-theoretic solution
concept of truthful mechanism design. A useful simplification of
the problem of designing truthful auctions is obtained through the
following algorithmic characterization [9]. Related formulations to
this one have appeared in numerous places in recent literature (e.g.,
[1, 14, 5, 10]).
DEFINITION 1. Given a bid vector of n bids, b = (b1, . . . , bn),
let b-i denote the vector of with bi replaced with a ‘?", i.e.,
b-i = (b1, . . . , bi−1, ?, bi+1, . . . , bn).
DEFINITION 2. Let f be a function from bid vectors (with a
‘?") to prices (non-negative real numbers). The deterministic 
bidindependent auction defined by f, BIf , works as follows. For each
bidder i:
1. Set ti = f(b-i).
2. If ti < bi, bidder i wins at price ti.
3. If ti > bi, bidder i loses.
4. Otherwise, (ti = bi) the auction can either accept the bid at
price ti or reject it.
A randomized bid-independent auction is a distribution over 
deterministic bid-independent auctions.
The proof of the following theorem can be found, for example,
in [5].
THEOREM 1. An auction is truthful if and only if it is equivalent
to a bid-independent auction.
Given this equivalence, we will use the the terminology 
bidindependent and truthful interchangeably.
For a randomized bid-independent auction, f(b-i) is a random
variable. We denote the probability density of f(b-i) at z by ρb-i (z).
We denote the profit of a truthful auction A on input b as A(b).
The expected profit of the auction, E[A(b)], is the sum of the 
expected payments made by each bidder, which we denote by pi(b)
for bidder i. Clearly, the expected payment of each bid satisfies
pi(b) =
bi
0
xρb-i (x)dx.
2.1 Competitive Framework
We now review the competitive framework from [5]. In order
to evaluate the performance of auctions with respect to the goal of
profit maximization, we introduce the optimal single price 
omniscient auction F and the related omniscient auction F(2)
.
DEFINITION 3. Give a vector b = (b1, . . . , bn), let b(i) 
represent the i-th largest value in b.
The optimal single price omniscient auction, F, is defined as
follows. Auction F on input b determines the value k such that
kb(k) is maximized. All bidders with bi ≥ b(k) win at price b(k); all
remaining bidders lose. The profit of F on input b is thus F(b) =
max1≤k≤n kb(k).
In the competitive framework of [5] and subsequent papers, the
performance of a truthful auction is gauged in comparison to F(2)
,
the optimal singled priced auction that sells at least two units. The
profit of F(2)
is max2≤k≤n kb(k) There are a number of reasons
to choose this benchmark for comparison, interested readers should
see [5] or [6] for a more detailed discussion.
Let A be a truthful auction. We say that A is β-competitive
against F(2)
(or just β-competitive) if for all bid vectors b, the
expected profit of A on b satisfies
E[A(b)] ≥
F(2)
(b)
β
.
In Section 4 we generalize this framework to other profit 
benchmarks.

2.2 Scale Invariant and Symmetric Auctions
A symmetric auction is one where the auction outcome is 
unchanged when the input bids arrive in a different permutation. 
Goldberg et al. [8] show that a symmetric auction achieves the optimal
competitive ratio. This is natural as the profit benchmark we 
consider is symmetric, and it allows us to consider only symmetric
auctions when looking for the one with the optimal competitive 
ratio.
An auction defined by bid-independent function f is scale 
invariant if, for all i and all z, Pr[f(b-i) ≥ z] = Pr[f(cb-i) ≥ cz].
It is conjectured that the assumption of scale invariance is without
loss of generality. Thus, we are motivated to consider 
symmetric scale-invariant auctions. When specifying a symmetric 
scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the
relative magnitudes of the n − 1 bids in b-i and that one of the
bids, bj = 1. It will be convenient to specify such auctions via the
density function of f(b-i), ρb-i (z). It is enough to specify such a
density function of the form ρ1,z1,...,zn−1 (z) with 1 ≤ zi ≤ zi+1.
2.3 Limited Supply Versus Unlimited Supply
Following [8], throughout the remainder of this paper we will
be making the assumption that n = , i.e., the number of bidders
is equal to the number of units for sale. This is without loss of
generality as (a) any lower bound that applies to the n = case
also extends to the case where n ≥ [8], and (b) there is a 
reduction from the unlimited supply auction problem to the limited
supply auction problem that takes an unlimited supply auction that
is β-competitive with F(2)
and constructs a limited supply auction
parameterized by that is β-competitive with F(2, )
, the optimal
omniscient auction that sells between 2 and units [6].
Henceforth, we will assume that we are in the unlimited supply
case, and we will examine lower bounds for limited supply 
problems by placing a restriction on the number of bidders in the 
auction.
2.4 Lower Bounds and Optimal Auctions
Frequently in this paper, we will refer to the best known lower
bound on the competitive ratio of truthful auctions:
THEOREM 2. [8] The competitive ratio of any auction on n
bidders is at least
1 −
n
i=2
−1
n
i−1
i
i − 1
n − 1
i − 1
.
DEFINITION 4. Let Υn denote the n-bidder auction that achieves
the optimal competitive ratio.
This bound is derived by analyzing the performance of any 
auction on the following distribution B. In each random bid 
vector B, each bid Bi is drawn i.i.d. from the distribution such that
Pr[Bi ≥ s] ≤ 1/s for all s ∈ S.
In the two-bidder case, this lower bound is 2. This is achieved by
Υ2 which is the 1-unit Vickrey auction.1
In the three-bidder case,
this lower bound is 13/6. In the next section, we define the 
auction Υ3 which matches this lower bound. In the four-bidder case,
this lower bound is 96/215. In the limit as the number of bidders
grows, this lower bound approaches a number which is 
approximately 2.42.
It is conjectured that this lower bound is tight for any number of
bidders and the optimal auction, Υn, matches it.

highest bid value.
2.5 Profit Extraction
In this section we review the truthful profit extraction mechanism
ProfitExtractR. This mechanism is a special case of a general
cost-sharing schema due to Moulin and Shenker [11].
The goal of profit extraction is, given bids b, to extract a target
value R of profit from some subset of the bidders.
ProfitExtractR: Given bids b, find the largest k such
that the highest k bidders can equally share the cost
R. Charge each of these bidders R/k. If no subset
of bidders can cover the cost, the mechanism has no
winners.
Important properties of this auction are as follows:
• ProfitExtractR is truthful.
• If R ≤ F(b), ProfitExtractR(b) = R; otherwise it has no
winners and no revenue.
We will use this profit extraction mechanism in Section 5 with
the following intuition. Such a profit extractor makes it possible to
treat this subset of bidders as a single bid with value F(S). Note
that given a single bid, b, a truthful mechanism might offer it price
t and if t ≤ b then the bidder wins and pays t; otherwise the 
bidder pays nothing (and loses). Likewise, a mechanism can offer
the set of bidders S a target revenue R. If R ≤ F(2)
(S), then
ProfitExtractR raises R from S; otherwise, the it raises no 
revenue from S.
