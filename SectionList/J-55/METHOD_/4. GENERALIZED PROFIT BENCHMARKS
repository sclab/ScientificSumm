In this section, we widen our focus beyond auctions that compete
with F(2)
to consider other benchmarks for an auction"s profit. We
will show that, for three bidders, the form of the optimal auction
is essentially independent of the benchmark profit used. This 
results strongly corroborates the worst-case competitive analysis of
auctions by showing that our techniques allow us to derive auctions
which are competitive against a broad variety of reasonable 
benchmarks rather than simply against F(2)
.
Previous work in competitive analysis of auctions has focused on
the question of designing the auction with the best competitive 
ratio against F(2)
, the profit of the optimal omniscient single-priced
mechanism that sells at least two items. However, it is reasonable to
consider other benchmarks. For instance, one might wish to 
compete against V∗
, the profit of the k-Vickrey auction with 
optimal-inhindsight choice of k.2
Alternatively, if an auction is being used as
a subroutine in a larger mechanism, one might wish to choose the
auction which is optimally competitive with a benchmark specific
to that purpose.
Recall that F(2)
(b) = max2≥k≥n kb(k). We can generalize this
definition to Gs, parameterized by s = (s2, . . . , sn) and defined as:
Gs(b) = max
2≤k≤n
skb(k).
When considering Gs we assume without loss of generality that
si < si+1 as otherwise the constraint imposed by si+1 is irrelevant.
Note that F(2)
is the special case of Gs with si = i, and that V∗
=
Gs with si = i − 1.

Recall that the k-Vickrey auction sells a unit to each of the 
highest k bidders at a price equal to the k + 1st highest bid, b(k+1),
achieving a profit of kb(k+1).

Competing with Gs
We will now design a three-bidder auction Υs,t
3 that achieves the
optimal competitive ratio against Gs,t. As before, we will first find
a lower bound on the competitive ratio and then design an auction
to meet that bound.
We can lower bound the competitive ratio of Υs,t
3 using the same
worst-case distribution from [8] that we used against F(2)
. 
Evaluating the performance of any auction competing against Gs,t on
this distribution will yield the following theorem. We denote the
optimal auction for three bidders against Gs,t as Υs,t
3 .
THEOREM 4. The optimal three-bidder auction, Υs,t
3 , 
competing against Gs,t(b) = max(sb(2), tb(3)) has a competitive ratio of
at least s2
+t2
2t
.
The proof can be found in the appendix.
Similarly, we can find the optimal auction against Gs,t using the
same technique we used to solve for the three bidder auction with
the best competitive ratio against F(2)
.

THEOREM 5. Υs,t
3 is s2
+t2
2t
-competitive with Gs,t.
This auction, like Υ3, can be derived by reducing the optimization
problem to a feasibility problem, guessing that the optimal solution
has the same form as Υs,t
3 , and solving. The auction is optimal 
because it matches the lower bound found above. Note that the form
of Υs,t
3 is essentially the same as for Υ3, but that the probability of
each price is scaled depending on the values of s and t.
That our auction for three bidders matches the lower bound 
computed by the input distribution used in [8] is strong evidence that
this input distribution is the worst-case input distribution for any
number of bidders and any generalized profit benchmark. 
Furthermore, we strongly suspect that for any number of bidders, the form
of the optimal auction will be independent of the benchmark used.
