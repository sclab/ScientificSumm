AUCTIONS
In this section, we define a class of auctions that never offer a
sale price which is higher than any bid in the input and prove a
lower bound on the competitive ratio of these auctions. As this
180
lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of Theorem 2 for
n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge
a sales price higher than any bid in the input. Specifically, this result
partially explains the form of the optimal three bidder auction.
DEFINITION 8. We say an auction BIf is conservative if its 
bidindependent function f satisfies f(b-i) ≤ max(b-i).
We can now state our lower bound for conservative auctions.
THEOREM 10. Let A be a conservative auction for n bidders.
Then the competitive ratio of A is at least 3n−2
n
.
COROLLARY 1. The competitive ratio of any conservative 
auction for an arbitrary number of bidders is at least three.
For a two-bidder auction, this restriction does not prevent 
optimality. Υ2, the 1-unit Vickrey auction, is conservative. For larger
numbers of bidders, however, the restriction to conservative 
auctions does affect the competitive ratio. For the three-bidder case,
Υ3 has competitive ratio 2.17, while the best conservative auction
is no better than 2.33-competitive.
The k-Vickrey auction and the Random Sampling Optimal Price
auction [9] are conservative auctions. The Random Sampling Profit
Extraction auction [5] and the CORE auction [7], on the other hand,
use the ProfitExtractR mechanism as a subroutine and thus 
sometimes offer a sale price which is higher than the highest input bid
value.
In [8], the authors define a restricted auction as one on which,
for any input, the sale prices are drawn from the set of input bid
values. The class of conservative auctions can be viewed as a 
generalization of the class of restricted auctions and therefore our result
below gives lower bounds on the performance of a broader class of
auctions.
We will prove Theorem 10 with the aid of the following lemma:
LEMMA 1. Let A be a conservative auction with competitive
ratio 1/r for n bidders. Let h n. Let h0 = 1 and hk = kh 
otherwise. Then, for all k and H ≥ kh, Pr[f(1, 1, . . . , 1, H) ≤ hk] ≥
nr−1
n−1
+ k(3nr−2r−n
n−1
).
PROOF. The lemma is proved by strong induction on k. First
some notation that will be convenient. For any particular k and
H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, . . . , 1, hk, H)
and placing bounds on ρb-i (z). Since we can assume without loss
of generality that the auction is symmetric, we will notate b-1 as
b with any one of the 1-valued bids masked. Similarly we notate
b-hk
(resp. b-H ) as b with the hk-valued bid (resp. H-valued bid)
masked. We will also let p1(b), phk
(b), and pH (b) represent the
expected payment of a 1-valued, hk-valued, and H-valued bidder
in A on b, respectively (note by symmetry the expected payment
for all 1-valued bidders is the same).
Base case (k = 0, hk = 1): A must raise revenue of at least rn
on b = (1, . . . , 1, 1, H):
rn ≤ pH (b) + (n − 1)p1(b)
= 1 + (n − 1)

xρb-1 (x)dx
≤ 1 + (n − 1)

ρb-1 (x)dx
The second inequality follows from the conservatism of the 
underlying auction. The base case follows trivially from the final 
inequality.
Inductive case (k > 0, hk = kh): Let b = (1, . . . , 1, hk, H).
First, we will find an upper bound on pH(b)

Equation (1) follows from the conservatism of A and (2) is from
invoking the strong inductive hypothesis with H = kh and the
observation that the maximum possible revenue will be found by
placing exactly enough probability at each multiple of h to satisfy
the constraints of the inductive hypothesis and placing the 
remaining probability at kh. Next, we will find a lower bound on phk
(b)
by considering the revenue raised by the bids b. Recall that A must
obtain a profit of at least rF(2)
(b) = 2rkh. Given upper-bounds
on the profit from the H-valued, equation bid (3), and the 1-valued
bids, the profit from the hk-valued bid must be at least:
phk
(b) ≥ 2rkh − (n − 2)p1(b) − pH(b)

− O(n).
(4)
In order to lower bound Pr[f(b-hk
) ≤ kh], consider the auction
that minimizes it and is consistent with the lower bounds obtained
by the strong inductive hypothesis on Pr[f(b-hk
) ≤ ih]. To 
minimize the constraints implied by the strong inductive hypothesis, we
place the minimal amount of probability mass required each price
level. This gives ρhk
(b) with nr−1
n−1
probability at 1 and exactly
3nr−2r−n
n−1
at each hi for 1 ≤ i < k. Thus, the profit from offering
prices at most hk−1 is nr−1
n−1
−kh(k−1)3nr−2r−n
n−1
. In order to 
satisfy our lower bound, (4), on phk
(b), it must put at least 3nr−2r−n
n−1
on hk.
Therefore, the probability that the sale price will be no more than
kh on masked bid vector on bid vector b = (1, . . . , 1, kh, H) must
be at least nr−1
n−1
+ k(3nr−2r−n
n−1
).
Given Lemma 1, Theorem 10 is simple to prove.
PROOF. Let A be a conservative auction. Suppose 3nr−2r−n
n−1
=
> 0. Let k = 1/ , H ≥ kh, and h n. By Lemma 1,
Pr[f(1, . . . , 1, kh, H) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1
n−1
+ k > 1. But this is a
contradiction, so 3nr−2r−n
n−1
≤ 0. Thus, r ≤ n
3n−2
. The theorem
follows.
