rector that can fail independently. The goal of the failover
protocol is to reconfigure the BuddyCache in the case of a
node failure, so that the failure of one node does not disrupt
other clients from accessing shared objects. Moreover, the
failure of the redirector should allow unaffected clients to
keep their caches intact.
We have designed a failover protocols for BuddyCache
but have not implemented it yet. The appendix outlines the
protocol.
