Grid computing [1] is an emerging collaborative
computing paradigm to extend institution/organization
specific high performance computing (HPC) capabilities
greatly beyond local resources. Its importance stems from
the fact that ground breaking research in strategic
application areas such as bioscience and medicine, energy
exploration and environmental modeling involve strong
interdisciplinary components and often require intercampus
collaborations and computational capabilities beyond
institutional limitations.
The Texas Internet Grid for Research and Education
(TIGRE) [2,3] is a state funded cyberinfrastructure
development project carried out by five (Rice, A&M, TTU,
UH and UT Austin) major university systems - collectively
called TIGRE Institutions. The purpose of TIGRE is to
create a higher education Grid to sustain and extend
research and educational opportunities across Texas.
TIGRE is a project of the High Performance Computing
across Texas (HiPCAT) [4] consortium. The goal of
HiPCAT is to support advanced computational technologies
to enhance research, development, and educational
activities.
The primary goal of TIGRE is to design and deploy
state-of-the-art Grid middleware that enables integration of
computing systems, storage systems and databases,
visualization laboratories and displays, and even
instruments and sensors across Texas. The secondary goal
is to demonstrate the TIGRE capabilities to enhance
research and educational opportunities in strategic
application areas of interest to the State of Texas. These are
bioscience and medicine, energy exploration and air quality
modeling. Vision of the TIGRE project is to foster
interdisciplinary and intercampus collaborations, identify
novel approaches to extend academic-government-private
partnerships, and become a competitive model for external
funding opportunities. The overall goal of TIGRE is to
support local, campus and regional user interests and offer
avenues to connect with national Grid projects such as
Open Science Grid [5], and TeraGrid [6].
Within the energy exploration strategic application area,
we have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
[7] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and
demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the
TIGRE environment and the GridWay [8] metascheduler.
Section 2 provides an overview of the TIGRE environment
and capabilities. Application description and the need for
Grid-enabling EnKF methodology is provided in Section 3.
The implementation details and merits of our approach are
discussed in Section 4. Conclusions are provided in Section
5. Finally, observations and lessons learned are documented
in Section 6.
