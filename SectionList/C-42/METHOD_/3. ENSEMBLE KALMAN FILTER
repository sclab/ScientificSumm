APPLICATION
The main goal of hydrocarbon reservoir simulations is to
forecast the production behavior of oil and gas field
(denoted as field hereafter) for its development and optimal
management. In reservoir modeling, the field is divided into
several geological models as shown in Figure 1. For
accurate performance forecasting of the field, it is necessary
to reconcile several geological models to the dynamic
response of the field through history matching [16-20].

layers correspond to different geological models and the
nails are oil wells whose historical information will be
used for forecasting the production behavior.

The EnKF is a Monte Carlo method that works with an
ensemble of reservoir models. This method utilizes 
crosscovariances [21] between the field measurements and the
reservoir model parameters (derived from several models)
to estimate prediction uncertainties. The geological model
parameters in the ensemble are sequentially updated with a
goal to minimize the prediction uncertainties. Historical
production response of the field for over 50 years is used in
these simulations. The main advantage of EnKF is that it
can be readily linked to any reservoir simulator, and can
assimilate latest production data without the need to re-run
the simulator from initial conditions. Researchers in Texas
are large subscribers of the Schlumberger ECLIPSE [22]
package for reservoir simulations. In the reservoir
modeling, each geological model checks out an ECLIPSE
license. The simulation runtime of the EnKF methodology
depends on the number of geological models used, number
of ECLIPSE licenses available, production history of the
field, and propagated uncertainties in history matching.
The overall EnKF workflow is shown Figure 2.

Workflow. Each site has L licenses.
At START, the master/control process (EnKF main
program) reads the simulation configuration file for number
(N) of models, and model-specific input files. Then, N
working directories are created to store the output files. At
the end of iteration, the master/control process collects the
output files from N models and post processes 
crosscovariances [21] to estimate the prediction uncertainties.
This information will be used to update models (or input
files) for the next iteration. The simulation continues until
the production histories are exhausted.
Typical EnKF simulation with N=50 and field histories
of 50-60 years, in time steps ranging from three months to a
year, takes about three weeks on a serial computing
environment.
In parallel computing environment, there is no
interprocess communication between the geological models
in the ensemble. However, at the end of each simulation
time-step, model-specific output files are to be collected for
analyzing cross covariances [21] and to prepare next set of
input files. Therefore, master-slave model in 
messagepassing (MPI) environment is a suitable paradigm. In this
approach, the geological models are treated as slaves and
are distributed across the available processors. The master

process collects model-specific output files, analyzes and
prepares next set of input files for the simulation. Since
each geological model checks out an ECLIPSE license,
parallelizability of the simulation depends on the number of
licenses available. When the available number of licenses is
less than the number of models in the ensemble, one or
more of the nodes in the MPI group have to handle more
than one model in a serial fashion and therefore, it takes
longer to complete the simulation.
A Petroleum Engineering Department usually procures
10-15 ECLIPSE licenses while at least ten-fold increase in
the number of licenses would be necessary for industry
standard simulations. The number of licenses can be
increased by involving several Petroleum Engineering
Departments that support ECLIPSE package.
Since MPI does not scale very well for applications that
involve remote compute clusters, and to get around the
firewall issues with license servers across administrative
domains, Grid-enabling the EnKF workflow seems to be
necessary. With this motivation, we have implemented
Grid-enabled EnKF workflow for the TIGRE environment
and demonstrated parallelizability of the application across
TIGRE using GridWay metascheduler. Further details are
provided in the next section.
