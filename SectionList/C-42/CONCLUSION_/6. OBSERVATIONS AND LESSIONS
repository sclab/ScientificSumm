The Grid-enabling efforts for EnKF application have
provided ample opportunities to gather insights on the
visibility and promise of Grid computing environments for
application development and support. The main issues are
industry standard data security and QoS comparable to
cluster computing.
Since the reservoir modeling research involves
proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial
efforts initially in educating the application researchers on
the ability of Grid services in supporting the industry
standard data security through role- and privilege-based
access using X.509 standard.
With respect to QoS, application researchers expect
cluster level QoS with Grid environments. Also, there is a
steep learning curve in Grid computing compared to the
conventional cluster computing. Since Grid computing is
still an emerging technology, and it spans over several
administrative domains, Grid computing is still premature
especially in terms of the level of QoS although, it offers
better data security standards compared to commodity
clusters.
It is our observation that training and outreach programs
that compare and contrast the Grid and cluster computing
environments would be a suitable approach for enhancing
user participation in Grid computing. This approach also
helps users to match their applications and abilities Grids
can offer.
In summary, our efforts through TIGRE in Grid-enabling
the EnKF data assimilation methodology showed
substantial promise in engaging Petroleum Engineering
researchers through intercampus collaborations. Efforts are
under way to involve more schools in this effort. These
efforts may result in increased collaborative research,
educational opportunities, and workforce development
through graduate/faculty research programs across TIGRE
Institutions.
