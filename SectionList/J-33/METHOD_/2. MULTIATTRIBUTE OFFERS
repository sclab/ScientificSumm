2.1 Basic Definitions
The distinguishing feature of a multiattribute auction is that the
goods are defined by vectors of attributes, x = (x1, . . . , xm),
xj ∈ Xj . A configuration is a particular attribute vector, x ∈
X =
Qm
j=1 Xj . The outcome of the auction is a set of bilateral
trades. Trade t takes the form t = (x, q, b, s, π), signifying that
agent b buys q > 0 units of configuration x from seller s, for 
payment π > 0. For convenience, we use the notation xt to denote the
configuration associated with trade t (and similarly for other 
elements of t). For a set of trades T, we denote by Ti that subset of T
involving agent i (i.e., b = i or s = i). Let T denote the set of all
possible trades.
A bid expresses an agent"s willingness to participate in trades.
We specify the semantics of a bid in terms of offer sets. Let OT
i ⊆
Ti denote agent i"s trade offer set. Intuitively, this represents the
trades in which i is willing to participate. However, since the 
outcome of the auction is a set of trades, several of which may involve
agent i, we must in general consider willingness to engage in trade
combinations. Accordingly, we introduce the combination offer set
of agent i, OC
i ⊆ 2Ti .
2.2 Specifying Offer Sets
A fully expressive bid language would allow specification of 
arbitrary combination offer sets. We instead consider a more limited
class which, while restrictive, still captures most forms of 
multiattribute bidding proposed in the literature. Our bids directly specify
part of the agent"s trade offer set, and include further directives 
controlling how this can be extended to the full trade and combination
offer sets.
For example, one way to specify a trade (buy) offer set would
be to describe a set of configurations and quantities, along with the
maximal payment one would exchange for each (x, q) specified.
This description could be by enumeration, or any available means
of defining such a mapping.
An explicit set of trades in the offer set generally entails inclusion
of many more implicit trades. We assume payment monotonicity,
which means that agents always prefer more money. That is, for
π > π > 0,
(x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT
i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π ) ∈ OT
i ,
(x, q, b, i, π ) ∈ OT
i ⇒ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT
i .
We also assume free disposal, which dictates that for all i, q >
q > 0,
(x, q , i, s, π) ∈ OT
i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT
i ,
(x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT
i ⇒ (x, q , b, i, π) ∈ OT
i .
Note that the conditions for agents in the role of buyers and sellers
are analogous. Henceforth, for expository simplicity, we present
all definitions with respect to buyers only, leaving the definition
for sellers as understood. Allowing agents" bids to comprise offers
from both buyer and seller perspectives is also straightforward.
An assertion that offers are divisible entails further implicit 
members in the trade offer set.
DEFINITION 1 (DIVISIBLE OFFER). Agent i"s offer is 
divisible down to q iff
∀q < q < q. (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT
i ⇒ (x, q , i, s, q
q
π) ∈ OT
i .
We employ the shorthand divisible to mean divisible down to 0.
The definition above specifies arbitrary divisibility. It would 
likewise be possible to define divisibility with respect to integers, or to
any given finite granularity. Note that when offers are divisible, it
suffices to specify one offer corresponding to the maximal quantity
one is willing to trade for any given configuration, trading partner,
and per-unit payment (called the price).
At the extreme of indivisibility are all-or-none offers.
DEFINITION 2 (AON OFFER). Agent i"s offer is all-or-none
(AON) iff
(x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT
i ∧ (x, q , i, s, π ) ∈ OT
i ⇒ [q = q ∨ π = π ].
In many cases, the agent will be indifferent with respect to 
different trading partners. In that event, it may omit the partner element
from trades directly specified in its offer set, and simply assert that
its offer is anonymous.
DEFINITION 3 (ANONYMITY). Agent i"s offer is anonymous
iff ∀s, s , b, b . (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT
i ⇔ (x, q, i, s , π) ∈ OT
i ∧
(x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT
i ⇔ (x, q, b , i, π) ∈ OT
i .
Because omitting trading partner qualifications simplifies the 
exposition, we generally assume in the following that all offers are
anonymous unless explicitly specified otherwise. Extending to the
non-anonymous case is conceptually straightforward. We employ
the wild-card symbol ∗ in place of an agent identifier to indicate
that any agent is acceptable.
To specify a trade offer set, a bidder directly specifies a set of
willing trades, along with any regularity conditions (e.g., 
divisibility, anonymity) that implicitly extend the set. The full trade offer
set is then defined by the closure of this direct set with respect to
payment monotonicity, free disposal, and any applicable 
divisibility assumptions.
We next consider the specification of combination offer sets.
Without loss of generality, we restrict each trade set T ∈ OC
i to
include at most one trade for any combination of configuration and
trading partner (multiple such trades are equivalent to one net trade
aggregating the quantities and payments). The key question is to
what extent the agent is willing to aggregate deals across 
configurations or trading partners. One possibility is disallowing any 
aggregation.
111
DEFINITION 4 (NO AGGREGATION). The no-aggregation 
combinations are given by ONA
i = {∅} ∪ {{t} | t ∈ OT
i }. Agent i"s
offer exhibits non-aggregation iff OC
i = ONA
i .
We require in general that OC
i ⊇ ONA
i .
A more flexible policy is to allow aggregation across trading
partners, keeping configuration constant.
DEFINITION 5 (PARTNER AGGREGATION). Suppose a 
particular trade is offered in the same context (set of additional trades,
T) with two different sellers, s and s . That is,
{(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ T ∈ OC
i ∧ {(x, q, i, s , π)} ∪ T ∈ OC
i .
Agent i"s offer allows seller aggregation iff in all such cases,
{(x, q , i, s, π ), (x, q − q , i, s , π − π )} ∪ T ∈ OC
i .
In other words, we may create new trade offer combinations by
splitting the common trade (quantity and payment, not necessarily
proportionately) between the two sellers.
In some cases, it might be reasonable to form combinations by
aggregating different configurations.
DEFINITION 6 (CONFIGURATION AGGREGATION). Suppose
agent i offers, in the same context, the same quantity of two (not
necessarily different) configurations, x and x . That is,
{(x, q, i, ∗, π)} ∪ T ∈ OC
i ∧ {(x , q, i, ∗, π )} ∪ T ∈ OC
i .
Agent i"s offer allows configuration aggregation iff in all such cases
(and analogously when it is a seller),
{(x, q , i, ∗,
q
q
π), (x , q − q , i, ∗,
q − q
q
π )} ∪ T ∈ OC
i .
Note that combination offer sets can accommodate offerings of
configuration bundles. However, classes of bundles formed by 
partner or configuration aggregation are highly regular, covering only a
specific type of bundle formed by splitting a desired quantity across
configurations. This is quite restrictive compared to the general
combinatorial case.
2.3 Willingness to Pay
An agent"s offer trade set implicitly defines the agent"s 
willingness to pay for any given configuration and quantity. We assume
anonymity to avoid conditioning our definitions on trading partner.
DEFINITION 7 (WILLINGNESS TO PAY). Agent i"s willingness
to pay for quantity q of configuration x is given by
ˆuB
i (x, q) = max π s.t. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT
i .
We use the symbol ˆu to recognize that willingness to pay can be
viewed as a proxy for the agent"s utility function, measured in 
monetary units. The superscript B distinguishes the buyer"s 
willingnessto-pay function from, a seller"s willingness to accept, ˆuS
i (x, q), 
defined as the minimum payment seller i will accept for q units of
configuration x. We omit the superscript where the distinction is
inessential or clear from context.
DEFINITION 8 (TRADE QUANTITY BOUNDS). Agent i"s 
minimum trade quantity for configuration x is given by
qi(x) = min q s.t. ∃π. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT
i .
The agent"s maximum trade quantity for x is
¯qi(x) = max q s.t.
∃π. (x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT
i ∧ ¬∃q < q. (x, q , i, ∗, π) ∈ OT
i .
When the agent has no offers involving x, we take qi(x) = ¯qi(x) =
0.
It is useful to define a special case where all configurations are
offered in the same quantity range.
DEFINITION 9 (CONFIGURATION PARITY). Agent i"s offers
exhibit configuration parity iff
qi(x) > 0 ∧ qi(x ) > 0 ⇒ qi(x) = qi(x ) ∧ ¯qi(x) = ¯qi(x ).
Under configuration parity we drop the arguments from trade 
quantity bounds, yielding the constants ¯q and q which apply to all offers.
DEFINITION 10 (LINEAR PRICING). Agent i"s offers exhibit
linear pricing iff for all qi(x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi(x),
ˆui(x, q) =
q
¯qi(x)
ˆui(x, ¯qi(x)).
Note that linear pricing assumes divisibility down to qi(x). Given
linear pricing, we can define the unit willingness to pay, ˆui(x) =
ˆui(x, ¯qi(x))/¯qi(x), and take ˆui(x, q) = qˆui(x) for all qi(x) ≤
q ≤ ¯qi(x).
In general, an agent"s willingness to pay may depend on a context
of other trades the agent is engaging in.
DEFINITION 11 (WILLINGNESS TO PAY IN CONTEXT). Agent
i"s willingness to pay for quantity q of configuration x in the 
context of other trades T is given by
ˆuB
i (x, q; T) = max π s.t. {(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ Ti ∈ OC
i .
LEMMA 1. If OC
i is either non aggregating, or exhibits linear
pricing, then
ˆuB
i (x, q; T) = ˆuB
i (x, q).
