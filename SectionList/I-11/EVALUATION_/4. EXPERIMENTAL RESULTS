We have tested BEE in a series of experiments in which 
human wargamers make decisions that are played out in a battlefield
simulator. The commander for each side (Red and Blue) has at his
disposal a team of pucksters, human operators who set waypoints
for individual units in the simulator. Each puckster is responsible
for four to six units. The simulator moves the units, determines
firing actions, and resolves the outcome of conflicts. It is
important to emphasize that this simulator is simply a surrogate
for a sensor feed from a real-world battlefield
4.1 Fitting Dispositions
To test our ability to fit personalities based on behavior, one
Red puckster responsible for four units is designated the 
emotional puckster. He selects two of his units to be cowardly
(chickens) and two to be irritable (Rambos). He does not 
disclose this assignment during the run. He moves each unit 
according to the commander"s orders until the unit encounters 
circumstances that would trigger the emotion associated with the unit"s
disposition. Then he manipulates chickens as though they are
fearful (avoiding combat and moving away from Blue), and
moves Rambos into combat as quickly as possible. Our software
receives position reports on all units, every twenty seconds.

developed by our colleagues Rafael Alonso, Hua Li, and John
Asmuth at Sarnoff Corporation. Alonso and Li are now at SET

The difference between the two disposition values 
(Irritability - Cowardice) of the fittest ghosts proves a better indicator of
the emotional state of the corresponding entity than either value
by itself. Figure 4 shows the delta disposition for each of the eight
fittest ghosts at each time step, plotted against the time in seconds,
for a unit played as a chicken. The values clearly trend negative.
Figure 5 shows a similar plot for a Rambo. Rambos tend to die
early, and often do not give their ghosts enough time to evolve a
clear picture of their personality, but in
this case the positive Delta Disposition is
evident before the unit"s demise.
To characterize a unit"s personality,
we maintain a 800-second exponentially
weighted moving average of the Delta
Disposition, and declare the unit to be a
chicken or Rambo if this value passes a
negative or positive threshold, respectively. Currently, this 
threshold is set at 0.25. We are exploring additional filters. For example,
a rapid rate of increase enhances the likelihood of calling a
Rambo; units that seek to avoid detection and avoid combat are
more readily called chicken.
Table 1 shows the detection results for emotional units in a
recent series of experiments. We never called a Rambo a chicken.
In the one case where we called a chicken a Rambo, logs show
that in fact the unit was being played aggressively, rushing toward
oncoming Blue forces. The brave die young, so we almost never
detect units played intentionally as Rambos.
Figure 6 shows a comparison on a separate series of 
experiments of our emotion detector compared with humans. Two 
cowards were played in each of eleven games. Human observers in
each game were able to detect a total of 13 of the cowards. BEE
was able to detect cowards (= chickens) much earlier than the
human, while missing only one chicken that the humans detected.
In addition to these results on units intentionally played as
emotional, BEE sometimes detects other units as cowardly or
brave. Analysis of these units shows that these characterizations
were appropriate: units that flee in the face of enemy forces or
weapons fire are detected as chickens, while those that stand their
ground or rush the adversary are denominated as Rambos.
4.2 Integrated Predictions
Each ghost that runs into the future generates a possible path
that its unit might follow. The paths in the resulting set over all
ghosts vary in how likely they are, the risk they pose to their own
or the opposite side, and so forth. In the experiments reported
here, we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance
from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way.
In this sense, it is the most likely future. In these experiments, we
receive position reports only on units that have actually come
within visual range of Blue units, or on average fewer than half of
the live Red units at any time.
We evaluate predictions spatially, comparing an entity"s 
actual location with the location predicted
for it 15 minutes earlier. We compare
BEE with two baselines: a 
gametheoretic predictor based on linguistic
geometry [22], and estimates by military
officers. In both cases, we use a CEP
(circular error probable) measure of
accuracy, the radius of the circle that one
would have to draw around each prediction to capture 50% of the
actual unit locations. The higher the CEP measure, the worse the
accuracy.
Figure 7 compares our accuracy with that of the 
gametheoretic predictor. Each point gives the median CEP measure
over all predictions in a single run. Points above the diagonal 
favor BEE, while points below the line favor the game-theoretic
predictor. In all but two missions, BEE is more accurate. In one
mission, the two systems are comparable, while in one, the

theoretic predictor is more accurate.
In 18 RAID runs, BEE generated 1405 predictions at each of
two time horizons (0 and 15 minutes), while in 18 non-RAID
runs, staff generated 102 predictions. Figure. 8 shows a 
box-andwhisker plot of the CEP measures, in meters, of these predictions.
The box covers the inter-quartile range with a line at the median,
whiskers extend to the most distant data points within 1.5 of the
interquartile range from the edge of the box, squares show outliers
within 3 interquartile ranges, and stars show more distant outliers.
BEE"s median score even at 15 minutes is lower than either Staff
median. The Wilcoxon test shows that the difference between the
H15 scores is significant at the 99.76% level, while that between
the H0 scores is significant at more than 99.999%.
