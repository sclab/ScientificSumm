In many domains, it is important to reason from an entity"s
observed behavior to an estimate of its internal state, and then to
extrapolate that estimate to predict the entity"s future behavior.
BEE performs this task using a faster-than-real-time simulation of
swarming agents, coordinated through digital pheromones. This
simulation integrates knowledge of threat regions, a cognitive
analysis of the agent"s beliefs, desires, and intentions, a model of
the agent"s emotional disposition and state, and the dynamics of
interactions with the environment. By evolving agents in this rich
environment, we can fit their internal state to their observed 
behavior. In realistic wargames, the system successfully detects 
deliberately played emotions and makes reasonable predictions
about the entities" future behaviors.
BEE can only model internal state variables that impact the
agent"s external behavior. It cannot fit variables that the agent
does not manifest externally, since the basis for the evolutionary
cycle is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simulated
agent with that of the real entity. This limitation is serious if our
purpose is to understand the entity"s internal state for its own
sake. If our purpose of fitting agents is to predict their subsequent
behavior, the limitation is much less serious. State variables that
do not impact behavior, while invisible to a behavior-based 
analysis, are irrelevant to a behavioral prediction.
The BEE architecture lends itself to extension in several
promising directions.
The various inputs being integrated by the BEE are only an 
example of the kinds of information that can be handled. The 
basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a
wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as
well, requiring much less additional engineering than other
more traditional ways of reasoning about how different 
knowledge sources come together in impacting an agent"s behavior.
With such a change in inputs, BEE could be applied more
widely than its current domain of adversarial reasoning in 
urban warfare. Potential applications of interest include computer
games, business strategy, and sensor fusion.
Our initial limited repertoire of emotions is a small subset of
those that have been distinguished by psychologists, and that
might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior. We
expect to extend the set of emotions and supporting 
dispositions that BEE can detect.
The mapping between an agent"s psychological (cognitive and
emotional) state and its outward behavior is not one-to-one.
Several different internal states might be consistent with a
given observed behavior under one set of environmental 
conditions, but might yield distinct behaviors under other conditions.
If the environment in the recent past is one that confounds such
distinct internal states, we will be unable to distinguish them.
As long as the environment stays in this state, our predictions
will be accurate, whichever of the internal states we assign to
the agent. If the environment then shifts to one under which the
different internal states lead to different behaviors, using the
previously chosen internal state will yield inaccurate 
predictions. One way to address these concerns is to probe the real
world, perturbing it in ways that would stimulate distinct 
behaviors from entities whose psychological state is otherwise 
indistinguishable. Such probing is an important intelligence 
technique. BEE"s faster-than-real-time simulation may enable us to
identify appropriate probing actions, greatly increasing the 
effectiveness of intelligence efforts.
