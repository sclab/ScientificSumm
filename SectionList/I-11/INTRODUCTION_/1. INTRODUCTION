Reasoning about agents that we observe in the world must
integrate two disparate levels. Our observations are often limited
to the agent"s external behavior, which can frequently be 
summarized numerically as a trajectory in space-time (perhaps 
punctuated by actions from a fairly limited vocabulary). However, this
behavior is driven by the agent"s internal state, which (in the case
of a human) may involve high-level psychological and cognitive
concepts such as intentions and emotions. A central challenge in
many application domains is reasoning from external observations
of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state. Such 
reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agent"s behavior.
This problem has traditionally been addressed under the 
rubric of plan recognition or plan inference. Work to date 
focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed
to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an 
interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit 
communications between agents (as in managing conversational 
protocols). Many realistic problems deviate from these conditions.
Increasing the number of agents leads to a combinatorial 
explosion that can swamp conventional analysis.
Environmental dynamics can frustrate agent intentions.
The agents often are trying to hide their intentions (and even
their presence), rather than intentionally sharing information.
An agent"s emotional state may be at least as important as its
rational state in determining its behavior.
Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be 
characterized as adversarial, and include military combat, competitive
business tactics, and multi-player computer games.
BEE (Behavioral Evolution and Extrapolation) is a novel 
approach to recognizing the rational and emotional state of multiple
interacting agents based solely on their behavior, without recourse
to intentional communications from them. It is inspired by 
techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical 
systems, in which a representation of the system is continually fit to
its recent past behavior. For nonlinear dynamical systems, the 
representation is a closed-form mathematical equation. In BEE, it is a
set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents 
representing the individuals being analyzed. The current version of
BEE characterizes and predicts the behavior of agents 
representing soldiers engaged in urban combat [8].
Section 2 reviews relevant previous work. Section 3 
describes the architecture of BEE. Section 4 reports results from
experiments with the system. Section 5 concludes. Further details
that cannot be included here for the sake of space are available in
an on-line technical report [16].
