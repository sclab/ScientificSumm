In this paper we proposed a robust query expansion 
technique called latent concept expansion. The technique was
shown to be a natural extension of the Markov random field
model for information retrieval and a generalization of 
relevance models. LCE is novel in that it performs single or
multi-term expansion within a framework that allows the
modeling of term dependencies and the use of arbitrary 
features, whereas previous work has been based on the bag of
words assumption and term occurrence features.
We showed that the technique can be used to produce
high quality, well formed, topically relevant multi-term 
expansion concepts. The concepts generated can be used in
an alternative query suggestion module. We also showed
that the model is highly effective. In fact, it achieves 
significant improvements in mean average precision over relevance
models across a selection of TREC data sets. It was also
shown the MRF model itself, without any query expansion,
outperforms relevance models on large web data sets. This
reconfirms previous observations that modeling 
dependencies via the use of proximity features within the MRF has
more of an impact on larger, noisier collections than smaller,
well-behaved ones.
Finally, we reiterated the importance of choosing 
expansion terms that model relevance, rather than the relevant
documents and showed how LCE captures both syntactic
and query-side semantic dependencies. Future work will
look at incorporating document-side dependencies, as well.
