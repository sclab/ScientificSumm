Users of information retrieval systems are required to 
express complex information needs in terms of Boolean 
expressions, a short list of keywords, a sentence, a question, or
possibly a longer narrative. A great deal of information is
lost during the process of translating from the information
need to the actual query. For this reason, there has been
a strong interest in query expansion techniques. Such 
techniques are used to augment the original query to produce a
representation that better reflects the underlying 
information need.
Query expansion techniques have been well studied for
various models in the past and have shown to significantly
improve effectiveness in both the relevance feedback and
pseudo-relevance feedback setting [12, 21, 28, 29].
Recently, a Markov random field (MRF) model for 
information retrieval was proposed that goes beyond the 
simplistic bag of words assumption that underlies BM25 and the
(unigram) language modeling approach to information 
retrieval [20, 22]. The MRF model generalizes the unigram,
bigram, and other various dependence models [14]. Most
past term dependence models have failed to show consistent,
significant improvements over unigram baselines, with few
exceptions [8]. The MRF model, however, has been shown
to be highly effective across a number of tasks, including ad
hoc retrieval [14, 16], named-page finding [16], and Japanese
language web search [6].
Until now, the model has been solely used for ranking 
documents in response to a given query. In this work, we show
how the model can be extended and used for query 
expansion using a technique that we call latent concept expansion
(LCE). There are three primary contributions of our work.
First, LCE provides a mechanism for combining term 
dependence with query expansion. Previous query expansion
techniques are based on bag of words models. Therefore, by
performing query expansion using the MRF model, we are
able to study the dynamics between term dependence and
query expansion.
Next, as we will show, the MRF model allows arbitrary
features to be used within the model. Query expansion 
techniques in the past have implicitly only made use of term
occurrence features. By using more robust feature sets, it
is possible to produce better expansion terms that 
discriminate between relevant and non-relevant documents better.
Finally, our proposed approach seamlessly provides a 
mechanism for generating both single and multi-term concepts.
Most previous techniques, by default, generate terms 
independently. There have been several approaches that make
use of generalized concepts, however such approaches were
somewhat heuristic and done outside of the model [19, 28].
Our approach is both formally motivated and a natural 
extension of the underlying model.
The remainder of this paper is laid out as follows. In
Section 2 we describe related query expansion approaches.
Section 3 provides an overview of the MRF model and 
details our proposed latent concept expansion technique. In
Section 4 we evaluate our proposed model and analyze the
results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and 
summarizes the major results.
