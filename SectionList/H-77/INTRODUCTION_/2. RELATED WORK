2.1 Document Metadata Extraction
Methods have been proposed for performing automatic metadata
extraction from documents; however, the main focus was on
extraction from research papers.
The proposed methods fall into two categories: the rule based
approach and the machine learning based approach.
Giuffrida et al. [9], for instance, developed a rule-based system for
automatically extracting metadata from research papers in
Postscript. They used rules like titles are usually located on the
upper portions of the first pages and they are usually in the largest
font sizes. Liddy et al. [14] and Yilmazel el al. [23] performed
metadata extraction from educational materials using rule-based
natural language processing technologies. Mao et al. [16] also
conducted automatic metadata extraction from research papers
using rules on formatting information.
The rule-based approach can achieve high performance. However,
it also has disadvantages. It is less adaptive and robust when
compared with the machine learning approach.
Han et al. [10], for instance, conducted metadata extraction with
the machine learning approach. They viewed the problem as that
of classifying the lines in a document into the categories of
metadata and proposed using Support Vector Machines as the
classifier. They mainly used linguistic information as features.
They reported high extraction accuracy from research papers in
terms of precision and recall.
2.2 Information Extraction
Metadata extraction can be viewed as an application of
information extraction, in which given a sequence of instances, we
identify a subsequence that represents information in which we
are interested. Hidden Markov Model [6], Maximum Entropy
Model [1, 4], Maximum Entropy Markov Model [17], Support
Vector Machines [3], Conditional Random Field [12], and Voted
Perceptron [2] are widely used information extraction models.
Information extraction has been applied, for instance, to 
part-ofspeech tagging [20], named entity recognition [25] and table
extraction [19].
2.3 Search Using Title Information
Title information is useful for document retrieval.
In the system Citeseer, for instance, Giles et al. managed to
extract titles from research papers and make use of the extracted
titles in metadata search of papers [8].
In web search, the title fields (i.e., file properties) and anchor texts
of web pages (HTML documents) can be viewed as â€˜titles" of the
pages [5]. Many search engines seem to utilize them for web page
retrieval [7, 11, 18, 22]. Zhang et al., found that web pages with
well-defined metadata are more easily retrieved than those without
well-defined metadata [24].
To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on
using extracted titles from general documents (e.g., Office
documents) for search of the documents.
