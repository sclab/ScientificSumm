Metadata of documents is useful for many kinds of document
processing such as search, browsing, and filtering. Ideally,
metadata is defined by the authors of documents and is then used
by various systems. However, people seldom define document
metadata by themselves, even when they have convenient
metadata definition tools [26]. Thus, how to automatically extract
metadata from the bodies of documents turns out to be an
important research issue.
Methods for performing the task have been proposed. However,
the focus was mainly on extraction from research papers. For
instance, Han et al. [10] proposed a machine learning based
method to conduct extraction from research papers. They
formalized the problem as that of classification and employed
Support Vector Machines as the classifier. They mainly used
linguistic features in the model.1
In this paper, we consider metadata extraction from general
documents. By general documents, we mean documents that may
belong to any one of a number of specific genres. General
documents are more widely available in digital libraries, intranets
and the internet, and thus investigation on extraction from them is
sorely needed. Research papers usually have well-formed styles
and noticeable characteristics. In contrast, the styles of general
documents can vary greatly. It has not been clarified whether a
machine learning based approach can work well for this task.
There are many types of metadata: title, author, date of creation,
etc. As a case study, we consider title extraction in this paper.
General documents can be in many different file formats:
Microsoft Office, PDF (PS), etc. As a case study, we consider
extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint.
We take a machine learning approach. We annotate titles in
sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and
take them as training data to train several types of models, and
perform title extraction using any one type of the trained models.
In the models, we mainly utilize formatting information such as
font size as features. We employ the following models: Maximum
Entropy Model, Perceptron with Uneven Margins, Maximum
Entropy Markov Model, and Voted Perceptron.
In this paper, we also investigate the following three problems,
which did not seem to have been examined previously.
(1) Comparison between models: among the models above, which
model performs best for title extraction;
(2) Generality of model: whether it is possible to train a model on
one domain and apply it to another domain, and whether it is
possible to train a model in one language and apply it to another
language;
(3) Usefulness of extracted titles: whether extracted titles can
improve document processing such as search.
Experimental results indicate that our approach works well for
title extraction from general documents. Our method can
significantly outperform the baselines: one that always uses the
first lines as titles and the other that always uses the lines in the
largest font sizes as titles. Precision and recall for title extraction
from Word are 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and
recall for title extraction from PowerPoint are 0.875 and 0.895
respectively. It turns out that the use of format features is the key
to successful title extraction.
(1) We have observed that Perceptron based models perform
better in terms of extraction accuracies. (2) We have empirically
verified that the models trained with our approach are generic in
the sense that they can be trained on one domain and applied to
another, and they can be trained in one language and applied to
another. (3) We have found that using the extracted titles we can
significantly improve precision of document retrieval (by 10%).
We conclude that we can indeed conduct reliable title extraction
from general documents and use the extracted results to improve
real applications.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we
introduce related work, and in section 3, we explain the
motivation and problem setting of our work. In section 4, we
describe our method of title extraction, and in section 5, we
describe our method of document retrieval using extracted titles.
Section 6 gives our experimental results. We make concluding
remarks in section 7.
