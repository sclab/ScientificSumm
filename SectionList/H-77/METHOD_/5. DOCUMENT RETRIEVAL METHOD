We describe our method of document retrieval using extracted
titles.
Typically, in information retrieval a document is split into a
number of fields including body, title, and anchor text. A ranking
function in search can use different weights for different fields of
149
the document. Also, titles are typically assigned high weights,
indicating that they are important for document retrieval. As
explained previously, our experiment has shown that a significant
number of documents actually have incorrect titles in the file
properties, and thus in addition of using them we use the extracted
titles as one more field of the document. By doing this, we attempt
to improve the overall precision.
In this paper, we employ a modification of BM25 that allows field
weighting [21]. As fields, we make use of body, title, extracted
title and anchor. First, for each term in the query we count the
term frequency in each field of the document; each field
frequency is then weighted according to the corresponding weight
parameter:
∑=
f
tfft tfwwtf
Similarly, we compute the document length as a weighted sum of
lengths of each field. Average document length in the corpus
becomes the average of all weighted document lengths.
∑=
f
ff dlwwdl
In our experiments we used 75.0,8.11 == bk . Weight for content
was 1.0, title was 10.0, anchor was 10.0, and extracted title was
5.0.
