SETTING
We consider the issue of automatically extracting titles from
general documents.
By general documents, we mean documents that belong to one of
any number of specific genres. The documents can be
presentations, books, book chapters, technical papers, brochures,
reports, memos, specifications, letters, announcements, or resumes.
General documents are more widely available in digital libraries,
intranets, and internet, and thus investigation on title extraction
from them is sorely needed.
Figure 1 shows an estimate on distributions of file formats on
intranet and internet [15]. Office and PDF are the main file
formats on the intranet. Even on the internet, the documents in the
formats are still not negligible, given its extremely large size. In
this paper, without loss of generality, we take Office documents as
an example.
Figure 1. Distributions of file formats in internet and intranet.
For Office documents, users can define titles as file properties
using a feature provided by Office. We found in an experiment,
however, that users seldom use the feature and thus titles in file
properties are usually very inaccurate. That is to say, titles in file
properties are usually inconsistent with the ‘true" titles in the file
bodies that are created by the authors and are visible to readers.
We collected 6,000 Word and 6,000 PowerPoint documents from
an intranet and the internet and examined how many titles in the
file properties are correct. We found that surprisingly the accuracy
was only 0.265 (cf., Section 6.3 for details). A number of reasons
can be considered. For example, if one creates a new file by
copying an old file, then the file property of the new file will also
be copied from the old file.
In another experiment, we found that Google uses the titles in file
properties of Office documents in search and browsing, but the
titles are not very accurate. We created 50 queries to search Word
and PowerPoint documents and examined the top 15 results of
each query returned by Google. We found that nearly all the titles
presented in the search results were from the file properties of the
documents. However, only 0.272 of them were correct.
Actually, ‘true" titles usually exist at the beginnings of the bodies
of documents. If we can accurately extract the titles from the
bodies of documents, then we can exploit reliable title information
in document processing. This is exactly the problem we address in
this paper.
More specifically, given a Word document, we are to extract the
title from the top region of the first page. Given a PowerPoint
document, we are to extract the title from the first slide. A title
sometimes consists of a main title and one or two subtitles. We
only consider extraction of the main title.
As baselines for title extraction, we use that of always using the
first lines as titles and that of always using the lines with largest
font sizes as titles.

Figure 3. Title extraction from PowerPoint document.
Next, we define a ‘specification" for human judgments in title data
annotation. The annotated data will be used in training and testing
of the title extraction methods.
Summary of the specification: The title of a document should be
identified on the basis of common sense, if there is no difficulty in
the identification. However, there are many cases in which the
identification is not easy. There are some rules defined in the
specification that guide identification for such cases. The rules
include a title is usually in consecutive lines in the same format,
a document can have no title, titles in images are not
considered, a title should not contain words like ‘draft",
147
‘whitepaper", etc, if it is difficult to determine which is the title,
select the one in the largest font size, and if it is still difficult to
determine which is the title, select the first candidate. (The
specification covers all the cases we have encountered in data
annotation.)
Figures 2 and 3 show examples of Office documents from which
we conduct title extraction. In Figure 2, ‘Differences in Win32
API Implementations among Windows Operating Systems" is the
title of the Word document. ‘Microsoft Windows" on the top of
this page is a picture and thus is ignored. In Figure 3, ‘Building
Competitive Advantages through an Agile Infrastructure" is the
title of the PowerPoint document.
We have developed a tool for annotation of titles by human
annotators. Figure 4 shows a snapshot of the tool.
