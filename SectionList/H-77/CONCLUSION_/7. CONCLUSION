In this paper, we have investigated the problem of automatically
extracting titles from general documents. We have tried using a
machine learning approach to address the problem.
Previous work showed that the machine learning approach can
work well for metadata extraction from research papers. In this
paper, we showed that the approach can work for extraction from
general documents as well. Our experimental results indicated that
the machine learning approach can work significantly better than
the baselines in title extraction from Office documents. Previous
work on metadata extraction mainly used linguistic features in
documents, while we mainly used formatting information. It
appeared that using formatting information is a key for
successfully conducting title extraction from general documents.
We tried different machine learning models including Perceptron,
Maximum Entropy, Maximum Entropy Markov Model, and Voted
Perceptron. We found that the performance of the Perceptorn
models was the best. We applied models constructed in one
domain to another domain and applied models trained in one
language to another language. We found that the accuracies did
not drop substantially across different domains and across
different languages, indicating that the models were generic. We
also attempted to use the extracted titles in document retrieval. We
observed a significant improvement in document ranking
performance for search when using extracted title information. All
the above investigations were not conducted in previous work, and
through our investigations we verified the generality and the
significance of the title extraction approach.
