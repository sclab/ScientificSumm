We proposed a novel method for multi-document topic
segmentation and alignment based on weighted mutual 
information, which can also handle single-document cases. We
used dynamic programming to optimize our algorithm. Our
approach outperforms all the previous methods on 
singledocument cases. Moreover, we also showed that doing 
segmentation among multiple documents can improve the 
performance tremendously. Our results also illustrated that 
using weighted mutual information can utilize the information
of multiple documents to reach a better performance.
We only tested our method on limited data sets. More
data sets especially complicated ones should be tested. More
previous methods should be compared with. Moreover, 
natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be
used to find the optimal boundaries. Supervised learning
also can be considered.
