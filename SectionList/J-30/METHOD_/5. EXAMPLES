Our results apply to a variety of economic, computational
and networked settings. In this section, we demonstrate the
applicability of our results to public-good models, signaling
games and routing applications.
5.1 Application 1: Public Goods
The public-good model deals with a social planner (e.g.,
government) that needs to decide whether to supply a 
public good, such as building a bridge. Let Y es and No denote
the respective alternatives of building and not building the
bridge. v = v1, . . . , vn is the vector of the players" 
typesthe values they gain from using the bridge. The decision that
maximizes the social welfare is to build the bridge if and only
if
P
i vi is greater than its cost, denoted by C. If the bridge
is built, the social welfare is
P
i vi − C, and zero otherwise;
thus, g(v, Y es) =
P
i vi − C, and g(v, No) = 0. The utility
of player i under payment pi is ui = vi − pi if the bridge is
built, and 0 otherwise. It is well-known that under no 
restriction on the action space, it is possible to induce truthful
revelation by VCG mechanisms, therefore full efficiency can
be achieved. Obviously, when the action set is limited to
k actions, we cannot achieve full efficiency due to the 
informational constraints. Yet, since g(v, Y es) and g(v, No)
are multilinear and single crossing, we can directly apply
Theorem 1. Hence, the information-theoretically optimal 
kaction mechanism is implementable in dominant strategies.
Corollary 2. The k-action informationally optimal 
social welfare in the n-player public-good game is
implementable in dominant strategies.
Moreover, as Theorem 3 suggests, in the k-action 2-player
public-good game, we can fully characterize the optimal
mechanisms. In the proof of Theorem 3, we saw that when
for both players g(θi, θi, A) = g(θi, θi, B), the mechanism is
non-degenerate with respect to both players.6
This 
condition clearly holds here (1+ 0− C = 0+ 1− C), therefore the
optimal mechanisms will use all k actions.
Corollary 3. The optimal expected welfare in a 2-player
k-action public-good game is achieved with one of the 
following mechanisms:7
1. Allocation: Build the bridge iff b1 + b2 ≥ k.
Strategies: Threshold strategies based on the vectors
−→x ,−→y where for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1,
xi = C − E[v2|v2 ∈ [yk−i, yk−i+1]]
yi = C − E[v1|v1 ∈ [xk−i, xk−i+1]]
2. Allocation: Build the bridge iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1.
Strategies: Threshold strategies based on the vectors
−→x ,−→y where for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1:
xi = C − E[v2|v2 ∈ [yk−i−1, yk−i]]
yi = C − E[v1|v1 ∈ [xk−i−1, xk−i]]
Recall that we define the optimal mechanisms by their 
allocation scheme and by the optimal strategies for the 
players. It is well known, that the allocation scheme in 
monotone mechanisms uniquely defines the payments that ensure
incentive-compatibility. In public-good games, these 
payments satisfy the rule that a player pays his lowest value for
which the bridge is built, when the action of the other player
is fixed. Therefore, the payments for the players 1 and 2 
reporting the actions b1 and b2 are as follows: in mechanism
1 from Proposition 3, p1 = xb2 and p2 = yb1 ; in mechanism
2 from Proposition 3, p1 = xb2−1 and p2 = yb1−1.
We now show a more specific example that assumes 
uniform distributions. The example shows how the optimal
mechanism is determined by the cost C: for low costs, 
mechanism of type 1 is optimal, and for high costs the optimal
mechanism is of type 2. An additional interesting feature of
the optimal mechanisms in the example is that they are 
symmetric with respect to the players. This come as opposed to
the optimal mechanisms in the auction model [5] that are
asymmetric (even when the players" values are drawn from
identical distributions).

More precisely, the condition for non-degeneracy when
B 1 A and B 2 A is that sign(g(θi, θi, A)−g(θi, θi, B)) =
sign(g(θi, θi, A) − g(θi, θi, B)) (when sign(0) is considered
both negative and positive).

Figure 2: Optimal mechanisms in a 2-player, 2-alternative, 2-action public-goods game, when the types are uniformly
distributed in [0, 1]. The mechanism on the left is optimal when C ≤ 1 and the other is optimal when C ≥ 1.
Example 1. Suppose that the types of both players are
uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Figure 2 illustrates the 
optimal mechanisms for k = 2, and shows how both the 
allocation scheme and the payments depend on the construction
cost C. Then, the welfare-maximizing mechanisms are:
• If the cost of building is at least 1:
Allocation: Build iff b1 + b2 ≥ k
Strategies: The thresholds of both players are (for i =
{1, . . . , k − 1}), xi = 2(k−i)·C
2k−1
− 2k−4i+1
2k−1
• If the cost of building is smaller than 1:
Allocation: Build iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1
Strategies: The thresholds of both players are (for i =
{1, . . . , k − 1}), xi = 2iC
2k−1
5.2 Application 2: Signaling
We now study a signaling model in labor markets. In
this model, the type of each worker, θi ∈ [θ, θ], describes
the worker"s productivity level. The firm wants to make her
hiring decisions according to a decision function f(
−→
θ ). For
example, the firm may want to hire the most productive
worker (like the auction model), or hire a group of 
workers only if their sum of productivities is greater than some
threshold (similar to the public-good model). However, the
worker"s productivity is invisible to the firm; the firm only
observes the worker"s education level e that should convey
signals about her productivity level. Note that the 
assumption here is that acquiring education, at any level, does not
affect the productivity of the worker, but only signals about
the worker"s skills.
A main component in this model, is the fact that as the
worker is more productive, it is easier for him to acquire
high-level education. In addition, the cost of acquiring 
education increases with the education level. More formally,
a continuous function C(e, θ) describes the cost to a worker
from acquiring each education level as a function of his 
productivity. The standard assumptions about the cost 
function are: ∂C
∂e
> 0, ∂C
∂θ
< 0, ∂C
∂e∂θ
< 0, where the latter 
requirement is exactly equivalent to the single-crossing 
property (when C is differentiable in both variables). The utility
of a worker is determined according to the education level he
chooses and the wage w(e) attached to this education level,
that is, ui(e, θi) = −C(θi, e) + w(e).
An action for a worker in this game is the education level
he chooses to acquire. In standard models, this action space
is continuous, and then a fully separating equilibrium 
exists (under the single-crossing conditions on the cost 
function). That is, there exists an equilibrium in which every
type is mapped into a different education level; thus, the
firm can induce the exact productivity levels of the workers
by this signaling mechanism. However, it is hard to imagine
a world with a continuum of education levels. It is usually
the case that there are only several discrete education levels
(e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD).
With k education levels, the firm may not be able to 
exactly follow the decision function f. For achieving the best
result in k actions, the firm may want the workers to play 
according to specific threshold strategies. It turns out that the
standard condition, the single-crossing condition on the cost
function, suffices for ensuring that these threshold strategies
will be dominant for the players. We can now apply 
Theorem 2, and show that if the decision function f of the firm
is multilinear (i.e., the decisions are made to maximize a
set of multilinear functions), then the firm can design the
education system such that the expected loss will be O( 1
k2 ),
with a dominant-strategy equilibrium. Note that while in
the classic example of the job market it is not reasonable for
each firm to select the education level, in other reasonable
applications the social planners may be able to determine
the thresholds, e.g., by fixing the levels of qualifying exams
or other means for the players to demonstrate their skills.
Corollary 4. Consider a multilinear decision function
f, and a single-crossing cost function for the players. With k
education levels, the firm can implement in dominant 
strategies a decision function that incurs a loss of O( 1
k2 ) compared
with the decision function f.
5.3 Application 3: Routing
In our last example, we show the applicability of our 
results to routing in lossy networks. In such systems, a sender
needs to decide through which network to transmit his 
message. It is natural to assume that the agents (i.e., links) may
not be able to report their accurate probabilities of success,
but only, e.g., whether these are low, intermediate, or
high. In this example, we focus on parallel-path networks.
Let N1, N2 denote two networks, where each network is
composed of multiple parallel paths with variable lengths
from a given source to a given sink (an example for such a
network appears in Figure 3). The edges in these networks
are controlled by different selfish agents, and each edge 
appears only in one of the networks. Suppose that the sender,
who wishes to send a message from the source to the sink,
knows the topology of each network, but the probability of
success on each link, pi, is the link"s private information.
The problem of the sender is to decide whether to send a
message through the network N1 or through an alternate
network N2. Obviously, the sender wishes to send the 
message through N1 only if the total probability of success in N1
is greater than the success probability in N2. Let fN
(−→p ) 
denote the probability of success in network N with a 
successprobability vector −→p . The social choice function in this 
example is thus: c(−→p ) ∈ argmax{N1,N2}{fN1
(−→p ), fN2
(−→p )}.

Figure 3: An example for a parallel-path network,
where each link has a probability pi for transmission 
success. We show that the overall probability of success in
such networks is multilinear in pi, and thus the optimal
k-action social-choice function is dominant-strategy 
implementable.
In this example, we assume that every agent has a 
singlecrossing valuation function over the alternatives. That is,
each player wishes that the message will be sent through
his network, and his benefit is positively correlated with his
secret data (e.g., the valuation of player i may be exactly
pi). We would like to emphasize that the social planner
in this example (the sender) does not aim to maximize the
social welfare. That is, the social value is not the sum of the
players" types nor any weighted sum of the types (affine
maximizer).
The success probability of sending a message through a
parallel-path network is multilinear, since it can be expressed
by the following multilinear formula (where P denotes the
set of all paths between the source and the sink):
1 −
Y
P ∈P
(1 −
Y
j∈P
pj) (3)
For example, in the network presented in figure 3, the
probability of success is given by
f(−→p ) = 1 − (1 − p1p2) · (1 − p3) · (1 − p4p5)
Thus, if all the candidate networks are parallel-path 
networks, the social-value function is multilinear, and we can
apply Theorem 1 and get the following corollary. Note that
for every link i, the partial derivative in pi of the success
probability written in Equation 3 is positive. In all the other
networks, that do not contain link i, the partial derivative
is clearly zero. Therefore, the social-value function is single
crossing and our general results can be applied.
Corollary 5. For any social-choice function that 
maximizes the success probability over parallel-path networks,
the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function
is implementable (for any k).
