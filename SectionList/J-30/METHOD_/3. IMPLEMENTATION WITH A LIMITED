NUMBER OF ACTIONS
In this section, we study the general model of 
actionbounded mechanism design. Our first result is a sufficient
and necessary condition for the implementability of the 
optimal solution achievable with k actions: this condition says
that the optimal social-choice rule is achieved when all the

players use non-decreasing strategies. The basic idea is that
with non-decreasing strategies (i.e., threshold strategies), we
can apply the single-crossing property to show that when a
player raises his reported action, the expected value for his
high-priority alternatives increases faster; therefore, 
monotonicity must hold. The result holds for any number of 
players and alternatives, and for any profile of distribution 
functions on the players" types, as long as they are statistically
independent. (It is easy to illustrate that this result does
not hold if the players" types are dependent.)
Lemma 1. Consider a single-crossing social-value 
function g. The informationally optimal k-action social-choice
function c∗
(with respect to g) is implementable if and only if
c∗
achieves its optimum when the players use non-decreasing
strategies.
Next, we show that for a wide family of social-value 
functions - multilinear functions - the price of implementation
is zero. That is, the information-theoretically optimal rule
is dominant-strategy implementable. This family of 
functions captures many common settings from the literature.
In particular, it generalizes the auction setting studied by
Blumrosen et al. [4, 6].
Definition 10. A multilinear function is a polynomial
in which the degree of every variable in each monomial is at
most 1.5
We say that a social-choice rule g is multilinear,
if g(·, A) is multilinear for every alternative A ∈ A.
The basic idea behind the proof of the following theorem is
as follows: for every player, we show that the expected social
welfare when he chooses any action (fixing the strategies of
the other players) is a linear function of his type. This is a
result of the multilinearity of the social-value function and
of the linearity of expectation. The maximum over a set of
linear functions is a piecewise-linear function, hence the 
optimal social value is achieved when the player uses threshold
strategies (the thresholds are the switching points). Since
the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies, we can
apply Lemma 1 to show the monotonicity of this 
socialchoice rule. Note that in this argument we characterize the
players" strategies that maximize the social value, and not
the players" utilities.
Theorem 1. If the social-value function is multilinear
and single crossing, the informationally optimal k-action
social-choice function is implementable.
Proof. We will show that for any k-action mechanism,
the optimal expected social value is achieved when all 
players use threshold strategies. This will be shown by proving
that for any player i and for any action bi of player i, the
expected welfare when she chooses the action bi is a 
linear function in player i"s type θi. Then, it will follow from
Lemma 1 that the social choice function is implementable.
For every action bi of player i, let qA denote the 
probability that alternative A is allocated, i.e.,
qA = Pr−→

t(s(

θ )) = A|si(θi) = bi

For example, f(x, y, z) = xyz + 5xy + 7.

Due to the linearity of expectation, the expected social
value when player i with type θi reports bi is:
X
A∈A
qA Eθ−i ( g(θi, θ−i, A) | t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A ) (1)

where fA
−i(θ−i) equals
Q
j=i fj (θj )
qA
for types profiles θ−i such
that t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A, and 0 otherwise.
Since g is multilinear, every function g(θi, θ−i, A) is a 
linear function in θi, where the coefficients depend on the 
values of θ−i. Denote this function by g(θi, θ−i, A) = λθ−i θi +
βθ−i . Thus, we can write Equation 2 as:
X
A∈A

λθ−i fA
−i(θ−i)d(θ−i) +
Z
θ−i
βθ−i fA
−i(θ−i)d(θ−i)
!
In this expression, each integral is a constant 
independent of θi when the strategies of the other player are fixed.
Therefore, each summand, thus the whole function, is a 
linear function in θi. For achieving the optimal expected social
value, the player must choose the action that maximizes the
expected social value. A maximum of k linear functions is a
piecewise-linear function with at most k−1 breaking points.
These breaking points are the thresholds to be used by the
player. For all types between subsequent thresholds, the
optimum is clearly achieved by a single action; Since linear
functions are single-crossing, every action will be maximal
in at most one interval.
The same argument applies to all the players, and 
therefore the optimal social value is obtained with threshold
strategies.
Observe that the proof of Theorem 1 actually works for
a more general setting. For proving that the 
informationtheoretically optimal result is achieved with threshold 
strategies, it is sufficient to show that the social-choice function
exhibits a single-crossing condition on expectation: given
any allocation scheme, and fixing the behavior of the other
players, the expected social value in any two actions (as a
function of θi) is single crossing. Theorem 1 shows that this
requirement holds for multilinear functions, but we were not
able to give an exact characterization of this general class of
functions.
The implementability of the information-theoretically 
optimal solution makes the characterization of the optimal
incentive-compatible mechanisms significantly easier: we
can apply the standard mechanism-design technique and
first calculate the optimal allocation scheme and then find
the right payments.
Observe that if the valuation functions of the players are
linear and single crossing, then the social-welfare function
(i.e., the sum of the players" valuations) is multilinear and
single-crossing. This holds since the single-crossing 
conditions on the valuations are defined with a similar order on
the alternatives as in the social-value function. Therefore,
an immediate conclusion from Theorem 1 is that the 
optimal social welfare, which is achievable with k actions, is
implementable when the valuations are linear.
Corollary 1. If the valuation functions vi(·, A) are 
single crossing and linear in θi for every player i and for every
alternative, then the informationally optimal k-action social
welfare function is implementable.
3.1 Asymptotic Analysis
In this section we show that the social value loss of 
multilinear social-value rules diminishes quadratically with the
number of possible actions, k. This is the same asymptotic
ratio presented in the study of specific models in the same
spirit [19, 5, 18, 9]. The main challenge here, compared
to earlier results, is in dealing with the general 
mechanismdesign framework, that allows a large family of social-value
functions for any number of players and alternatives. As 
opposed to the specific models, the social-value function may
be asymmetric with respect to the players" types; for 
instance, the social-value loss may a-priori occur in any 
entry (i.e., profile of actions).
The basic intuition for the proof is that even for this 
general framework, we can construct mechanisms where the
probability of having an allocation that is incompatible with
the original social-choice function is O( 1
k
). (This fact holds
for all single-crossing social-choice functions, not only for
multilinear functions.) Then, we can use the multilinearity
to show that the social-value loss will always be O( 1
k
) in
the mechanisms we construct. Taken together, the expected
loss becomes O( 1
k2 ). Our proof is constructive - we present
an explicit construction for a mechanism that exhibits the
desired loss in dominant strategies. The additive expected
social-value depends on the length of the support of the type
space. Hence, we assume that the type space is normalized
to [0, 1], that is, for every player i, θi = 0 and θi = 1.
Theorem 2. Assume that the type spaces are normalized
to [0, 1]. For any number of players and alternatives, and
for any set of distribution functions of the players" types, if
the social-value function g is single crossing and 
multilinear, then the informationally optimal k-action social-choice
function (with respect to g) incurs an expected social-value
loss of O( 1
k2 ).
Moreover, as discussed in [4], this bound is asymptotically
tight. That is, there exists a set of distribution functions
for the players (the uniform distribution in particular) and
there are social-value functions (e.g., auctions) for which any
mechanism incurs a social-value loss of at least Ω( 1
k2 ). In
that sense, auctions are the hardest problems with respect to
the incurred loss. Yet, note that this claim does not imply
that the loss of any social-choice function will be 
proportional to 1
k2 . For example, in the social choice function that
chooses the same alternative for any type profile, no loss will
be incurred (even with 0 actions).
