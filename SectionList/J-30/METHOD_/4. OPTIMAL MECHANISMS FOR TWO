PLAYERS AND TWO ALTERNATIVES
In this section, we present a full characterization of the
optimal mechanisms in action-bounded environments with
two players and two alternatives, where the social-choice
functions are multilinear and single crossing.
Note that in this section, as in most parts of this paper,
we characterize monotone mechanisms by their allocation
scheme and by a profile of strategies for the players. Doing
this, we completely describe which alternative is chosen for
every profile of types of the players. It is well known that
in monotone mechanisms for one dimensional environments,
the allocation scheme uniquely defines the payments in the
dominant-strategy implementation. We find this 
description, which does not explicitly mention the payments, easier
for the presentation.
A key notion in our characterization of the optimal 
actionbounded mechanism, is the notion of non-degenerate 
mechanisms. In a degenerate mechanism, there are two actions
for one of the players that are identical in their allocation.
Intuitively, a degenrate mechanism does not utilize all the
action space it is allowed to use, and therefore it cannot
be optimal. Using this propery, we then define diagonal
mechanisms that turns out to exactly characterize the set of
optimal mechanisms.
Definition 11. A mechanism is degenerate with respect
to player i if there exist two actions bi, bi for player i such
that for all profiles b−i of actions of the other players, the
allocation scheme is identical whether player i reports bi or
bi (i.e., ∀b−i, t(bi, b−i) = t(bi, b−i)).
For example, a 2-player mechanism is degenerate with 
respect to the rows player, if there are two rows with 
identical allocation in the matrix representation of the game.
Definition 12. A 2-player 2-alternative mechanism with
k-possible actions is called diagonal if it is monotone, and
non-degenerate with respect to at least one of the players.
The term diagonal originates from the matrix 
representation of these mechanisms, in which one of the diagonals
determines the boundary between the choice of the two 
alternatives (see Figure 1). Simple combinatorial 
considerations show that diagonal mechanisms may come in very few
forms. Interestingly, one of these forms is degenerate with
respect to one of the players; that is, it can be described as
a mechanism with k − 1 actions for this player.
Proposition 2. Any diagonal 2-player mechanism has
one of the following forms:
1. If both players favor the same alternative (w.l.o.g.,
B i A for i = 1, 2) then either
(a). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1
(b). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 + b2 ≥ k.
2. If the two players have conflicting preferences (e.g.,
A 1 B and B 2 A) then either
(a). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 ≥ b2
(b). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 > b2.
In both cases, the optimal mechanism can also take the
form of one of the possibilities described, except one of the
players is not allowed to choose the fixed allocation action.
To complete the description of the optimal allocation
scheme, we now move to determine the optimal strategies
in diagonal mechanisms. We define the notion of 
mutuallymaximizer thresholds, and show that threshold strategies
based on such thresholds are optimal. The reason why
mutually-maximizer strategies maximize the expected social
value in monotone mechanisms is intuitive: Consider some
action i (row in the matrix representation) for player 1. In
a monotone mechanism, the allocation in such a row will be
of the form [A, A, ..., B, B] (assuming that B 2 A). That
is, the alternative A will be chosen for low actions of player
2, and the alternative B will be chosen for higher actions of
player 2. By determining a threshold for player 2, the social
planner actually determines the minimal type of player 2
from which the alternative B will be chosen. For 
optimizing the expected social value, this type for player 2 should
clearly be the type for which the expected social value from
A equals the expected social value from B (given that player
1 plays i); for greater values of player 2, the single-crossing
condition ensures that B will be preferred.
Definition 13. Consider a monotone 2-player 
mechanism g that is non-degenerate with respect to the two 
players, where the players use threshold strategies based on the
threshold vectors x, y. We say that the threshold xi of one
player (w.l.o.g. player 1) is a maximizer if
Eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, A) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) =
Eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, B) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] )
where j is the action of player 2 for which the mechanism
swaps the chosen alternative exactly when player 1 plays i,
i.e., t(i, j) = t(i − 1, j) (we denote, w.l.o.g., t(i, j) = A,
t(i − 1, j) = B).
The threshold vectors x, y are called mutually maximizers
if all their thresholds are maximizers (except the first and
the last).
It turns out that in 2-player, 2-alternative environments,
where the social-choice rule is multilinear and single 
crossing, the optimal expected social value is achieved in 
diagonal mechanisms with mutually-maximizer strategies. In the
proof, we start with a k × k allocation matrix, and show
that the mechanism cannot be degenerate with respect to
one of the players (we show how to choose this player). If
the player, w.l.o.g., the columns player, is degenerate, then
there are two columns with an identical allocation. These
two columns can be unified to a single action, and the 
mechanism can therefore be described as a k × k − 1 matrix. We
then show that we can insert a new missing column, and
an appropriately chosen threshold, and strictly increase the
expected social value in the mechanism. Therefore, the 
original mechanism was not the optimal k-action mechanism.
Theorem 3. In environments with two alternatives and
two players, if the social-value function is multilinear and
single crossing, then the optimal k-action mechanism is 
diagonal, and the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies
that are mutually maximizers.
A corollary from the proof of Theorem 1 is that the optimal
2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of
the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the
players has only k − 1 different actions). However, the proof
identifies the following sufficient condition under which the

optimal mechanism will be non-degenerate with respect to
both players: if the players" preferences are correlated (e.g.,
A 1 B and A 2 B), then the optimal alternative must be
the same under the profiles (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2). Similarly,
if the players" preferences are conflicting (e.g., A 1 B and
B 2 A), then the optimal alternative must be the same
under the profiles (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2). Examples in which
this condition holds are the public good model presented in
section 5 and auctions [5].
We do not know how to give an exact characterization of
the optimal mechanisms in multi-player and multi-alternati
ve environments. The hardness stems from the fact that the
necessary conditions we specified before for the optimality
of the mechanisms (i.e., non-degenrate and monotone 
allocations) are not restrictive enough for the general model. In
other words, for n > 2 players, the number of monotone and
non-degenerate mechanisms becomes exponential in n.
Proposition 3. The number of monotone non- 
degenerate k-action mechanisms in an n-player game is exponential
in n, even if |A| = 2.
