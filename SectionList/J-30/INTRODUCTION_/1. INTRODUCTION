Mechanism design is a sub-field of game theory that 
studies how to design rules of games resulting in desirable 
outcomes, when the players are rational. In a standard 
setting, players hold some private information - their types
- and choose actions from their action spaces to 
maximize their utilities. The social planner wishes to implement
a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of
the world (i.e., a profile of the players" types) to a single
alternative. For example, a government that wishes to 
undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only
if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.
Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts 
attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a player"s
action space is identical to his type space. This focus is
owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some
mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the
same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an 
equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].
Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation
mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the
players have a limited expressive power. Consider, for 
example, the well-studied screening model, where an 
insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different
drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private
information. In this model, drivers may have a continuum of
possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only
a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or
illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.
There are various reasons for such strict restrictions on
the action spaces. In some situations, firms are not willing,
or cannot, run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for
some product or service. The buyers in such environemnts
face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they
may have an infinite number of possible values for the item.
In many similar settings, players might be also reluctant to
reveal their accurate types, but willing to disclose partial 
information about them. For example, agents will typically be
unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them
in the short run, since it might harm them in future 
transactions. Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep
their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact
type while computing it may be expensive [12]. Limitations
on the action space can also be caused by technical 
constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication
lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions
(e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]).

Consider for example a public-good model: a social 
planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge. The two
players in the game have some privately known benefits
θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge. The social planner
aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits 
exceeds the construction cost of the bridge. The social planner
cannot access the private data of the players, and can only
learn about it from the players" actions. When direct 
revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known
VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to 
report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact
private information of the players and build the bridge only
when it should be built. Assume now that the players 
cannot send their entire secret data, but can only choose an
action out of two possible actions (e.g., 0 or 1). Now,
the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always
build the bridge according to her objective function, due to
the limited expressivness of the players" messages. In this
work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence
of such restrictions.
Restrictions on the action space, for specific models, were
studied in several earlier papers. The work of Blumrosen,
Nisan and Segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to this paper.
They studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed
to send messages with severely bounded size. They 
characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and
showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with
very strict limitations on the action space. Other work 
studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending
auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for
measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers
on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14]. Our work
generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a 
general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a
multitude of models. We show that some main properties
proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general
frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy 
equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the
loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a 
similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold
(for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and
that players must always use all their action space).
A standard mechanism design setting is composed of
agents with private information (their types), and a 
social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice 
function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents"
types into a chosen alternative. A classic result in this 
setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the
agents" preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see
definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable
in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the
players" types. However, in environments with restricted 
action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement
every social-choice function due to inherent informational
constraints. That is, for some realizations of the players"
types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible
with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively
measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can 
approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a 
standard assumption that the social choice function is derived
from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value
for every alternative A and realization of the players" types.
The social-choice function c will therefore choose an 
alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type
vector
−→
θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c(
−→
θ ) = argmaxA{g(
−→
θ , A)}.
Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the
social welfare function - the social welfare function is a 
special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the
players" valuations for the chosen alternative. Following are
several simple examples of social-value functions:
• Public goods. A government wishes to build a bridge
only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from
it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value
functions in a 2-player game will therefore be:
g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and
g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0.
• Routing in networks. Consider a network that is 
composed of two links in parallel. Each link has a secret
probability pi of transferring a message successfully.
A sender wishes to send his message through the 
network only if the probability of success is greater than,
say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate
network. That is,
g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and
g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9.
• Single-item auctions. Consider a 2-player auction,
where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the
player who values it the most. The social choice 
function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for
the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) =
θ2.
1.1 Our Contribution
In this paper, we present a general framework for the
study of mechanism design in environments with a limited
number of actions. We assume a Bayesian model where
players have one-dimensional private types, independently
distributed on some real interval.
The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed
to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the 
optimal expected social-value? Note that this question is 
actually composed of two separate questions. The first question
is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal
result achievable when the players can only reveal 
information using these k actions (recall that their type space
may be continuous). The other question involves 
gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable
with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a
dominant-strategy equilibrium. These questions raise the
question about the price of implementation: can the 
optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in
a dominant-strategy equilibrium? And if not, to what 
extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the
optimal result? What we call the price of implementation
was also explored in other contexts in game theory where
computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always
true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio
(for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in
equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still
unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)
Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient
conditions for implementing the optimal 
informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies. We show
that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that
63
is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most
one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy 
implementation incurs no additional cost.
Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing 
socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and 
players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically
optimal is implementable in dominant strategies.
Multilinear social-value functions capture many 
important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the
routing example given above, and any social welfare 
function in which the players" valuations are linear in their types
(such as public-goods and auctions).
The implementability of the information-theoretically 
optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in
Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal 
socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments
that ensure incentive compatibility. To show this result, we
prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for
social-choice functions whose price of implementation is
zero. We show that for any social-choice function, incentive
compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent
to the property that the optimal expected social value is
achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold 
strategies).1
In other words, this lemma implies that one can
always implement, with dominant strategies, the best 
socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.
Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal
action-bounded mechanisms. We identify some necessary
conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and
using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal
mechanisms in environments with two players and two 
alternatives. The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal
- that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will
be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main 
diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games
used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions). We 
complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with
the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are
mutually maximizers. Since the payments in a 
dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone
allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the
payments in the mechanism. We give an intuitive proof for
the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept
of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4]. 
Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some
non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal
mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.
Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value
function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal
2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal
dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.
Achieving a full characterization of the optimal 
actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative
environments seems to be harder. To support this claim,
we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the
necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the
number of players.

The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very 
common in the literature. One remarkable result by Athey [1]
shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response
for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure
Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.
Our next result compares the expected social-value in
k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value
when the action space is unrestricted. For any number of
players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent
distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are
nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1
k2 ). This
result is achieved in dominant strategies.
Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the
optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss
of O( 1
k2 ).
This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific 
environments in [19, 9, 5]. Note that there are social-choice
functions that can be implemented with k actions with no
loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative
A). However, we know that in some settings (e.g., 
auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1
k2 , thus
a better general upper bound is impossible.
Finally, we present our results in the context of several
natural applications. First, we give an explicit solution for
a public-good game with k-actions. We show that the 
optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to
action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal 
allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost
C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which
potential employees send signals about their skills to 
potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.
This is a natural application in our context since education
levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD). Lastly,
we present our results in the context of routing in networks,
where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether
they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to 
require them to report their accurate loss rates. The latter
example illustrates how our results apply to settings where
the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization
(nor variants of it like affine maximizers).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model
and notations are described in Section 2. We then describe
our general results regarding implementation in multi-player
and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including
the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss. In 
Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 
2player environments with two alternative. In Section 5, we
conclude with applying our general results to several 
wellstudied models. Due to lack of space, some of the proofs
are missing and can be found in the full version that can be
found on the authors" web pages.
