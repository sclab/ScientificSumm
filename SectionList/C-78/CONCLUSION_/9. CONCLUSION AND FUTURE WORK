The paper addresses problems of building large distributed
systems interacting with the physical environment and 
being composed from a huge number of smart components.
We cannot assume that the network architecture in such a
system is homogeneous. Rather multiple edge- networks
are fused to a hierarchical, heterogeneous wide area 
network. They connect the tiny sensors and actuators 
perceiving the environment and providing sentience to the 
application. Additionally, mobility and dynamic deployment of
components require the dynamic interaction without fixed,
a priori known addressing and routing schemes. The work
presented in the paper is a contribution towards the 
seamless interaction in such an environment which should not be
restricted by technical obstacles. Rather it should be 
possible to control the flow of information by explicitly specifying
functional and temporal dissemination constraints.
The paper presented the general model of a sentient 
object to describe composition, encapsulation and interaction
in such an environment and developed the Generic Event 
Architecture GEAR which integrates the interaction through
the environment and the network. While appropriate 
abstractions and interaction models can hide the functional
heterogeneity of the networks, it is impossible to hide the
quality differences. Therefore, one of the main concerns is
to define temporal properties in such an open 
infrastructure. The notion of an event channel has been introduced
which allows to specify quality aspects explicitly. They can
be verified at subscription and define a boundary for event
dissemination. The COSMIC middleware is a first attempt
to put these concepts into operation. COSMIC allows the
interoperability of tiny components over multiple network
boundaries and supports the definition of different real-time
event channel classes.
There are many open questions that emerged from our
work. One direction of future research will be the inclusion
of real-world communication channels established between
sensors and actuators in the temporal analysis and the 
ordering of such events in a cause-effect chain. Additionally,
the provision of timing failure detection for the adaptation
of interactions will be in the focus of our research. To reduce
network traffic and only disseminate those events to the 
subscribers which they are really interested in and which have
a chance to arrive timely, the encapsulation and scoping
schemes have to be transformed into respective multi-level
filtering rules. The event attributes which describe aspects
of the context and temporal constraints for the 
dissemination will be exploited for this purpose. Finally, it is intended
to integrate the results in the COSMIC middleware to 
enable experimental assessment.
