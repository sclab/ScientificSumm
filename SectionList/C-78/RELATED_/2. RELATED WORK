Our work considers a wired physical world in which a
very large number of autonomous components cooperate.
It is inspired by many research efforts in very different 
areas. Event-based systems in general have been introduced to
meet the requirements of applications in which entities 
spontaneously generate information and disseminate it [1, 25,
22]. Intended for large systems and requiring quite complex
infrastructures, these event systems do not consider 
stringent quality aspects like timeliness and dependability issues.
Secondly, they are not created to support inter-operability
between tiny smart devices with substantial resource 
constraints.
In [10] a real-time event system for CORBA has been
introduced. The events are routed via a central event server
which provides scheduling functions to support the real-time
requirements. Such a central component is not available
in an infrastructure envisaged in our system architecture
and the developed middleware TAO (The Ace Orb) is quite
complex and unsuitable to be directly integrated in smart
devices.
There are efforts to implement CORBA for control 
networks, tailored to connect sensor and actuator components [15,
19]. They are targeted for the CAN-Bus [9], a popular 
network developed for the automotive industry. However, in
these approaches the support for timeliness or 
dependability issues does not exist or is only very limited.
A new scheme to integrate smart devices in a CORBA 
environment is proposed in [17] and has lead to the proposal of
a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) [26].
Smart transducers are organized in clusters that are 
connected to a CORBA system by a gateway.
The clusters form isolated subnetworks. A special master
node enforces the temporal properties in the cluster subnet.
A CORBA gateway allows to access sensor data and write
actuator data by means of an interface file system (IFS).
The basic structure is similar to the WAN-of-CANs 
structure which has been introduced in the CORTEX project [4].
Islands of tight control may be realized by a control network
and cooperate via wired or wireless networks covering a large
number of these subnetworks. However, in contrast to the
event channel model introduced in this paper, all 
communication inside a cluster relies on a single technical solution of
a synchronous communication channel. Secondly, although
the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously 
defined, no model to specify temporal properties for 
clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided.
