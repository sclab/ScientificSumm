In the following we examine the established IT process
management frameworks IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
and enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM). The aim is
find out where event correlation can be found in the process
structure and how detailed the frameworks currently are.
After that we present our solution for a workflow modeling
for the service-oriented event correlation.
4.1 IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
The British Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and
the IT Service Management Forum (itSMF) [9] provide a
collection of best practices for IT processes in the area of
IT service management which is called ITIL. The service
management is described by 11 modules which are grouped
into Service Support Set (provider internal processes) and
Service Delivery Set (processes at the customer-provider 
interface). Each module describes processes, functions, roles,
and responsibilities as well as necessary databases and 
interfaces. In general, ITIL describes contents, processes, and
aims at a high abstraction level and contains no information
about management architectures and tools.
The fault management is divided into Incident 
Management process and Problem Management process.
Incident Management: The Incident Management 
contains the service desk as interface to customers (e.g.,
receives reports about service problems). In case of
severe errors structured queries are transferred to the
Problem Management.
Problem Management: The Problem Management"s
tasks are to solve problems, take care of keeping 
priorities, minimize the reoccurrence of problems, and to
provide management information. After receiving 
requests from the Incident Management, the problem
has to be identified and information about necessary
countermeasures is transferred to the Change 
Management.
The ITIL processes describe only what has to be done, but
contain no information how this can be actually performed.
As a consequence, event correlation is not part of the 
modeling. The ITIL incidents could be regarded as input for the
service-oriented event correlation, while the output could be
used as a query to the ITIL Problem Management.
4.2 Enhanced Telecom Operations Map
(eTOM)
The TeleManagement Forum (TMF) [18] is an 
international non-profit organization from service providers and
suppliers in the area of telecommunications services. Similar
to ITIL a process-oriented framework has been developed at
first, but the framework was designed for a narrower focus,
i.e., the market of information and communications service
providers. A horizontal grouping into processes for 
customer care, service development & operations, network & 
systems management, and partner/supplier is performed. The
vertical grouping (fulfillment, assurance, billing) reflects the
service life cycle.
In the area of fault management three processes have been
defined along the horizontal process grouping.
Problem Handling: The purpose of this process is to 
receive trouble reports from customers and to solve them
by using the Service Problem Management. The aim
is also to keep the customer informed about the 
current status of the trouble report processing as well as
about the general network status (e.g., planned 
maintenance). It is also a task of this process to inform the
186
QoS/SLA management about the impact of current
errors on the SLAs.
Service Problem Management: In this process reports
about customer-affecting service failures are received
and transformed. Their root causes are identified and
a problem solution or a temporary workaround is 
established. The task of the Diagnose Problem 
subprocess is to find the root cause of the problem by
performing appropriate tests. Nothing is said how this
can be done (e.g., no event correlation is mentioned).
Resource Trouble Management: A subprocess of the
Resource Trouble Management is responsible for 
resource failure event analysis, alarm correlation & 
filtering, and failure event detection & reporting. 
Another subprocess is used to execute different tests to
find a resource failure. There is also another 
subprocess which keeps track about the status of the trouble
report processing. This subprocess is similar to the
functionality of a trouble ticket system.
The process description in eTOM is not very detailed. It
is useful to have a check list which aspects for these processes
have to be taken into account, but there is no detailed 
modeling of the relationships and no methodology for applying
the framework. Event correlation is only mentioned in the
resource management, but it is not used in the service level.
4.3 Workflow Modeling for the 
Service-Oriented Event Correlation
Fig. 2 shows a general service scenario which we will use
as basis for the workflow modeling for the service-oriented
event correlation. We assume that the dependencies are
already known (e.g., by using the approaches mentioned
in Section 2). The provider offers different services which
depend on other services called subservices (service 
dependency). Another kind of dependency exists between 
services/subservices and resources. These dependencies are
called resource dependencies. These two kinds of 
dependencies are in most cases not used for the event correlation
performed today. This resource-oriented event correlation
deals only with relationships on the resource level (e.g., 
network topology).

Figure 2: Different kinds of dependencies for the
service-oriented event correlation
The dependencies depicted in Figure 2 reflect a situation
with no redundancy in the service provisioning. The 
relationships can be seen as AND relationships. In case of 
redundancy, if e.g., a provider has 3 independent web servers,
another modeling (see Figure 3) should be used (OR 
relationship). In such a case different relationships are possible.
The service could be seen as working properly if one of the
servers is working or a certain percentage of them is working.

redundancy (b)
As both ITIL and eTOM contain no description how event
correlation and especially service-oriented event correlation
should actually be performed, we propose the following 
design for such a workflow (see Fig. 4). The additional 
components which are not part of a device-oriented event 
correlation are depicted with a gray background. The workflow is
divided into the phases fault detection, fault diagnosis, and
fault recovery.
In the fault detection phase resource events and service
events can be generated from different sources. The 
resource events are issued during the use of a resource, e.g.,
via SNMP traps. The service events are originated from 
customer trouble reports, which are reported via the Customer
Service Management (see below) access point. In addition
to these two passive ways to get the events, a provider
can also perform active tests. These tests can either deal
with the resources (resource active probing) or can assume
the role of a virtual customer and test a service or one of its
subservices by performing interactions at the service access
points (service active probing).
The fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event 
correlation steps. The first one is performed by the resource
event correlator which can be regarded as the event 
correlator in today"s commercial systems. Therefore, it deals only
with resource events. The service event correlator does a
correlation of the service events, while the aggregate event
correlator finally performs a correlation of both resource and
service events. If the correlation result in one of the 
correlation steps shall be improved, it is possible to go back to
the fault detection phase and start the active probing to get
additional events. These events can be helpful to confirm a
correlation result or to reduce the list of possible root causes.
After the event correlation an ordered list of possible root
causes is checked by the resource management. When the
root cause is found, the failure repair starts. This last step
is performed in the fault recovery phase.
The next subsections present different elements of the
event correlation process.

and provider. Its functionality is to provide information
to the customer about his subscribed services, e.g., reports
about the fulfillment of agreed SLAs. It can also be used to
subscribe services or to allow the customer to manage his
services in a restricted way. Reports about problems with a
service can be sent to the customer via CSM. The CSM is
also contained in the MNM Service Model (see Section 5).
To reduce the effort for the provider"s first level support,
an Intelligent Assistant can be added to the CSM. The 
Intelligent Assistant structures the customer"s information about
a service problem. The information which is needed for a
preclassification of the problem is gathered from a list of
questions to the customer. The list is not static as the 
current question depends on the answers to prior questions or
from the result of specific tests. A decision tree is used
to structure the questions and tests. The tests allow the
customer to gain a controlled access to the provider"s 
management. At the LRZ a customer of the E-Mail Service can,
e.g., use the Intelligent Assistant to perform ping requests
to the mail server. But also more complex requests could be
possible, e.g., requests of a combination of SNMP variables.
4.5 Active Probing
Active probing is useful for the provider to check his 
offered services. The aim is to identify and react to problems
before a customer notices them. The probing can be done
from a customer point of view or by testing the resources
which are part of the services. It can also be useful to 
perform tests of subservices (own subservices or subservices 
offered by suppliers).
Different schedules are possible to perform the active 
probing. The provider could select to test important services
and resources in regular time intervals. Other tests could
be initiated by a user who traverses the decision tree of the
Intelligent Assistant including active tests. Another 
possibility for the use of active probing is a request from the event
correlator, if the current correlation result needs to be 
improved. The results of active probing are reported via service
or resource events to the event correlator (or if the test was
demanded by the Intelligent Assistant the result is reported
to it, too). While the events that are received from 
management tools and customers denote negative events (something
does not work), the events from active probing should also
contain positive events for a better discrimination.
4.6 Event Correlator
The event correlation should not be performed by a single
event correlator, but by using different steps. The reason
for this are the different characteristics of the dependencies
(see Fig. 1).
On the resource level there are only relationships between
resources (network topology, systems configuration). An 
example for this could be a switch linking separate LANs. If
the switch is down, events are reported that other network
components which are located behind the switch are also not
reachable. When correlating these events it can be figured
out that the switch is the likely error cause. At this stage,
the integration of service events does not seem to be helpful.
The result of this step is a list of resources which could be
the problem"s root cause. The resource event correlator is
used to perform this step.
In the service-oriented scenario there are also service and
resource dependencies. As next step in the event 
correlation process the service events should be correlated with
each other using the service dependencies, because the 
service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource
level. The result of this step, which is performed by the 
service event correlator, is a list of services/subservices which
could contain a failure in a resource. If, e.g., there are 
service events from customers that two services do not work
and both services depend on a common subservice, it seems
more likely that the resource failure can be found inside the
subservice. The output of this correlation is a list of 
services/subservices which could be affected by a failure in an
associated resource.
In the last step the aggregate event correlator matches
the lists from resource event correlator and service event
correlator to find the problem"s possible root cause. This is
done by using the resource dependencies.
The event correlation techniques presented in Section 2
could be used to perform the correlation inside the three
event correlators. If the dependencies can be found precisely,
an RBR or codebook approach seems to be appropriate. A
case database (CBR) could be used if there are cases which
could not be covered by RBR or the codebook approach.
These cases could then be used to improve the modeling in
a way that RBR or the codebook approach can deal with
them in future correlations.
