In huge networks a single fault can cause a burst of failure
events. To handle the flood of events and to find the root
cause of a fault, event correlation approaches like rule-based
reasoning, case-based reasoning or the codebook approach
have been developed. The main idea of correlation is to
condense and structure events to retrieve meaningful 
information. Until now, these approaches address primarily the
correlation of events as reported from management tools or
devices. Therefore, we call them device-oriented.
In this paper we define a service as a set of functions
which are offered by a provider to a customer at a customer
provider interface. The definition of a service is therefore
more general than the definition of a Web Service, but a
Web Service is included in this service definition. As
a consequence, the results are applicable for Web Services
as well as for other kinds of services. A service level 
agreement (SLA) is defined as a contract between customer and
provider about guaranteed service performance.
As in today"s IT environments the offering of such services
with an agreed service quality becomes more and more 
important, this change also affects the event correlation. It
has become a necessity for providers to offer such 
guarantees for a differentiation from other providers. To avoid SLA
violations it is especially important for service providers to
identify the root cause of a fault in a very short time or even
act proactively. The latter refers to the case of recognizing
the influence of a device breakdown on the offered services.
As in this scenario the knowledge about services and their
SLAs is used we call it service-oriented. It can be addressed
from two directions.
Top-down perspective: Several customers report a 
problem in a certain time interval. Are these trouble 
reports correlated? How to identify a resource as being
the problem"s root cause?

Bottom-up perspective: A device (e.g., router, server)
breaks down. Which services, and especially which
customers, are affected by this fault?
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2 we describe how event correlation is performed today and
present a selection of the state-of-the-art event correlation
techniques. Section 3 describes the motivation for 
serviceoriented event correlation and its benefits. After having
motivated the need for such type of correlation we use two
well-known IT service management models to gain 
requirements for an appropriate workflow modeling and present
our proposal for it (see Section 4). In Section 5 we present
our information modeling which is derived from the MNM
Service Model. An application of the approach for a web
hosting scenario is performed in Section 6. The last section
concludes the paper and presents future work.
