Non-dictatorship can be expressed as follows:
ND =
i∈Σ
¬(σ ↔ i) (1)
Lemma 1. f |=L ND iff f has the property ND1.
Independence can be expressed as follows:
IND =
o∈O
((o ∧ σ) → (o → σ)) (2)
Lemma 2. f |=L IND iff f has the property IND.
Unanimity can be expressed as follows:
UNA = ((1 ∧ · · · ∧ n) → σ) (3)
Lemma 3. f |=L UNA iff f has the property UNA.
4.1 The Discursive Paradox
As illustrated in Example 1, the following formula expresses
proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p
MV = σ ↔
G⊆Σ,|G|> n
2
i∈G
i (4)
i.e., the following property of a JAR f and admissible profile
A1, . . . , An :
p ∈ f(A1, . . . , An) ⇔ |{i : p ∈ Ai}| > |{i : p Ai}|
f |= MV exactly iff f has the above property for all judgment 
profiles and propositions.
However, we have the following in our logic. Assume that the
agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material
implication (i.e., A contains p, q, p → q for some p, q ∈ L(L)).
Proposition 1 (Discursive Paradox).
|=L (( MV) → ⊥)
when there are at least three agents and the agenda contains at
least two distinct formulae and their material implication.
Proof. Assume the opposite, e.g., that A = {p, p → q, q, ¬p,
¬(p → q), ¬q, . . .} and there exists an aggregation rule f over A
such that f |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n
2 i∈G i). Let γ be the 
judgment profile γ = A1, A2, A3 where A1 = {p, p → q, q, . . .}, A2 =
{p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, . . .} and A3 = {¬p, p → q, ¬q, . . .}. We have
that f, γ, p |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n
2 i∈G i) for any p , so f, γ, p |=L
σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n
2 i∈G i. Because f, γ, p |=L 1 ∧ 2, it follows that
f, γ, p |=L σ. In a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=L σ
and f, γ, q |=L ¬σ. In other words, p ∈ f(γ), p → q ∈ f(γ) and
q f(γ). Since f(γ) is complete, ¬q ∈ f(γ). But that contradicts
the fact that f(γ) is required to be consistent.
Proposition 1 is a logical statement of a variant of the well-known
discursive dilemma: if three agents are voting on propositions p, q
and p → q, proposition-wise majority voting might not yield a
consistent result.
