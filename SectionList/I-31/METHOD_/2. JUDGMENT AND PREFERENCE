AGGREGATION
Judgment aggregation is concerned with judgment aggregation
rules aggregating sets of logical formulae; preference aggregation
is concerned with social welfare functions aggregating preferences
over some set of alternatives. Let n be a number of agents; we write
Σ for the set {1, . . . , n}.
2.1 Judgment Aggregation Rules
Let L be a logic with language L(L). We require that the 
language has negation and material implication, with the usual 
semantics. We will sometimes refer to L as the underlying logic. An
agenda over L is a non-empty set A ⊆ L(L), where for every 
formula φ that does not start with a negation, φ ∈ A iff ¬φ ∈ A. We
sometimes call a member of A an agenda item. A subset A ⊆ A is
consistent unless A entails both ¬φ and φ in L for some φ ∈ L(L);
A is complete if either φ ∈ A or ¬φ ∈ A for every φ ∈ A which
does not start with negation. An (admissible) individual judgment
set is a complete and consistent subset Ai ⊆ A of the agenda. The
idea here is that a judgment set Ai represents the choices from A
made by agent i. Two rationality criteria demand that an agents"
choices at least be internally consistent, and that each agent makes
a decision between every item and its negation. An (admissible)
judgment profile is an n-tuple A1, . . . , An , where Ai is the 
individual judgment set of agent i. J(A, L) denotes the set of all individual
(complete and L-consistent) judgment sets over A, and J(A, L)n
the set of all judgment profiles over A. When γ ∈ J(A, L)n
, we use
γi to denote the ith element of γ, i.e., agent i"s individual judgment
set in judgment profile γ.
A judgment aggregation rule (JAR) is a function f that maps each
judgment profile A1, . . . , An to a complete and consistent 
collective judgment set f(A1, . . . , An) ∈ J(A, L). Such a rule hence is a
recipe to enforce a rational group decision, given an tuple of 
rational choices by the individual agents. Of course, such a rule should
to a certain extent be ‘fair". Some possible properties of a judgment
aggregation rule f over an agenda A:
Non-dictatorship (ND1) There is no agent i such that for every
judgment profile A1, . . . , An , f(A1, . . . , An) = Ai
Independence (IND) For any p ∈ A and judgment profiles
A1, . . . , An and B1, . . . , Bn , if for all agents i (p ∈ Ai iff
p ∈ Bi), then p ∈ f(A1, . . . , An) iff p ∈ f(B1, . . . , Bn)
Unanimity (UNA) For any judgment profile A1, . . . , An and any
p ∈ A, if p ∈ Ai for all agents i, then p ∈ f(A1, . . . , An)
2.2 Social Welfare Functions
Social welfare functions (SWFs) are usually defined in terms of
ordinal preference structures, rather than cardinal structures such as
utility functions. An SWF takes a preference relation, a binary 
relation over some set of alternatives, for each agent, and outputs 
another preference relation representing the aggregated preferences.
The most well known result about SWFs is Arrow"s theorem [1].
Many variants of the theorem appear in the literature, differing in
assumptions about the preference relations. In this paper, we take
the assumption that all preference relations are linear orders, i.e.,
that neither agents nor the aggregated preference can be indifferent
between distinct alternatives. This gives one of the simplest 
formulations of Arrow"s theorem (Theorem 1 below). Cf., e.g., [2] for a
discussion and more general formulations.
Formally, let K be a set of alternatives. We henceforth 
implicitly assume that there are always at least two alternatives. A 
preference relation (over K) is, here, a total (linear) order on K, i.e.,
a relation R over K which is antisymmetric (i.e., (a, b) ∈ R and
(b, a) ∈ R implies that a = b), transitive (i.e., (a, b) ∈ R and
(b, c) ∈ R implies that (a, c) ∈ R), and total (i.e., either (a, b) ∈
R or (b, a) ∈ R). We sometimes use the infix notation aRb for
(a, b) ∈ R. The set of preference relations over alternatives K is
denoted L(K). Alternatively, we can view L(K) as the set of all
permutations of K. Thus, we shall sometimes use a permutation of
K to denote a member of L(K). For example, when K = {a, b, c},
we will sometimes use the expression acb to denote the relation
{(a, c), (a, b), (c, b), (a, a), (b, b), (c, c)}. aRb means that b is 
preferred over a if a and b are different. Rs
denotes the irreflexive
version of R, i.e., Rs
= R \ {(a, a) : a ∈ K}. aRs
b means that b is
preferred over a and that a b.
A preference profile for Σ over alternatives K is a tuple
(R1, . . . , Rn) ∈ L(K)n
, consisting of one preference relation Ri for
each agent i. A social welfare function (SWF) is a function
F : L(K)n
→ L(K)
mapping each preference profile to an aggregated preference 
relation. The class of all SWFs over alternatives K is denoted F (K).
Properties of SWFs F corresponding to the judgment 
aggregation rule properties discussed in Section 2.1 are:

Arrow"s theorem says that the three properties above are 
inconsistent if there are more than two alternatives.
Theorem 1 (Arrow). If there are more than two alternatives,
no SWF has all the properties PO, ND2 and IIA.
