Given an underlying logic L, a finite agenda A over L, and a set
of agents Σ, Judgment Aggregation Logic (jal(L), or just jal when
L is understood) for the language L(Σ, A), is defined in Table 2.

Table 2: The logic jal(L) for the language L(Σ, A). p, pi, q range
over the agenda A; φ,ψ,ψi over L(Σ, A); x over {σ, i : i ∈ Σ};
over { , }; i, j over Σ; o over the set of outcomes O. hp means
hq when p = ¬q for some q, otherwise it means h¬p. L is the
underlying logic.
The first 5 axioms represent properties of a table and of judgment
sets. Axiom Atmost says that there is at most one item on the table
at a time, and Atleast says that we always have an item on the table.
Axiom Agenda says that every agenda item will appear on the table,
whereas Once says that every item of the agenda only appears on
the table once. Note that a conjunction hp ∧ x reads: item p is on
the agenda, and x is in favour of it, or x judges it true. Axiom CpJS
corresponds to the requirement that judgment sets are complete.
Note that from Agenda, CsJS and CpJS we derive the scheme x ∧
¬x, which says that everybody should at least express one opinion
in favour of something, and against something.
The axioms taut − 5 are well familiar from modal logic: they
directly reflect the unrestricted quantification in the truth definition
of and . Axiom C says that for any agenda item for which it
is possible to have opposing opinions, every possible outcome for
that item should be achievable. COMM says that everything that
is true for an arbitrary profile and item, is also true for an arbitrary
item and profile. Closure guarantees that agents behave 
consistently with respect to consequence in the logic L. MP and Nec are
standard. We use JAL(L) to denote derivability in jal(L).
Theorem 3. If the agenda is finite, we have that for any formula
ψ ∈ L(Σ, A), JAL(L) ψ iff |=L ψ.
Proof. Soundness is straightforward. For completeness (we 
focus on the main idea here and leave out trivial details), we build a
570 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
jal table for a consistent formula ψ as follows. In fact, our 
axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of
f. To be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of
the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. It is easy to see that table descriptions are
mutually exclusive, and, moreover, we can derive τ∈T τ, where T
is the set of all table descriptions. Let D be the set of all 
maximal consistent sets Δ. We don"t want all of those: it might well
be that ψ requires σ to be in a certain way, which is incompatible
with some Δ"s. We define two accessibility relations in the standard
way: R Δ1Δ2 iff for all ψ: ψ ∈ Δ1 ⇒ ψ ∈ Δ2. Similarly for R
with respect to . Both relations are equivalences (due to taut-5),
and moreover, when R Δ1Δ2 and R Δ2Δ3 then for some Δ2, also
R Δ1Δ2 and R Δ2Δ3 (because of axiom COMM).
Let Δ0 be a MCS containing ψ. We now define the set Tables =
{Δ0} ∪ {Δ1, Δ2 | (R Δ0Δ1 and R Δ1Δ2) or (R Δ0Δ1 and R Δ1Δ2)}
Every Δ ∈ Tables can be conceived as a pair γ, p, since every Δ
contains a unique (hq ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ) for every hq and a unique hp.
It is then easy to verify that, for every Δ ∈ Tables, and every
formula ϕ, Δ |= ϕ iff ϕ ∈ Δ, where |= here means truth in the
ordinary modal logic sense when the set of states is taken to be
Tables. Now, we extract an aggregation function f and pairs γ, p as
follows:
For every Δ ∈ Tables, find a conjunction hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. There
will be exactly one such p. This defines the p we are looking for.
Furthermore, the γ is obtained, for every agent i, by finding all q for
which (hq ∧ i) is currently true. Finally, the function f is a table
of all tuples hp, o(p), σ for which (hp ∧ o(o) ∧ σ) is contained in
some set in Tables.
We point out that jal has all the axioms taut, K, T, 4, 5 and the
rules MP and Nec of the modal logic S5. However, uniform 
substitution, a principle of all normal modal logics (cf., e.g., [3]), does
not hold. A counter example is the fact that the following is valid:
σ (5)
- no matter what preferences the agents have, the JAR will always
make some judgment - while this is not valid:
(σ ∧ i) (6)
- the JAR will not necessarily make the same judgments as agent i.
So, for example, we have that the discursive paradox is provable
in jal(L): JAL(L) (( MV) → ⊥). An example of a derivation of
the less complicated (valid) property (i ∧ j) is shown in Table 3.
