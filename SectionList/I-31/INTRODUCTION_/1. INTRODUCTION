In this paper, we are interested in knowledge representation 
formalisms for systems in which agents need to aggregate their 
preferences, judgments, beliefs, etc. For example, an agent may need
to reason about majority voting in a group he is a member of. 
Preference aggregation - combining individuals" preference relations
over some set of alternatives into a preference relation which 
represents the joint preferences of the group by so-called social 
welfare functions - has been extensively studied in social choice theory
[2]. The recently emerging field of judgment aggregation studies
aggregation from a logical perspective, and discusses how, given
a consistent set of logical formulae for each agent, representing
the agent"s beliefs or judgments, we can aggregate these to a 
single consistent set of formulae. A variety of judgment aggregation
rules have been developed to this end. As a special case, judgment
aggregation can be seen to subsume preference aggregation [5].
In this paper we present a logic, called Judgment Aggregation
Logic (jal), for reasoning about judgment aggregation. The 
formulae of the logic are interpreted as statements about judgment 
aggregation rules, and we give a sound and complete axiomatisation of
all such rules. The axiomatisation is parameterised in such a way
that we can instantiate it to get a range of different judgment 
aggregation logics. For example, one instance is an axiomatisation, in
our language, of all social welfare functions - thus we get a logic
of classical preference aggregation as well. And this is one of the
main contributions of this paper: we identify the logical properties
of judgment aggregation, and we can compare the logical 
properties of different classes of judgment aggregation - and of general
judgment aggregation and preference aggregation in particular.
Of course, a logic is only interesting as long as it is 
expressive. One of the goals of this paper is to investigate the 
representational and logical capabilities an agent needs for judgment and
preference aggregation; that is, what kind of logical language might
be used to represent and reason about judgment aggregation? An
agent"s knowledge representation language should be able to 
express: common aggregation rules such as majority voting; 
commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules and 
social welfare functions such as independence; paradoxes commonly
used to illustrate judgment aggregation and preference aggregation,
viz. the discursive paradox and Condorcet"s paradox respectively;
and other important properties such as Arrow"s theorem. In order
to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be
able to express, take the example of a potential property of social
welfare functions (SWFs) called independence of irrelevant 
alternatives (IIA): given two preference profiles (each consisting of one
preference relation for each agent) and two alternatives, if for each
agent the two alternatives have the same order in the two preference
profiles, then the two alternatives must have the same order in the
two preference relations resulting from applying the SWF to the
two preference profiles, respectively. From this example it seems
that a formal language for SWFs should be able to express:

• Quantification on several levels: over alternatives; over 
preference profiles, i.e., over relations over alternatives 
(secondorder quantification); and over agents.
• Properties of preference relations for different agents, and
properties of several different preference relations for the same
agent in the same formula.
• Comparison of different preference relations.
• The preference relation resulting from applying a SWF to
other preference relations.
From these points it might seem that such a language would be
rather complex (in particular, these requirements seem to rule out a
standard propositional modal logic). Perhaps surprisingly, the 
language of jal is syntactically and semantically rather simple; and yet
the language is, nevertheless, expressive enough to give elegant and
succinct expressions of, e.g., IIA, majority voting, the discursive
dilemma, Condorcet"s paradox and Arrow"s theorem. This means,
for example, that Arrow"s theorem is a formal theorem of jal, i.e.,
a derivable formula; we thus have a formal proof theory for social
choice.
The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. In the next
section we review the basics of judgment aggregation as well as
preference aggregation, and mention some commonly discussed
properties of judgment aggregation rules and social welfare 
functions. In Section 3 we introduce the syntax and semantics of jal,
and study the complexity of the model checking problem. 
Formulae of jal are interpreted directly by, and thus represent properties
of, judgment aggregation rules. In Section 4 we demonstrate that
the logic can express commonly discussed properties of judgment
aggregation rules, such as the discursive paradox. We give a sound
and complete axiomatisation of the logic in Section 5, under the 
assumption that the agenda the agents make judgments over is finite.
As mentioned above, preference aggregation can be seen as a 
special case of judgment aggregation, and in Section 6 we introduce an
alternative interpretation of jal formulae directly in social welfare
functions. We obtain a sound and complete axiomatisation of the
logic for preference aggregation as well. Sections 7 and 8 discusses
related work and concludes.
