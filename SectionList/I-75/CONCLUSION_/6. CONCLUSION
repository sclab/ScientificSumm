This paper has investigated the properties of a 
multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives
its environment, and tries to reach consistency with other
agents despite severe communication restrictions. In 
particular we have exhibited conditions allowing convergence, and
experimentally investigated a typical situation where those
conditions cannot hold. There are many possible extensions
to this work, the first being to further investigate the 
properties of different global protocols belonging to the class we
identified, and their influence on the outcome. There are in
particular many heuristics, highly dependent on the context
of the study, that could intuitively yield interesting results
(in our study, selecting the recipient on the basis of what can
be inferred from his observed actions could be such a 
heuristic). One obvious candidate for longer term issues concern
the relaxation of the assumption of perfect sensing.
