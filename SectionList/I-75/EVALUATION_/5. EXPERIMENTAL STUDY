This experiment involves agents trying to escape from a
burning building. The environment is described as a spatial
grid with a set of walls and (thankfully) some exits. Time
and space are considered discrete. Time is divided in rounds.
Agents are localised by their position on the spatial grid.
These agents can move and communicate with other agents.
In a round, an agent can move of one cell in any of the four
cardinal directions, provided it is not blocked by a wall. In
this application, agents communicate with any other agent
(but, recall, a single one) given that this agent is in view,
and that they have not yet exchanged their current favoured
hypothesis. Suddenly, a fire erupts in these premises. From
this moment, the fire propagates. Each round, for each cases
where there is fire, the fire propagates in the four directions.
However, the fire cannot propagate through a wall. If the
fire propagates in a case where an agent is positioned, that
agent burns and is considered dead. It can of course no
longer move nor communicate. If an agent gets to an exit,
it is considered saved, and can no longer be burned. Agents
know the environment and the rules governing the 
dynamics of this environment, that is, they know the map as well
as the rules of fire propagation previously described. They
also locally perceive this environment, but cannot see 
further than 3 cases away, in any direction. Walls also block
the line of view, preventing agents from seeing behind them.
Within their sight, they can see other agents and whether
or not the cases they see are on fire. All these perceptions
are memorised.
We now show how this instantiates the abstract 
framework presented the paper.
• O = {Fire(x, y, t), NoFire(x, y, t), Agent(ai, x, y, t)}
Observations can then be positive (o ∈ P(O) iff ∃h ∈
H s.t. h |= o) or negative (o ∈ N(O) iff ∃h ∈ H s.t.
h |= ¬o).
• H={FireOrigin(x1, y1, t1)∧...∧FireOrigin(xl, yl, tl)}
Hypotheses are conjunctions of FireOrigins.
• Cons(h, O) consistency relation satisfies:
- coherence : ∀o ∈ N(O), h |= ¬o.
- completeness : ∀o ∈ P(O), h |= o.
- minimality : For all h ∈ H, if h is coherent and
complete for O, then h is prefered to h according
to the preference relation (h ≤p h ).2

Selects first the minimal number of origins, then the most
recent (least preemptive strategy [6]), then uses some 
arbitrary fixed ranking to discriminate ex-aequo. The resulting
relation is a total order, hence minimality implies that there
will be a single h s.t.Cons(O, h) for a given O. This in
turn means that MCons(ai, aj) iff Cons(ai), Cons(aj), and
hi = hj. This relation is then transitive and symmetric.

5.1 Experimental Evaluation
We will classically (see e.g. [3, 4]) assess the effectiveness
and efficiency of different interaction protocols.
Effectiveness of a protocol
The proportion of agents surviving the fire over the initial
number of agents involved in the experiment will determine
the effectiveness of a given protocol. If this value is high,
the protocol has been effective to propagate the information
and/or for the agents to refine their hypotheses and 
determine the best way to the exit.
Efficiency of a protocol
Typically, the use of supporting information will involve a
communication overhead. We will assume here that the 
efficiency of a given protocol is characterised by the data flow
induced by this protocol. In this paper we will only discuss
this aspect wrt. local protocols. The main measure that we
shall then use here is the mean total size of messages that
are exchanged by agents per exchange (hence taking into 
account both the number of messages and the actual size of the
messages, because it could be that messages happen to be
very big, containing e.g. a large number of observations,
which could counter-balance a low number of messages).
5.2 Experimental Settings
The chosen experimental settings are the following:
• Environmental topology- Performances of 
information propagation are highly constrained by the 
environment topology. The perception skills of the agents
depend on the openness of the environment. With
a large number of walls the perceptions of agents are
limited, and also the number of possible inter-agent
communications, whereas an open environment will
provide optimal possibilities of perception and 
information propagation. Thus, we propose a topological
index (see below) as a common basis to charaterize the
environments (maps) used during experimentations.
The topological index (TI) is the ratio of the number of
cells that can be perceived by agents summed up from
all possible positions, divided by the number of cells
that would be perceived from the same positions but
without any walls. (The closer to 1, the more open the
environment). We shall also use two additional, more
classical [10], measures: the characteristic path length3
(CPL) and the clustering coefficient4
(CC).
• Number of agents- The propagation of information
also depends on the initial number of agents involved
during an experimentation. For instance, the more
agents, the more potential communications there is.
This means that there will be more potential for 
propagation, but also that the bilateral exchange restriction
will be more crucial.

• Initial positions of the agents- Initial positions of the
agents have a significant influence on the overall 
behavior of an instance of our system: being close from
an exit will (in general) ease the escape.
5.3 Experimental environments
We choose to realize experiments on three very 
different topological indexes (69% for open environments, 53%
for mixed environments, and 38% for labyrinth-like 
environments).
Figure 2: Two maps (left: TI=69%, right TI=38%)
We designed three different maps for each index (Fig. 2
shows two of them), containing the same maximum number
of agents (36 agents max.) with a maximum density of one
agent per cell, the same number of exits and a similar fire
origin (e.g. starting time and position). The three differents
maps of a given index are designed as follows. The first map
is a model of an existing building floor. The second map has
the same enclosure, exits and fire origin as the first one,
but the number and location of walls are different (wall 
locations are designed by an heuristic which randomly creates
walls on the spatial grid such that no fully closed rooms are
created and that no exit is closed). The third map is 
characterised by geometrical enclosure in wich walls location
is also designed with the aforementioned heuristic. Table 1
summarizes the different topological measures 
characterizing these different maps. It is worth pointing out that the
values confirm the relevance of TI (maps with a high TI
have a low CPL and a high CC. However the CPL and CC
allows to further refine the difference between the maps, e.g.
between 53-1 and 53-2).
5.4 Experimental Results
For each triple of maps defined as above we conduct the
same experiments. In each experiment, the society differs in
terms of its initial proportion of involved agents, from 1%
to 100%. This initial proportion represents the percentage
of involved agents with regards to the possible maximum
number of agents. For each map and each initial proportion,
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1003
we select randomly 100 different initial agents" locations.
For each of those different locations we execute the system
one time for each different interaction protocol.
Effectiveness of Communication and Argumentation
The first experiment that we set up aims at testing how 
effective is hypotheses exchange (HE), and in particular how
the topological aspects will affect this effectiveness. In order
to do so, we have computed the ratio of improvement offered
by that protocol over a situation where agents could simply
not communicate (no comm). To get further insights as
to what extent the hypotheses exchange was really crucial,
we also tested a much less elaborated protocol consisting
of mere observation exchanges (OE). More precisely, this
protocol requires that each agent stores any unexpected
observation that it perceives, and agents simply exchange
their respective lists of observations when they discuss. In
this case, the local protocol is different (note in 
particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the
global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that
agents" motivation to communicate is to synchronise their
list of observations, not their hypothesis). If this protocol is
at best as effective as HE, it has the advantage of being more
efficient (this is obvious wrt the number of messages which
will be limited to 2, less straightforward as far as the size of
messages is concerned, but the rough observation that the
exchange of observations can be viewed as a flat version
of the challenge is helpful to see this). The results of these
experiments are reported in Fig. 3.
Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of
protocols when the proportion of agents augments
The first observation that needs to be made is that 
communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and
this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the
system. The second lesson that we learn here is that 
closeness relatively makes communication more effective over non
communication. Maps exhibiting a T.I. of 38% are 
constantly above the two others, and 53% are still slightly but
significantly better than 69%. However, these curves also
suggest, perhaps surprisingly, that HE outperforms OE in
precisely those situations where the ratio gain is less 
important (the only noticeable difference occurs for rather open
maps where T.I. is 69%). This may be explained as follows:
when a map is open, agents have many potential explanation
candidates, and argumentation becomes useful to 
discriminate between those. When a map is labyrinth-like, there are
fewer possible explanations to an unexpected event.
Importance of the Global Protocol
The second set of experiments seeks to evaluate the 
importance of the design of the global protocol. We tested our
protocol against a local broadcast (LB) protocol. Local
broadcast means that all the neighbours agents perceived
by an agent will be involved in a communication with that
agent in a given round -we alleviate the constraint of a 
single communication by agent. This gives us a rough upper
bound upon the possible ratio gain in the system (for a given
local protocol). Again, we evaluated the ratio gain induced
by that LB over our classical HE, for the three different
classes of maps. The results are reported in Fig. 4.
Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over 
hypotheses exchange
Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the 
proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact
that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.
We first observe that all classes of maps witness a ratio
gain increasing when the proportion of agents augments: the
gain reaches 10 to 20%, depending on the class of maps 
considered. If one compares this with the improvement reported
in the previous experiment, it appears to be of the same
magnitude. This illustrates that the design of the global
protocol cannot be ignored, especially when the proportion
of agents is high. However, we also note that the 
effectiveness ratio gain curves have very different shapes in both
cases: the gain induced by the accuracy of the local protocol
increases very quickly with the proportion of agents, while
the curve is really smooth for the global one.
Now let us observe more carefully the results reported
here: the curve corresponding to a TI of 53% is above that
corresponding to 38%. This is so because the more open
a map, the more opportunities to communicate with more
than one agent (and hence benefits from broadcast). 
However, we also observe that curve for 69% is below that for
53%. This is explained as follows: in the case of 69%, the
potential gain to be made in terms of surviving agents is
much lower, because our protocols already give rather 
efficient outcomes anyway (quickly reaching 90%, see Fig. 3).
A simple rule of thumb could be that when the number of
agents is small, special attention should be put on the local
1004 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
protocol, whereas when that number is large, one should
carefully design the global one (unless the map is so open
that the protocol is already almost optimally efficient).
Efficiency of the Protocols
The final experiment reported here is concerned with the
analysis of the efficiency of the protocols. We analysis here
the mean size of the totality of the messages that are 
exchanged by agents (mean size of exchanges, for short) using
the following protocols: HE, OE, and two variant 
protocols. The first one is an intermediary restricted hypotheses
exchange protocol (RHE). RHE is as follows: it does not 
involve any challenge nor counter-propose, which means that
agents cannot switch their role during the protocol (this 
differs from RE in that respect). In short, RHE allows an agent
to exhaust its partner"s criticism, and eventually this 
partner will come to adopt the agent"s hypothesis. Note that this
means that the autonomy of the agent is not preserved here
(as an agent will essentially accept any hypothesis it cannot
undermine), with the hope that the gain in efficiency will be
significant enough to compensate a loss in effectiveness. The
second variant protocol is a complete observation exchange
protocol (COE). COE uses the same principles as OE, but
includes in addition all critical negative examples (nofire) in
the exchange (thus giving all examples used as arguments
by the hypotheses exchanges protocol), hence improving 
effectiveness. Results for map 69-1 are shown on Fig. 5.
Figure 5: Mean size of exchanges
First we can observe the fact that the ordering of the 
protocols, from the least efficient to the most efficient, is COE,
HE, RHE and then OE. HE being more efficient than COE
proves that the argumentation process gains efficiency by 
selecting when it is needed to provide negative example, which
have less impact that positive ones in our specific testbed.
However, by communicating hypotheses before eventually
giving observation to support it (HE) instead of directly 
giving the most crucial observations (OE), the argumentation
process doubles the size of data exchanges. It is the cost for
ensuring consistency at the end of the exchange (a property
that OE does not support). Also significant is the fact the
the mean size of exchanges is slightly higher when the 
number of agents is small. This is explained by the fact that in
these cases only a very few agents have relevant informations
in their possession, and that they will need to communicate
a lot in order to come up with a common view of the 
situation. When the number of agents increases, this knowledge
is distributed over more agents which need shorter 
discussions to get to mutual consistency. As a consequence, the
relative gain in efficiency of using RHE appears to be better
when the number of agents is small: when it is high, they
will hardly argue anyway. Finally, it is worth noticing that
the standard deviation for these experiments is rather high,
which means that the conversation do not converge to any
stereotypic pattern.
