Query performance prediction has many applications in a variety
of information retrieval (IR) areas such as improving retrieval
consistency, query refinement, and distributed IR. The importance
of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a
number of new methods have been proposed for prediction
recently [1, 2, 17].
Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc
retrieval task where query performance is measured according to
topical relevance. These prediction models are evaluated on
TREC document collections which typically consist of no more
than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles. With
the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques
that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.
However, web search environments pose significant challenges to
current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional
TREC settings. Here we outline some of these challenges.
First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional
TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are
different in many aspects such as quality and style. Current
prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of
web collections. For example, the reported prediction accuracy of
the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the
GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse
compared to the other TREC collections [1]. Similar prediction
accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is
reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query
performance on a large web collection.
Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc
retrieval task based on topical relevance. For example, the
Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is
also popular in web retrieval. Query performance prediction for
the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far
from perfect. In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the
2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform
poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the
best run from the top group. To our knowledge, little research has
explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance
prediction. Current prediction models devised for content-based
queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the
fundamental differences between the two.
Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are
usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the
type of each query is generally unavailable. The mixed-query
situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.
For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into
prediction models. Despite these problems, the ability to handle
this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance
prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool
for web retrieval.
In this paper, we present three techniques to address the above
challenges that current prediction models face in Web search
environments. Our work focuses on query performance prediction
for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page
finding task in the context of web retrieval. Our first technique,
called weighted information gain (WIG), makes use of both single
term and term proximity features to estimate the quality of top
retrieved documents for prediction. We find that WIG offers
consistent prediction accuracy across various test collections and
query types. Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction
accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using
WIG with the help of a query type classifier. Query feedback and
first rank change, which are our second and third prediction
techniques, perform well for content-based queries and NP
queries respectively.
Our main contributions include: (1) considerably improved
prediction accuracy for web content-based queries over several
state-of-the-art techniques. (2) new techniques for successfully
predicting NP-query performance. (3) a practical and fully
automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance. In
addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the
robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for
performance prediction, is helpful for query classification.
