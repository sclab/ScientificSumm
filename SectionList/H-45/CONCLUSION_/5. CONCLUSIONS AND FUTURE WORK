To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore
prediction of query performance in web search environments. We
demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction
accuracy than previously published techniques not specially
devised for web search scenarios. In this paper, we focus on two
types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page
(NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task
and the Named-Page finding task respectively. For both types of
web queries, our prediction models were shown to be
substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art
techniques. Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that
no prior information on query types is available. We
demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this
situation. Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of
collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply
this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic
data collected from a commercial search engine.
Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction
techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.
Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms
and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be
made very efficient with the support of index. On the other hand,
the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since
QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to
repeatedly rank the perturbed documents. How to improve the
efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.
In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have
the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining
with other IR techniques. For example, our techniques can be
incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as
query expansion and query relaxation. Guided by performance
prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to
modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness. We would like
to carry out research in this direction in the future.
