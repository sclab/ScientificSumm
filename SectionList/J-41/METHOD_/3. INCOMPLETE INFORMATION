3.1 Incentives
It should be clear that with a first-price payment rule,
truthful bidding is neither a dominant strategy nor an ex
post Nash equilibrium using either RBB or RBR, because
this guarantees a payoff of 0. There is always an incentive
to shade true values with first pricing.
The second-price payment rule is reminiscent of the 
secondprice (Vickrey) auction used for selling a single item, and in
a Vickrey auction it is a dominant strategy for a bidder to
reveal his true value for the item [19]. However, using a
second-price rule in a slot auction together with either 
allocation rule above does not yield an incentive-compatible
mechanism, either in dominant strategies or ex post Nash
equilibrium.12
With a second-price rule there is no 
incentive for a bidder to bid higher than his true value per click
using either RBB or RBR: this either leads to no change
11
We are effectively assuming a reserve price of zero, but in
practice search engines charge a non-zero reserve price per
click.

Unless of course there is only a single slot available, since
this is the single-item case. With a single slot both RBB
and RBR with a second-price payment rule are 
dominantstrategy incentive-compatible.
in the outcome, or a situation in which he will have to pay
more than his value per click for each click received, 
resulting in a negative payoff.13
However, with either allocation
rule there may be an incentive to shade true values with
second pricing.
Claim 1. With second pricing and K ≥ 2, truthful 
bidding is not a dominant strategy nor an ex post Nash 
equilibrium for either RBB or RBR.
Example. There are two agents and two slots. The
agents have relevance α1 = α2 = 1, whereas γ1 = 1 and
γ2 = 1/2. Agent 1 has a value of x1 = 6 per click, and agent
2 has a value of x2 = 4 per click. Let us first consider the
RBB rule. Suppose agent 2 bids truthfully. If agent 1 also
bids truthfully, he wins the first slot and obtains a payoff of
2. However, if he shades his bid down below 4, he obtains
the second slot at a cost of 0 per click yielding a payoff of
3. Since the agents have equal relevance, the exact same
situation holds with the RBR rule. Hence truthful bidding
is not a dominant strategy in either format, and neither is
it an ex post Nash equilibrium.
To find payments that make RBB and RBR 
dominantstrategy incentive-compatible, we can apply Holmstrom"s
lemma [9] (see also chapter 3 in Milgrom [15]). Under the
restriction that a bidder with value 0 per click does not pay
anything (even if he obtains a slot, which can occur if there
are as many slots as bidders), this lemma implies that there
is a unique payment rule that achieves dominant-strategy
incentive compatibility for either allocation rule. For RBB,
the bidder allocated slot k is charged per click
KX
i=k+1
(γi−1 − γi)˜x(i)
+ γK ˜x(K+1)
(1)
Note that if K = N, ˜x(K+1)
= 0 since there is no K + 1th
bidder. For RBR, the bidder allocated slot k is charged per
click
1
ασ(k)
KX
i=k+1
(γi−1 − γi)˜r(i)
+ γK ˜r(K+1)
!
(2)
Using payment rule (2) and RBR, the auctioneer is aware
of the true revenues of the bidders (since they reveal their
values truthfully), and hence ranks them according to their
true revenues. We show in Section 3.3 that this allocation
is in fact efficient. Since the VCG mechanism is the unique
mechanism that is efficient, truthful, and ensures bidders
with value 0 pay nothing (by the Green-Laffont theorem [8]),
the RBR rule and payment scheme (2) constitute exactly the
VCG mechanism.
In the VCG mechanism an agent pays the externality he
imposes on others. To understand payment (2) in this sense,
note that the first term is the added utility (due to an 
increased clickthrough rate) agents in slots k + 1 to K would
receive if they were all to move up a slot; the last term is the
utility that the agent with the K +1st
revenue would receive
by obtaining the last slot as opposed to nothing. The 
leading coefficient simply reduces the agent"s expected payment
to a payment per click.
13
In a dynamic setting with second pricing, there may be an
incentive to bid higher than one"s true value in order to 
exhaust competitors" budgets. This phenomenon is commonly
called bid jamming or antisocial bidding [4].

3.2 Equilibrium Analysis
To understand the efficiency and revenue properties of
the various auction formats, we must first understand which
rankings of the bidders occur in equilibrium with different
allocation and payment rule combinations. The following
lemma essentially follows from the Monotonic Selection 
Theorem by Milgrom and Shannon [16].
Lemma 1. In a RBB (RBR) auction with either a 
firstor second-price payment rule, the symmetric Bayes-Nash
equilibrium bid is strictly increasing with value ( revenue).
As a consequence of this lemma, we find that RBB and
RBR auctions allocate the slots greedily by the true values
and revenues of the agents, respectively (whether using 
firstor second-price payment rules). This will be relevant in
Section 3.3 below. For a first-price payment rule, we can
explicitly derive the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid
functions for RBB and RBR auctions. The purpose of this
exercise is to lend qualitative insights into the parameters
that influence an agent"s bidding, and to derive formulae for
the expected revenue in RBB and RBR auctions in order
to make a revenue ranking of these two allocation rules (in
Section 3.4).
Let G(y) be the expected resulting clickthrough rate, in
a symmetric equilibrium of the RBB auction (with either
payment rule), to a bidder with value y and relevance α =
1. Let H(y) be the analogous quantity for a bidder with
revenue y and relevance 1 in a RBR auction. By Lemma 1,
a bidder with value y will obtain slot k in a RBB auction
if y is the kth
highest of the true realized values. The same
applies in a RBR auction when y is the kth
highest of the true
realized revenues. Let FX (y) be the distribution function for
value, and let FR(y) be the distribution function for revenue.
The probability that y is the kth
highest out of N values is
N − 1
k − 1
!
(1 − FX (y))k−1
FX (y)N−k
whereas the probability that y is the kth
highest out of N
revenues is the same formula with FR replacing FX . Hence
we have
G(y) =
KX
k=1
γk
N − 1
k − 1
!
(1 − FX (y))k−1
FX (y)N−k
The H function is analogous to G with FR replacing FX .
In the two propositions that follow, g and h are the 
derivatives of G and H respectively. We omit the proof of the
next proposition, because it is almost identical to the 
derivation of the equilibrium bid in the single-item case (see 
Krishna [11], Proposition 2.2).
Proposition 1. The symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium
strategies in a first-price RBB auction are given by
˜xB
(x, α) =
1
G(x)
Z x
0
y g(y)dy
The first-price equilibrium above closely parallels the 
firstprice equilibrium in the single-item model. With a single
item g is the density of the second highest value among all
N agent values, whereas in a slot auction it is a weighted
combination of the densities for the second, third, etc. 
highest values.
Note that the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid in
a first-price RBB auction does not depend on a bidder"s
relevance α. To see clearly why, note that a bidder chooses
a bid b so as to maximize the objective
αG(˜x−1
(b))(x − b)
and here α is just a leading constant factor. So dropping
it does not change the set of optimal solutions. Hence the
equilibrium bid depends only on the value x and function
G, and G in turn depends only on the marginal cumulative
distribution of value FX . So really only the latter needs to
be common knowledge to the bidders. On the other hand,
we will now see that information about relevance is needed
for bidders to play the equilibrium in the first-price RBR
auction. So the informational requirements for a first-price
RBB auction are much weaker than for a first-price RBR
auction: in the RBB auction a bidder need not know his own
relevance, and need not know any distributional information
over others" relevance in order to play the equilibrium.
Again we omit the next proposition"s proof since it is so
similar to the one above.
Proposition 2. The symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium
strategies in a first-price RBR auction are given by
˜xR
(x, α) =
1
αH(αx)
Z αx
0
y h(y) dy
Here it can be seen that the equilibrium bid is increasing
with x, but not necessarily with α. This should not be much
of a concern to the auctioneer, however, because in any case
the declared revenue in equilibrium is always increasing in
the true revenue.
It would be interesting to obtain the equilibrium bids
when using a second-price payment rule, but it appears that
the resulting differential equations for this case do not have a
neat analytical solution. Nonetheless, the same conclusions
about the informational requirements of the RBB and RBR
rules still hold, as can be seen simply by inspecting the 
objective function associated with an agent"s bidding problem
for the second-price case.
3.3 Efficiency
A slot auction is efficient if in equilibrium the sum of the
bidders" revenues from their allocated slots is maximized.
Using symmetry as our equilibrium selection criterion, we
find that the RBB auction is not efficient with either 
payment rule.
Claim 2. The RBB auction is not efficient with either
first or second pricing.
Example. There are two agents and one slot, with γ1 =
1. Agent 1 has a value of x1 = 6 per click and relevance
α1 = 1/2. Agent 2 has a value of x2 = 4 per click and
relevance α2 = 1. By Lemma 1, agents are ranked greedily
by value. Hence agent 1 obtains the lone slot, for a total
revenue of 3 to the agents. However, it is most efficient to
allocate the slot to agent 2, for a total revenue of 4.
Examples with more agents or more slots are simple to
construct along the same lines. On the other hand, under
our assumptions on how clickthrough rate decreases with
lower rank, the RBR auction is efficient with either payment
rule.
222
Theorem 1. The RBR auction is efficient with either
first- or second-price payments rules.
Proof. Since by Lemma 1 the agents" equilibrium bids
are increasing functions of their revenues in the RBR 
auction, slots are allocated greedily according to true revenues.
Let σ be a non-greedy allocation. Then there are slots s, t
with s < t and rσ(s) < rσ(t). We can switch the agents in
slots s and t to obtain a new allocation, and the difference
between the total revenue in this new allocation and the
original allocation"s total revenue is
`
γtrσ(s) + γsrσ(t)
´
−
`
γsrσ(s) + γtrσ(t)
´
= (γs − γt)
`
rσ(t) − rσ(s)
´
Both parenthesized terms above are positive. Hence the
switch has increased the total revenue to the bidders. If we
continue to perform such switches, we will eventually reach
a greedy allocation of greater revenue than the initial 
allocation. Since the initial allocation was arbitrary, it follows
that a greedy allocation is always efficient, and hence the
RBR auction"s allocation is efficient.
Note that the assumption that clickthrough rate decays
montonically by the same factors γ1, . . . , γK for all agents is
crucial to this result. A greedy allocation scheme does not
necessarily find an efficient solution if the clickthrough rates
are monotonically decreasing in an independent fashion for
each agent.
3.4 Revenue
To obtain possible revenue rankings for the different 
auction formats, we first note that when the allocation rule is
fixed to RBB, then using either a first-price, second-price, or
truthful payment rule leads to the same expected revenue in
a symmetric, increasing Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Because
a RBB auction ranks agents by their true values in 
equilibrium for any of these payment rules (by Lemma 1), it
follows that expected revenue is the same for all these 
payment rules, following arguments that are virtually identical
to those used to establish revenue equivalence in the 
singleitem case (see e.g. Proposition 3.1 in Krishna [11]). The
same holds for RBR auctions; however, the revenue ranking
of the RBB and RBR allocation rules is still unclear. 
Because of this revenue equivalence principle, we can choose
whichever payment rule is most convenient for the purpose
of making revenue comparisons.
Using Propositions 1 and 2, it is a simple matter to 
derive formulae for the expected revenue under both allocation
rules. The payment of an agent in a RBB auction is
mB
(x, α) = αG(x)˜xV
(x, α)
The expected revenue is then N · E
ˆ
mV
(X, A)
˜
, where the
expectation is taken with respect to the joint density of value
and relevance. The expected revenue formula for RBR 
auctions is entirely analogous using ˜xR
(x, α) and the H 
function. With these in hand we can obtain revenue rankings
for specific numbers of bidders and slots, and specific 
distributions over values and relevance.
Claim 3. For fixed K, N, and fixed γ1, . . . , γK, no 
revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible for an arbitrary
density f.
Example. Assume there are 2 bidders, 2 slots, and that
γ1 = 1, γ2 = 1/2. Assume that value-relevance pairs are
uniformly distributed over [0, 1]× [0, 1]. For such a 
distribution with a closed-form formula, it is most convenient to use
the revenue formulae just derived. RBB dominates RBR in
terms of revenue for these parameters. The formula for the
expected revenue in a RBB auction yields 1/12, whereas for
RBR auctions we have 7/108.
Assume instead that with probability 1/2 an agent"s 
valuerelevance pair is (1, 1/2), and that with probability 1/2 it
is (1/2, 1). In this scenario it is more convenient to appeal
to formulae (1) and (2). In a truthful auction the second
agent will always pay 0. According to (1), in a truthful
RBB auction the first agent makes an expected payment of
E
ˆ
(γ1 − γ2)Aσ(1)Xσ(2)
˜
=
1
2
E
ˆ
Aσ(1)
˜
E
ˆ
Xσ(2)
˜
where we have used the fact that value and relevance are
independently distributed for different agents. The expected
relevance of the agent with the highest value is E
ˆ
Aσ(1)
˜
=
5/8. The expected second highest value is also E
ˆ
Xσ(2)
˜
=
5/8. The expected revenue for a RBB auction here is then
25/128. According to (2), in a truthful RBR auction the
first agent makes an expected payment of
E
ˆ
(γ1 − γ2)Rσ(2)
˜
=
1
2
E
ˆ
Rσ(2)
˜
In expectation the second highest revenue is E
ˆ
Rσ(2)
˜
=
1/2, so the expected revenue for a RBR auction is 1/4.
Hence in this case the RBR auction yields higher expected
revenue.1415
This example suggests the following conjecture: when
value and relevance are either uncorrelated or positively 
correlated, RBB dominates RBR in terms of revenue. When
value and relevance are negatively correlated, RBR 
dominates.
