In typical slot auctions such as those run by Yahoo! and
Google, bidders can adjust their bids up or down at any
time. As B¨orgers et al. [2] and Edelman et al. [6] have
noted, this can be viewed as a continuous-time process in
which bidders learn each other"s bids. If the process 
stabilizes the result can then be modeled as a Nash equilibrium
in pure strategies of the static one-shot game of complete 
information, since each bidder will be playing a best-response
to the others" bids.16
This argument seems especially 
appropriate for Yahoo!"s slot auction design where all bids are
14
To be entirely rigorous and consistent with our initial 
assumptions, we should have constructed a continuous 
probability density with full support over an appropriate domain.
Taking the domain to be e.g. [0, 1] × [0, 1] and a continuous
density with full support that is sufficiently concentrated
around (1, 1/2) and (1/2, 1), with roughly equal mass around
both, would yield the same conclusion.
15
Claim 3 should serve as a word of caution, because Feng
et al. [7] find through their simulations that with a 
bivariate normal distribution over value-relevance pairs, and with
5 slots, 15 bidders, and δ = 2, RBR dominates RBB in
terms of revenue for any level of correlation between value
and relevance. However, they assume that bidding behavior
in a second-price slot auction can be well approximated by
truthful bidding.

We do not claim that bidders will actually learn each 
others" private information (value and relevance), just that for
a stable set of bids there is a corresponding equilibrium of
the complete information game.

made public. Google keeps bids private, but 
experimentation can allow one to discover other bids, especially since
second pricing automatically reveals to an agent the bid of
the agent ranked directly below him.
4.1 Equilibrium Analysis
In this section we ask whether a pure-strategy Nash 
equilibrium exists in a RBB or RBR slot auction, with either
first or second pricing.
Before dealing with the first-price case there is a technical
issue involving ties. In our model we allow bids to be 
nonnegative real numbers for mathematical convenience, but
this can become problematic because there is then no bid
that is just higher than another. We brush over such
issues by assuming that an agent can bid infinitesimally
higher than another. This is imprecise but allows us to
focus on the intuition behind the result that follows. See
Reny [17] for a full treatment of such issues.
For the remainder of the paper, we assume that there are
as many slots as bidders. The following result shows that
there can be no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with first
pricing.17
Note that the argument holds for both RBB and
RBR allocation rules. For RBB, bids should be interpreted
as declared values, and for RBR as declared revenues.
Theorem 2. There exists no complete information Nash
equilibrium in pure strategies in the first-price slot auction,
for any possible values of the agents, whether using a RBB
or RBR allocation rule.
Proof. Let σ : [K] → [N] be the allocation of slots to
the agents resulting from their bids. Let ri and bi be the
revenue and bid of the agent ranked ith
, respectively. Note
that we cannot have bi > bi+1, or else the agent in slot
i can make a profitable deviation by instead bidding bi −
> bi+1 for small enough > 0. This does not change
its allocation, but increases its profit. Hence we must have
bi = bi+1 (i.e. with one bidder bidding infinitesimally higher
than the other). Since this holds for any two consecutive
bidders, it follows that in a Nash equilibrium all bidders
must be bidding 0 (since the bidder ranked last matches the
bid directly below him, which is 0 by default because there
is no such bid). But this is impossible: consider the bidder
ranked last. The identity of this bidder is always clear given
the deterministic tie-breaking rule. This bidder can obtain
the top spot and increase his revenue by (γ1 −γK)rK > 0 by
bidding some > 0, and for small enough this is necessarily
a profitable deviation. Hence there is no Nash equilibrium
in pure strategies.
On the other hand, we find that in a second-price slot 
auction there can be a multitude of pure strategy Nash 
equilibria. The next two lemmas give conditions that characterize
the allocations that can occur as a result of an equilibrium
profile of bids, given fixed agent values and revenues. Then
if we can exhibit an allocation that satisfies these conditions,
there must exist at least one equilibrium. We first consider
the RBR case.
17
B¨orgers et al. [2] have proven this result in a model with
three bidders and three slots, and we generalize their 
argument. Edelman et al. [6] also point out this non-existence
phenomenon. They only illustrate the fact with an example
because the result is quite immediate.

equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBR
slot auction if and only if

rσ(i) ≤ rσ(j)
for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2.
Proof. There exists a desired vector b which constitutes
a Nash equilibrium if and only if the following set of 
inequalities can be satisfied (the variables are the πi and bj):
πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj) ∀i, ∀j < i (3)
πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj+1) ∀i, ∀j > i (4)
πi = γi(rσ(i) − bi+1) ∀i (5)
bi ≥ bi+1 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 (6)
πi ≥ 0, bi ≥ 0 ∀i
Here rσ(i) is the revenue of the agent allocated slot i, and
πi and bi may be interpreted as this agent"s surplus and
declared revenue, respectively. We first argue that 
constraints (6) can be removed, because the inequalities above
can be satisfied if and only if the inequalities without (6) can
be satisfied. The necessary direction is immediate. Assume
we have a vector (π, b) which satisfies all inequalities above
except (6). Then there is some i for which bi < bi+1. 
Construct a new vector (π, b ) identical to the original except
with bi+1 = bi. We now have bi = bi+1. An agent in slot
k < i sees the price of slot i decrease from bi+1 to bi+1 = bi,
but this does not make i more preferred than k to this agent
because we have πk ≥ γi−1(rσ(k) − bi) ≥ γi(rσ(k) − bi) =
γi(rσ(k) −bi+1) (i.e. because the agent in slot k did not 
originally prefer slot i − 1 at price bi, he will not prefer slot i
at price bi). A similar argument applies for agents in slots
k > i + 1. The agent in slot i sees the price of this slot
go down, which only makes it more preferred. Finally, the
agent in slot i + 1 sees no change in the price of any slot, so
his slot remains most preferred. Hence inequalities (3)-(5)
remain valid at (π, b ). We first make this change to the bi+1
where bi < bi+1 and index i is smallest. We then recursively
apply the change until we eventually obtain a vector that
satisfies all inequalities.
We safely ignore inequalities (6) from now on. By the
Farkas lemma, the remaining inequalities can be satisfied if
and only if there is no vector z such that
X
i,j
(γj rσ(i)) zσ(i)j > 0

X
j
zσ(i)j ≤ 0 ∀i (8)
zσ(i)j ≥ 0 ∀i, ∀j = i
zσ(i)i free ∀i
Note that a variable of the form zσ(i)i appears at most once
in a constraint of type (8), so such a variable can never be
positive. Also, zσ(i)1 = 0 for all i = 1 by constraint (7),
since such variables never appear with another of the form
zσ(i)i.
Now if we wish to raise zσ(i)j above 0 by one unit for j = i,
we must lower zσ(i)i by one unit because of the constraint
of type (8). Because γjrσ(i) ≤ γirσ(i) for i < j, raising
224
zσ(i)j with i < j while adjusting other variables to maintain
feasibility cannot make the objective
P
i,j(γjrσ(i))zσ(i)j 
positive. If this objective is positive, then this is due to some
component zσ(i)j with i > j being positive.
Now for the constraints of type (7), if i > j then zσ(i)j
appears with zσ(j−1)j−1 (for 1 < j < N). So to raise the
former variable γ−1
j units and maintain feasibility, we must
(I) lower zσ(i)i by γ−1
j units, and (II) lower zσ(j−1)j−1 by
γ−1
j−1 units. Hence if the following inequalities hold:
rσ(i) ≤
„

«
rσ(i) + rσ(j−1) (9)
for 2 ≤ j ≤ N − 1 and i > j, raising some zσ(i)j with
i > j cannot make the objective positive, and there is no
z that satisfies all inequalities above. Conversely, if some
inequality (9) does not hold, the objective can be made 
positive by raising the corresponding zσ(i)j and adjusting other
variables so that feasibility is just maintained. By a slight
reindexing, inequalities (9) yield the statement of the 
theorem.
The RBB case is entirely analogous.

xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j)
for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2.
Proof Sketch. The proof technique is the same as in the
previous lemma. The desired Nash equilibrium exists if and
only if a related set of inequalities can be satisfied; by the
Farkas lemma, this occurs if and only if an alternate set of
inequalities cannot be satisfied. The conditions that 
determine whether the latter holds are given in the statement of
the lemma.
The two lemmas above immediately lead to the following
result.
Theorem 3. There always exists a complete information
Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the second-price RBB
slot auction. There always exists an efficient complete 
information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the 
secondprice RBR slot auction.
Proof. First consider RBB. Suppose agents are ranked
according to their true values. Since xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for i > j,
the system of inequalities in Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the
allocation is the result of some Nash equilibrium bid profile.
By the same type of argument but appealing to Lemma 2
for RBR, there exists a Nash equilibrium bid profile such
that bidders are ranked according to their true revenues.
By Theorem 1, this latter allocation is efficient.
This theorem establishes existence but not uniqueness.
Indeed we expect that in many cases there will be multiple
allocations (and hence equilibria) which satisfy the 
conditions of Lemmas 2 and 3. In particular, not all equilibria of
a second-price RBR auction will be efficient. For instance,
according to Lemma 2, with two agents and two slots any
allocation can arise in a RBR equilibrium because no 
constraints apply.
Theorems 2 and 3 taken together provide a possible 
explanation for Yahoo!"s switch from first to second pricing.
We saw in Section 3.1 that this does not induce truthfulness
from bidders. With first pricing, there will always be some
bidder that feels compelled to adjust his bid. Second pricing
is more convenient because an equilibrium can be reached,
and this reduces the cost of bid management.
4.2 Efficiency
For a given allocation rule, we call the allocation that
would result if the bidders reported their values truthfully
the standard allocation. Hence in the standard RBB 
allocation bidders are ranked by true values, and in the standard
RBR allocation they are ranked by true revenues. 
According to Lemmas 2 and 3, a ranking that results from a Nash
equilibrium profile can only deviate from the standard 
allocation by having agents with relatively similar values or
revenues switch places. That is, if ri > rj then with RBR
agent j can be ranked higher than i only if the ratio rj/ri is
sufficiently large; similarly for RBB. This suggests that the
value of an equilibrium allocation cannot differ too much
from the value obtained in the standard allocation, and the
following theorems confirms this.
For an allocation σ of slots to agents, we denote its 
total value by f(σ) =
PN
i=1 γirσ(i). We denote by g(σ) =

(where by default γN+1 = 0). Let ηx and ηr be the standard

Theorem 4. For an allocation σ that results from a 
purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot 
auction, we have f(σ) ≥ Lf(ηr).
Proof. We number the agents so that agent i has the
ith

It may be the case that for some slot i, we have σ(i) > i
and for slots k > i + 1 we have σ(k) > i. We then say that
slot i is inverted. Let S be the set of agents with indices at
least i + 1; there are N − i of these. If slot i is inverted, it is
occupied by some agent from S. Also all slots strictly lower
than i + 1 must be occupied by the remaining agents from
S, since σ(k) > i for k ≥ i + 2. The agent in slot i + 1 must
then have an index σ(i + 1) ≤ i (note this means slot i + 1
cannot be inverted). Now there are two cases. In the first
case we have σ(i) = i + 1. Then

In the second case we have σ(i) > i+1. Then since all agents
in S except the one in slot i lie strictly below slot i + 1, and
225
the agent in slot i is not agent i + 1, it must be that agent
i+1 is in a slot strictly below slot i+1. This means that it is
at least two slots below the agent that actually occupies slot
i, and by Lemma 2 we then have rσ(i) ≥ ri+1

. With δ = 1.428 (see

pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot
auction is always within a factor of 3.34 of the efficient value
with such a discount.
Again for RBB we have an analogous result.
Theorem 5. For an allocation σ that results from a 
purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBB slot 
auction, we have g(σ) ≥ Lg(ηx).
Proof Sketch. Simply substitute bidder values for bidder
revenues in the proof of Theorem 4, and appeal to Lemma 3.
