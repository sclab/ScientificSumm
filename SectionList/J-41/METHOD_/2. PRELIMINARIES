We focus on a slot auction for a single keyword. In a
setting of incomplete information, a bidder knows only 
distributions over others" private information (value per click
and relevance). With complete information, a bidder knows
others" private information, and so does not need to rely on
distributions to strategize. We first describe the model for
the case with incomplete information, and drop the 
distributional information from the model when we come to the
complete-information case in Section 4.
2.1 The Model
There is a fixed number K of slots to be allocated among
N bidders. We assume without loss of generality that K ≤
N, since superfluous slots can remain blank. Bidder i assigns
a value of Xi to each click received on its advertisement,
regardless of this advertisement"s rank.9
The probability
that i"s advertisement will be clicked if viewed is Ai ∈ [0, 1].
We refer to Ai as bidder i"s relevance. We refer to Ri =
AiXi as bidder i"s revenue. The Xi, Ai, and Ri are random
9
Indeed Kitts et al. [10] find that in their sample of actual
click data, the correlation between rank and conversion rate
is not statistically significant. However, for the purposes
of our model it is also important that bidders believe that
conversion rate does not vary with rank.
variables and we denote their realizations by xi, αi, and ri
respectively. The probability that an advertisement will be
viewed if placed in slot j is γj ∈ [0, 1]. We assume γ1 >
γ2 > . . . > γK. Hence bidder i"s advertisement will have a
clickthrough rate of γjαi if placed in slot j. Of course, an
advertisement does not receive any clicks if it is not allocated
a slot.
Each bidder"s value and relevance pair (Xi, Ai) is 
independently and identically distributed on [0, ¯x] × [0, 1] according
to a continuous density function f that has full support on
its domain. The density f and slot probabilities γ1, . . . , γK
are common knowledge. Only bidder i knows the 
realization xi of its value per click Xi. Both bidder i and the seller
know the realization αi of Ai, but this realization remains
unobservable to the other bidders.
We assume that bidders have quasi-linear utility 
functions. That is, the expected utility to bidder i of obtaining
the slot of rank j at a price of b per click is
ui(j, b) = γjαi(xi − b)
If the advertising firms bidding in the slot auction are 
riskneutral and have ample liquidity, quasi-linearity is a 
reasonable assumption.
The assumptions of independence, symmetry, and 
riskneutrality made above are all quite standard in single-item
auction theory [11, 19]. The assumption that clickthrough
rate decays monotonically with lower slots-by the same
factors for each agent-is unique to the slot auction 
problem. We view it as a main contribution of our work to
show that this assumption allows for tractable analysis of
the slot auction problem using standard tools from 
singleitem auction theory. It also allows for interesting results in
the complete information case. A common model of 
decaying clickthrough rate is the exponential decay model, where
γk = 1
δk−1 with decay δ > 1. Feng et al. [7] state that
their actual clickthrough data is fitted extremely well by an
exponential decay model with δ = 1.428.
Our model lacks budget constraints, which are an 
important feature of real slot auctions. With budget constraints
keyword auctions cannot be considered independently of one
another, because the budget must be allocated across 
multiple keywords-a single advertiser typically bids on multiple
keywords relevant to his business. Introducing this element
into the model is an important next step for future work.10
2.2 Auction Formats
In a slot auction a bidder provides to the seller a declared
value per click ˜xi(xi, αi) which depends on his true value
and relevance. We often denote this declared value (bid)
by ˜xi for short. Since a bidder"s relevance αi is observable
to the seller, the bidder cannot misrepresent it. We denote
the kth
highest of the N declared values by ˜x(k)
, and the
kth
highest of the N declared revenues by ˜r(k)
, where the
declared revenue of bidder i is ˜ri = αi ˜xi. We consider two
types of allocation rules, rank by bid (RBB) and rank
by revenue (RBR):
10
Models with budget constraints have begun to appear in
this research area. Abrams [1] and Borgs et al. [3] design
multi-unit auctions for budget-constrained bidders, which
can be interpreted as slot auctions, with a focus on revenue
optimization and truthfulness. Mehta et al. [14] address
the problem of matching user queries to budget-constrained
advertisers so as to maximize revenue.

RBB. Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜xi = ˜x(k)
.
RBR. Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜ri = ˜r(k)
.
We will commonly represent an allocation by a one-to-one
function σ : [K] → [N], where [n] is the set of integers
{1, 2, . . . , n}. Hence slot k goes to bidder σ(k).
We also consider two different types of payment rules.
Note that no matter what the payment rule, a bidder that
is not allocated a slot will pay 0 since his listing cannot
receive any clicks.
First-price. The bidder allocated slot k, namely σ(k), pays
˜xσ(k) per click under both the RBB and RBR 
allocation rules.
Second-price. If k < N, bidder σ(k) pays ˜xσ(k+1) per click
under the RBB rule, and pays ˜rσ(k+1)/ασ(k) per click
under the RBR rule. If k = N, bidder σ(k) pays 0 per
click.11
Intuitively, a second-price payment rule sets a bidder"s 
payment to the lowest bid it could have declared while 
maintaining the same ranking, given the allocation rule used.
Overture introduced the first slot auction design in 1997,
using a first-price RBB scheme. Google then followed in
2000 with a second-price RBR scheme. In 2002, Overture
(at this point acquired by Yahoo!) then switched to second
pricing but still allocates using RBB. One possible reason
for the switch is given in Section 4.
We assume that ties are broken as follows in the event
that two agents make the exact same bid or declare the
same revenue. There is a permutation of the agents κ :
[N] → [N] that is fixed beforehand. If the bids of agents i
and j are tied, then agent i obtains a higher slot if and only
if κ(i) < κ(j). This is consistent with the practice in real
slot auctions where ties are broken by the bidders" order of
arrival.
