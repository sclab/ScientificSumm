This paper analyzed stylized versions of the slot auction
designs currently used by Yahoo! and Google, namely rank
by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), respectively.
We also considered first and second pricing rules together
with each of these allocation rules, since both have been used
historically. We first studied the short-run setting with
incomplete information, corresponding to the case where
agents have just approached the mechanism. Our 
equilibrium analysis revealed that RBB has much weaker 
informational requirements than RBR, because bidders need not
know any information about relevance (even their own) to
play the Bayes-Nash equilibrium. However, RBR leads to
an efficient allocation in equilibrium, whereas RBB does not.
We showed that for an arbitrary distribution over value and
relevance, no revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible.
We hope that the tools we used to establish these results
(revenue equivalence, the form of first-price equilibria, the
truthful payments rules) will help others wanting to pursue
further analyses of slot auctions.
We also studied the long-run case where agents have
experimented with their bids and each settled on one they
find optimal. We argued that a stable set of bids in this
setting can be modeled as a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium
of the static game of complete information. We showed that
no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either RBB or RBR
using first pricing, but that with second pricing there always
exists such an equilibrium (in the case of RBR, an efficient
equilibrium). In general second pricing allows for multiple
pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of
such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the
value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case
of RBR is the efficient value).
