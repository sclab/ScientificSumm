Today, Internet giants Google and Yahoo! boast a 
combined market capitalization of over $150 billion, largely on
the strength of sponsored search, the fastest growing 
component of a resurgent online advertising industry. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that 2004 industry-wide sponsored
search revenues were $3.9 billion, or 40% of total 
Internet advertising revenues.1
Industry watchers expect 2005
revenues to reach or exceed $7 billion.2
Roughly 80% of
Google"s estimated $4 billion in 2005 revenue and roughly
45% of Yahoo!"s estimated $3.7 billion in 2005 revenue will
likely be attributable to sponsored search.3
A number of
other companies-including LookSmart, FindWhat, 
InterActiveCorp (Ask Jeeves), and eBay (Shopping.com)-earn
hundreds of millions of dollars of sponsored search revenue
annually.
Sponsored search is a form of advertising where merchants
pay to appear alongside web search results. For example,
when a user searches for used honda accord san diego in
a web search engine, a variety of commercial entities (San
Diego car dealers, Honda Corp, automobile information 
portals, classified ad aggregators, eBay, etc...) may bid to to
have their listings featured alongside the standard 
algorithmic search listings. Advertisers bid for placement on the
page in an auction-style format where the higher they bid
the more likely their listing will appear above other ads on
the page. By convention, sponsored search advertisers 
generally pay per click, meaning that they pay only when a user
clicks on their ad, and do not pay if their ad is displayed but
not clicked. Though many people claim to systematically 
ignore sponsored search ads, Majestic Research reports that

These are rough back of the envelope estimates. Google
and Yahoo! 2005 revenue estimates were obtained from 
Yahoo! Finance. We assumed $7 billion in 2005 industry-wide
sponsored search revenues. We used Nielsen/NetRatings 
estimates of search engine market share in the US, the most
monetized market:

Using comScore"s international search engine market share
estimates would yield different estimates:

as many as 17% of Google searches result in a paid click, and
that Google earns roughly nine cents on average for every
search query they process.4
Usually, sponsored search results appear in a separate 
section of the page designated as sponsored above or to the
right of the algorithmic results. Sponsored search results
are displayed in a format similar to algorithmic results: as
a list of items each containing a title, a text description,
and a hyperlink to a corresponding web page. We call each
position in the list a slot. Generally, advertisements that
appear in a higher ranked slot (higher on the page) garner
more attention and more clicks from users. Thus, all else
being equal, merchants generally prefer higher ranked slots
to lower ranked slots.
Merchants bid for placement next to particular search
queries; for example, Orbitz and Travelocity may bid for
las vegas hotel while Dell and HP bid for laptop 
computer. As mentioned, bids are expressed as a maximum
willingness to pay per click. For example, a forty-cent bid
by HostRocket for web hosting means HostRocket is 
willing to pay up to forty cents every time a user clicks on their
ad.5
The auctioneer (the search engine6
) evaluates the bids
and allocates slots to advertisers. In principle, the 
allocation decision can be altered with each new incoming search
query, so in effect new auctions clear continuously over time
as search queries arrive.
Many allocation rules are plausible. In this paper, we 
investigate two allocation rules, roughly corresponding to the
two allocation rules used by Yahoo! and Google. The rank
by bid (RBB) allocation assigns slots in order of bids, with
higher ranked slots going to higher bidders. The rank by
revenue (RBR) allocation assigns slots in order of the 
product of bid times expected relevance, where relevance is the
proportion of users that click on the merchant"s ad after
viewing it. In our model, we assume that an ad"s expected
relevance is known to the auctioneer and the advertiser (but
not necessarily to other advertisers), and that clickthrough
rate decays monotonically with lower ranked slots. In 
practice, the expected clickthrough rate depends on a number
of factors, including the position on the page, the ad text
(which in turn depends on the identity of the bidder), the
nature and intent of the user, and the context of other ads
and algorithmic results on the page, and must be learned
over time by both the auctioneer and the bidder [13]. As of
this writing, to a rough first-order approximation, Yahoo!
employs a RBB allocation and Google employs a RBR 
allocation, though numerous caveats apply in both cases when
it comes to the vagaries of real-world implementations.7
Even when examining a one-shot version of a slot 
auction, the mechanism differs from a standard multi-item

Usually advertisers also set daily or monthly budget caps;
in this paper we do not model budget constraints.

In the sponsored search industry, the auctioneer and search
engine are not always the same entity. For example Google
runs the sponsored search ads for AOL web search, with
revenue being shared. Similarly, Yahoo! currently runs the
sponsored search ads for MSN web search, though Microsoft
will begin independent operations soon.

Here are two among many exceptions to the Yahoo! =
RBB and Google = RBR assertion: (1) Yahoo! excludes
ads deemed insufficiently relevant either by a human editor
or due to poor historical click rate; (2) Google sets differing
reserve prices depending on Google"s estimate of ad quality.
tion in subtle ways. First, a single bid per merchant is used
to allocate multiple non-identical slots. Second, the bid is
communicated not as a direct preference over slots, but as
a preference for clicks that depend stochastically on slot 
allocation.
We investigate a number of economic properties of RBB
and RBR slot auctions. We consider the short-run 
incomplete information case in Section 3, adapting and 
extending standard analyses of single-item auctions. In Section 4
we turn to the long-run complete information case; our
characterization results here draw on techniques from 
linear programming. Throughout, important observations are
highlighted as claims supported by examples. Our 
contributions are as follows:
• We show that with multiple slots, bidders do not reveal
their true values with either RBB or RBR, and with
either first- or second-pricing.
• With incomplete information, we find that the 
informational requirements of playing the equilibrium bid
are much weaker for RBB than for RBR, because 
bidders need not know any information about each others"
relevance (or even their own) with RBB.
• With incomplete information, we prove that RBR is
efficient but that RBB is not.
• We show via a simple example that no general revenue
ranking of RBB and RBR is possible.
• We prove that in a complete-information setting, 
firstprice slot auctions have no pure strategy Nash 
equilibrium, but that there always exists a pure-strategy
equilibrium with second pricing.
• We provide a constant-factor bound on the deviation
from efficiency that can occur in the equilibrium of a
second-price slot auction.
In Section 2 we specify our model of bidders and the 
various slot auction formats.
In Section 3.1 we study the incentive properties of each
format, asking in which cases agents would bid truthfully.
There is possible confusion here because the second-price
design for slot auctions is reminiscent of the Vickrey auction
for a single item; we note that for slot auctions the Vickrey
mechanism is in fact very different from the second-price
mechanism, and so they have different incentive properties.8
In Section 3.2 we derive the Bayes-Nash equilibrium bids
for the various auction formats. This is useful for the 
efficiency and revenue results in later sections. It should 
become clear in this section that slot auctions in our model
are a straightforward generalization of single-item auctions.
Sections 3.3 and 3.4 address questions of efficiency and 
revenue under incomplete information, respectively.
In Section 4.1 we determine whether pure-strategy 
equilibria exist for the various auction formats, under complete
information. In Section 4.2 we derive bounds on the 
deviation from efficiency in the pure-strategy equilibria of 
secondprice slot auctions.
Our approach is positive rather than normative. We aim
to clarify the incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of
two slot auction designs currently in use, under settings of

incomplete and complete information. We do not attempt
to derive the optimal mechanism for a slot auction.
Related work. Feng et al. [7] compare the revenue 
performance of various ranking mechanisms for slot auctions
in a model with incomplete information, much as we do in
Section 3.4, but they obtain their results via simulations
whereas we perform an equilibrium analysis.
Liu and Chen [12] study properties of slot auctions under
incomplete information. Their setting is essentially the same
as ours, except they restrict their attention to a model with
a single slot and a binary type for bidder relevance (high or
low). They find that RBR is efficient, but that no general
revenue ranking of RBB and RBR is possible, which agrees
with our results. They also take a design approach and
show how the auctioneer should assign relevance scores to
optimize its revenue.
Edelman et al. [6] model the slot auction problem both as
a static game of complete information and a dynamic game
of incomplete information. They study the locally 
envyfree equilibria of the static game of complete information;
this is a solution concept motivated by certain bidding 
behaviors that arise due to the presence of budget constraints.
They do not view slot auctions as static games of 
incomplete information as we do, but do study them as dynamic
games of incomplete information and derive results on the
uniqueness and revenue properties of the resulting 
equilibria. They also provide a nice description of the evolution of
the market for sponsored search.
Varian [18] also studies slot auctions under a setting of
complete information. He focuses on symmetric 
equilibria, which are a refinement of Nash equilibria appropriate for
slot auctions. He provides bounds on the revenue obtained
in equilibrium. He also gives bounds that can be used to
infer bidder values given their bids, and performs some 
empirical analysis using these results. In contrast, we focus
instead on efficiency and provide bounds on the deviation
from efficiency in complete-information equilibria.
