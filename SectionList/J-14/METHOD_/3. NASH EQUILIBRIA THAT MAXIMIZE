THE SOCIAL WELFARE: SOLUTIONS
IN R \ Q
From the point of view of social welfare, the best Nash 
equilibrium is the one that maximizes the sum of the players" expected
payoffs. Unfortunately, it turns out that computing such a strategy
profile exactly is not possible: in this section, we show that even if
all players" payoffs are integers, the strategy profile that maximizes
the total payoff may have irrational coordinates; moreover, it may
involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrary degree.
3.1 Warm-up: quadratic irrationalities
We start by providing an example of a graphical game on a path
of length 3 with integer payoffs such that in the Nash equilibrium
that maximizes the total payoff, one of the players has a strategy in
R \ Q. In the next subsection, we will extend this example to 
algebraic numbers of arbitrary degree n; to do so, we have to consider
paths of length O(n).
THEOREM 1. There exists an integer-payoff graphical game G
on a 3-vertex path UV W such that, in any Nash equilibrium of G
that maximizes social welfare, the strategy, u, of the player U and
the total payoff, p, satisfy u, p ∈ R \ Q.
PROOF. The payoffs to the players in G are specified as follows.
The payoff to U is identically 0, i.e., P0
(U) = P1
(U) = 0. Using
Claim 1, we select the payoffs to V so that P0
(V ) = −uw + 3w
and P1
(V ) = P0
(V ) + w(u + 2) − (u + 1), where u and w are
the (mixed) strategies of U and W , respectively. It follows that V
is indifferent between playing 0 and 1 if and only if w = f(u) =
u+1
u+2
. Observe that for any u ∈ [0, 1] we have f(u) ∈ [0, 1]. The
payoff to W is 0 if it selects the same action as V and 1 otherwise.
CLAIM 2. All Nash equilibria of the game G are of the form
(u, 1/2, f(u)). That is, in any Nash equilibrium, V plays v = 1/2
and W plays w = f(u). Moreover, for any value of u, the vector
of strategies (u, 1/2, f(u)) constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
PROOF. It is easy to check that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the vector
(u, 1/2, f(u)) is a Nash equilibrium. Indeed, U is content to play
164
any mixed strategy u no matter what V and W do. Furthermore,
V is indifferent between 0 and 1 as long as w = f(u), so it can
play 1/2. Finally, if V plays 0 and 1 with equal probability, W is
indifferent between 0 and 1, so it can play f(u).
Conversely, suppose that v > 1/2. Then W strictly prefers to
play 0, i.e., w = 0. Then for V we have P1
(V ) = P0
(V ) − (u +
1), i.e., P1
(V ) < P0
(V ), which implies v = 0, a contradiction.
Similarly, if v < 1/2, player W prefers to play 1, so we have
w = 1. Hence, P1
(V ) = P0
(V ) + (u + 2) − (u + 1), i.e.,
P1
(V ) > P0
(V ), which implies v = 1, a contradiction. Finally,
if v = 1/2, but w = f(u), player V is not indifferent between 0
and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2. This completes the
proof of Claim 2.
By Claim 2, the total payoff in any Nash equilibrium of this game
is a function of u. More specifically, the payoff to U is 0, the payoff
to V is −uf(u) + 3f(u), and the payoff to W is 1/2. Therefore,
the Nash equilibrium with the maximum total payoff corresponds
to the value of u that maximizes
g(u) = −u
(u + 1)
u + 2
+ 3
u + 1
u + 2
= −
(u − 3)(u + 1)
u + 2
.
To find extrema of g(u), we compute h(u) = − d
du
g(u). We have
h(u) =
(2u − 2)(u + 2) − (u − 3)(u + 1)
(u + 2)2
=
u2
+ 4u − 1
(u + 2)2
.
Hence, h(u) = 0 if and only if u ∈ {−2 +
√
5, −2 −
√
5}. Note
that −2 +
√
5 ∈ [0, 1].
The function g(u) changes sign at −2, −1, and 3. We have
g(u) < 0 for g > 3, g(u) > 0 for u < −2, so the extremum
of g(u) that lies between 1 and 3, i.e., u = −2 +
√
5, is a local
maximum. We conclude that the social welfare-maximizing Nash
equilibrium for this game is given by the vector of strategies (−2+√
5, 1/2, (5 −

5)/5). The respective total payoff is

This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.
3.2 Strategies of arbitrary degree
We have shown that in the social welfare-maximizing Nash 
equilibrium, some players" strategies can be quadratic irrationalities,
and so can the total payoff. In this subsection, we will extend this
result to show that we can construct an integer-payoff graphical
game on a path whose social welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium
involves arbitrary algebraic numbers in [0, 1].
THEOREM 2. For any degree-n algebraic number α ∈ [0, 1],
there exists an integer payoff graphical game on a path of length
O(n) such that, in all social welfare-maximizing Nash equilibria
of this game, one of the players plays α.
PROOF. Our proof consists of two steps. First, we construct a
rational expression R(x) and a segment [x , x ] such that x , x ∈
Q and α is the only maximum of R(x) on [x , x ]. Second, we
construct a graphical game whose Nash equilibria can be 
parameterized by u ∈ [x , x ], so that at the equilibrium that corresponds
to u the total payoff is R(u) and, moreover, some player"s 
strategy is u. It follows that to achieve the payoff-maximizing Nash
equilibrium, this player has to play α. The details follow.
LEMMA 1. Given an algebraic number α ∈ [0, 1], deg(α) =
n, there exist K2, . . . , K2n+2 ∈ Q and x , x ∈ (0, 1) ∩ Q such
that α is the only maximum of
R(x) =
K2
x + 2
+ · · · +
K2n+2
x + 2n + 2
on [x , x ].
PROOF. Let P(x) be the minimal polynomial of α, i.e., a 
polynomial of degree n with rational coefficients whose leading 
coefficient is 1 such that P(α) = 0. Let A = {α1, . . . , αn} be the set of
all roots of P(x). Consider the polynomial Q1(x) = −P2
(x). It
has the same roots as P(x), and moreover, for any x ∈ A we have
Q1(x) < 0. Hence, A is the set of all maxima of Q1(x). Now, set
R(x) = Q1(x)
(x+2)...(x+2n+1)(x+2n+2)
. Observe that R(x) ≤ 0 for all
x ∈ [0, 1] and R(x) = 0 if and only if Q1(x) = 0. Hence, the set
A is also the set of all maxima of R(x) on [0, 1].
Let d = min{|αi − α| | αi ∈ A, αi = α}, and set α =
max{α − d/2, 0}, α = min{α + d/2, 1}. Clearly, α is the
only zero (and hence, the only maximum) of R(x) on [α , α ].
Let x and x be some rational numbers in (α , α) and (α, α ),
respectively; note that by excluding the endpoints of the intervals
we ensure that x , x = 0, 1. As [x , x ] ⊂ [α , α ], we have that
α is the only maximum of R(x) on [x , x ].
As R(x) is a proper rational expression and all roots of its 
denominator are simple, by partial fraction decomposition theorem,
R(x) can be represented as
R(x) =
K2
x + 2
+ · · · +
K2n+2
x + 2n + 2
,
where K2, . . . , K2n+2 are rational numbers.
Consider a graphical game on the path
U−1V−1U0V0U1V1 . . . Uk−1Vk−1Uk,
where k = 2n + 2. Intuitively, we want each triple (Ui−1, Vi−1,
Ui) to behave similarly to the players U, V , and W from the game
described in the previous subsection. More precisely, we define the
payoffs to the players in the following way.
• The payoff to U−1 is 0 no matter what everyone else does.
• The expected payoff to V−1 is 0 if it plays 0 and u0 − (x −
x )u−1 −x if it plays 1, where u0 and u−1 are the strategies
of U0 and U−1, respectively.
• The expected payoff to V0 is 0 if it plays 0 and u1(u0 + 1)−
u0 if it plays 1, where u0 and u1 are the strategies of U0 and
U1, respectively.
• For each i = 1, . . . , k − 1, the expected payoff to Vi when
it plays 0 is P0
(Vi) = Aiuiui+1 − Aiui+1, and the 
expected payoff to Vi when it plays 1 is P1
(Vi) = P0
(Vi) +
ui+1(2 − ui) − 1, where Ai = −Ki+1 and ui+1 and ui are
the strategies of Ui+1 and Ui, respectively.
• For each i = 0, . . . , k, the payoff to Ui does not depend
on Vi and is 1 if Ui and Vi−1 select different actions and 0
otherwise.
We will now characterize the Nash equilibria of this game using a
sequence of claims.
CLAIM 3. In all Nash equilibria of this game V−1 plays 1/2,
and the strategies of u−1 and u0 satisfy u0 = (x − x )u−1 + x .
Consequently, in all Nash equilibria we have u0 ∈ [x , x ].
165
PROOF. The proof is similar to that of Claim 2. Let f(u−1) =
(x − x )u−1 + x . Clearly, the player V−1 is indifferent between
playing 0 and 1 if and only if u0 = f(u−1). Suppose that v−1 <
1/2. Then U0 strictly prefers to play 1, i.e., u0 = 1, so we have
P1
(V−1) = P0
(V−1) + 1 − (x − x )u−1 − x .
As
1 − x ≤ 1 − (x − x )u−1 − x ≤ 1 − x
for u−1 ∈ [0, 1] and x < 1, we have P1
(V−1) > P0
(V−1), so
V−1 prefers to play 1, a contradiction. Similarly, if v−1 > 1/2, the
player U0 strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., u0 = 0, so we have
P1
(V−1) = P0
(V−1) − (x − x )u−1 − x .
As x < x , x > 0, we have P1
(V−1) < P0
(V−1), so V−1
prefers to play 0, a contradiction. Finally, if V−1 plays 1/2, but
u0 = f(u−1), player V−1 is not indifferent between 0 and 1, so he
would deviate from playing 1/2.
Also, note that f(0) = x , f(1) = x , and, moreover, f(u−1) ∈
[x , x ] if and only if u−1 ∈ [0, 1]. Hence, in all Nash equilibria of
this game we have u0 ∈ [x , x ].
CLAIM 4. In all Nash equilibria of this game for each i =
0, . . . , k − 1, we have vi = 1/2, and the strategies of the 
players Ui and Ui+1 satisfy ui+1 = fi(ui), where f0(u) = u/(u + 1)
and fi(u) = 1/(2 − u) for i > 0.
PROOF. The proof of this claim is also similar to that of Claim 2.
We use induction on i to prove that the statement of the claim is true
and, additionally, ui = 1 for i > 0.
For the base case i = 0, note that u0 = 0 by the previous claim
(recall that x , x are selected so that x , x = 0, 1) and consider
the triple (U0, V0, U1). Let v0 be the strategy of V0. First, suppose
that v0 > 1/2. Then U1 strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., u1 = 0.
Then for V0 we have P1
(V0) = P0
(V0) − u0. As u0 = 0, we
have P1
(V0) < P0
(V0), which implies v1 = 0, a contradiction.
Similarly, if v0 < 1/2, player U1 prefers to play 1, so we have
u1 = 1. Hence, P1
(V0) = P0
(V0) + 1. It follows that P1
(V0) >
P0
(V0), which implies v0 = 1, a contradiction. Finally, if v0 =
1/2, but u1 = u0/(u0 + 1), player V0 is not indifferent between 0
and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2. Moreover, as u1 =
u0/(u0 + 1) and u0 ∈ [0, 1], we have u1 = 1.
The argument for the inductive step is similar. Namely, suppose
that the statement is proved for all i < i and consider the triple
(Ui, Vi, Ui+1).
Let vi be the strategy of Vi. First, suppose that vi > 1/2. Then
Ui+1 strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., ui+1 = 0. Then for Vi we
have P1
(Vi) = P0
(Vi)−1, i.e., P1
(Vi) < P0
(Vi), which implies
vi = 0, a contradiction. Similarly, if vi < 1/2, player Ui+1 prefers
to play 1, so we have ui+1 = 1. Hence, P1
(Vi) = P0
(Vi) +
1 − ui. By inductive hypothesis, we have ui < 1. Consequently,
P1
(Vi) > P0
(Vi), which implies vi = 1, a contradiction. Finally,
if vi = 1/2, but ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui), player Vi is not indifferent
between 0 and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2. Moreover,
as ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui) and ui < 1, we have ui+1 < 1.
CLAIM 5. Any strategy profile of the form
(u−1, 1/2, u0, 1/2, u1, 1/2, . . . , uk−1, 1/2, uk),
where u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x − x )u−1 + x , u1 = u0/(u0 + 1),
and ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui) for i ≥ 1 constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
PROOF. First, the player U−1"s payoffs do not depend on other
players" actions, so he is free to play any strategy in [0, 1]. As long
as u0 = (x −x )u−1 +x , player V−1 is indifferent between 0 and
1, so he is content to play 1/2; a similar argument applies to players
V0, . . . , Vk−1. Finally, for each i = 0, . . . , k, the payoffs of player
Ui only depend on the strategy of player Vi−1. In particular, as
long as vi−1 = 1/2, player Ui is indifferent between playing 0 and
1, so he can play any mixed strategy ui ∈ [0, 1]. To complete the
proof, note that (x − x )u−1 + x ∈ [0, 1] for all u−1 ∈ [0, 1],
u0/(u0 + 1) ∈ [0, 1] for all u0 ∈ [0, 1], and 1/(2 − ui) ∈ [0, 1]
for all ui ∈ [0, 1], so we have ui ∈ [0, 1] for all i = 0, . . . , k.
Now, let us compute the total payoff under a strategy profile of
the form given in Claim 5. The payoff to U−1 is 0, and the 
expected payoff to each of the Ui, i = 0, . . . , k, is 1/2. The expected
payoffs to V−1 and V0 are 0. Finally, for any i = 1, . . . , k − 1,
the expected payoff to Vi is Ti = Aiuiui+1 − Aiui+1. It 
follows that to find a Nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff,
we have to maximize
Pk−1
i=1 Ti subject to conditions u−1 ∈ [0, 1],
u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui)
for i = 1, . . . , k − 1.
We would like to express
Pk−1
i=1 Ti as a function of u0. To 
simplify notation, set u = u0.
LEMMA 2. For i = 1, . . . , k, we have ui = u+i−1
u+i
.
PROOF. The proof is by induction on i. For i = 1, we have
u1 = u/(u + 1). Now, for i ≥ 2 suppose that ui−1 = (u + i −
2)/(u + i − 1). We have ui = 1/(2 − ui−1) = (u + i − 1)/(2u +
2i − 2 − u − i + 2) = (u + i − 1)/(u + i).
It follows that for i = 1, . . . , k − 1 we have
Ti = Ai
u + i − 1
u + i
u + i
u + i + 1
− Ai
u + i
u + i + 1
=
−Ai
1
u + i + 1
=
Ki+1
u + i + 1
.
Observe that as u−1 varies from 0 to 1, u varies from x to x .
Therefore, to maximize the total payoff, we have to choose u ∈
[x , x ] so as to maximize
K2
u + 2
+ · · · +
Kk
u + k
= R(u).
By construction, the only maximum of R(u) on [x , x ] is α. It 
follows that in the payoff-maximizing Nash equilibrium of our game
U0 plays α.
Finally, note that the payoffs in our game are rational rather than
integer. However, it is easy to see that we can multiply all payoffs
to a player by their greatest common denominator without affecting
his strategy. In the resulting game, all payoffs are integer. This
concludes the proof of Theorem 2.
