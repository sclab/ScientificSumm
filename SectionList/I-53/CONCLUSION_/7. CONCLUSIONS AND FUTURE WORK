Coalition formation is an important form of interaction in 
multiagent systems. An important issue in such work is for the agents to
decide how to split the gains from cooperation between the 
members of a coalition. In this context, cooperative game theory offers
a solution concept called the Shapley value. The main advantage of
the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique
and fair. However, its main problem is that, for many coalition
games, the Shapley value cannot be determined in polynomial time.
In particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game
is #P-complete. Although this problem is, in general #P-complete,
we show that there are some specific voting games for which the
Shapley value can be determined in polynomial time and 
characterise such games. By doing so, we have shown when it is 
computationally feasible to find the exact Shapley value. For other complex
voting games, we presented a new randomized method for 
determining the approximate Shapley value. The time complexity of the
proposed method is linear in the number of players. We analysed
the performance of this method in terms of the percentage error in
the approximate Shapley value.
Our experiments show that the percentage error in the Shapley
value is at most 20. Furthermore, in most cases, the error is less
than 5%. Finally, we analyse the effect of the different parameters
of the voting game on this error. Our study shows that the error
decreases as
1. a player"s weight increases,
2. the quota increases, and
3. the number of players increases.
Given the fact that software agents have limited computational 
resources and therefore cannot compute the true Shapley value, our
results are especially relevant to such resource bounded agents. In
future, we will explore the problem of determining the Shapley
value for other commonly occurring coalition games like the 
production economy and the market economy.
