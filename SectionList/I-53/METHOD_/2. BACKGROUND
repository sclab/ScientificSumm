We begin by introducing coalition games and the Shapley value and
then define the weighted voting game. A coalition game is a game
where groups of players (coalitions) may enforce cooperative 
behaviour between their members. Hence the game is a competition
between coalitions of players, rather than between individual 
players.
Depending on how the players measure utility, coalition game
theory is split into two parts. If the players measure utility or the
payoff in the same units and there is a means of exchange of utility
such as side payments, we say the game has transferable utility;
otherwise it has non-transferable utility. More formally, a coalition
game with transferable utility, N, v , consists of:
1. a finite set (N = {1, 2, . . . , n}) of players and
2. a function (v) that associates with every non-empty subset S
of N (i.e., a coalition) a real number v(S) (the worth of S).
For each coalition S, the number v(S) is the total payoff that is
available for division among the members of S (i.e., the set of joint
actions that coalition S can take consists of all possible divisions
of v(S) among the members of S). Coalition games with 
nontransferable payoffs differ from ones with transferable payoffs in
the following way. For the former, each coalition is associated with
a set of payoff vectors that is not necessarily the set of all possible
divisions of some fixed amount. The focus of this paper is on the
weighted voting game (described in Section 2.1) which is a game
with transferable payoffs.
Thus, in either case, the players will only join a coalition if they
expect to gain from it. Here, the players are allowed to form 
binding agreements, and so there is strong incentive to work together to
receive the largest total payoff. The problem then is how to split the
total payoff between or among the players. In this context, Shapley
[19] constructed a solution using an axiomatic approach. Shapley
defined a value for games to be a function that assigns to a game
(N, v), a number ϕi(N, v) for each i in N. This function satisfies
three axioms [17]:
1. Symmetry. This axiom requires that the names of players
play no role in determining the value.
2. Carrier. This axiom requires that the sum of ϕi(N, v) for all
players i in any carrier C equal v(C). A carrier C is a subset
of N such that v(S) = v(S ∩ C) for any subset of players
S ⊂ N.
3. Additivity. This axiom specifies how the values of different
games must be related to one another. It requires that for
any games ϕi(N, v) and ϕi(N, v ), ϕi(N, v)+ϕi(N, v ) =
ϕi(N, v + v ) for all i in N.
Shapley showed that there is a unique function that satisfies these
three axioms.
Shapley viewed this value as an index for measuring the power
of players in a game. Like a price index or other market indices, the
value uses averages (or weighted averages in some of its 
generalizations) to aggregate the power of players in their various cooperation
opportunities. Alternatively, one can think of the Shapley value as
a measure of the utility of risk neutral players in a game.
We first introduce some notation and then define the Shapley
value. Let S denote the set N − {i} and fi : S → 2N−{i}
be
a random variable that takes its values in the set of all subsets of
N − {i}, and has the probability distribution function (g) defined
as:
g(fi(S) = S) =
|S|!(n − |S| − 1)!
n!
The random variable fi is interpreted as the random choice of a
coalition that player i joins. Then, a player"s Shapley value is 
defined in terms of its marginal contribution. Thus, the marginal 
contribution of player i to coalition S with i /∈ S is a function Δiv that
is defined as follows:
Δiv(S) = v(S ∪ {i}) − v(S)
Thus a player"s marginal contribution to a coalition S is the 
increase in the value of S as a result of i joining it.
DEFINITION 1. The Shapley value (ϕi) of the game N, v for
player i is the expectation (E) of its marginal contribution to a
coalition that is chosen randomly:
ϕi(N, v) = E[Δiv ◦ fi] (1)
The Shapley value is interpreted as follows. Suppose that all
the players are arranged in some order, all orderings being equally
likely. Then ϕi(N, v) is the expected marginal contribution, over
all orderings, of player i to the set of players who precede him.
The method for finding a player"s Shapley value depends on the
definition of the value function (v). This function is different for
different games, but here we focus specifically on the weighted 
voting game for the reasons outlined in Section 1.

2.1 The weighted voting game
We adopt the definition of the voting game given in [6]. Thus, there
is a set of n players that may, for example, represent shareholders
in a company or members in a parliament. The weighted voting
game is then a game G = N, v in which:
v(S) =
j
1 if w(S) ≥ q
0 otherwise
for some q ∈ IR+ and wi ∈ IRN
+ , where:
w(S) =
X
i∈S
wi
for any coalition S. Thus wi is the number of votes that player i
has and q is the number of votes needed to win the game (i.e., the
quota).
Note that for this game (denoted q; w1, . . . , wn ), a player"s
marginal contribution is either zero or one. This is because the
value of any coalition is either zero or one. A coalition with value
zero is called a losing coalition and with value one a winning
coalition. If a player"s entry to a coalition changes it from losing to
winning, then the player"s marginal contribution for that coalition
is one; otherwise it is zero.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it gives a 
solution that is both unique and fair. The property of uniqueness
is desirable because it leaves no ambiguity. The property of 
fairness relates to how the gains from cooperation are split between
the members of a coalition. In this case, a player"s Shapley value
is proportional to the contribution it makes as a member of a 
coalition; the more contribution it makes, the higher its value. Thus,
from a player"s perspective, both uniqueness and fairness are 
desirable properties.
