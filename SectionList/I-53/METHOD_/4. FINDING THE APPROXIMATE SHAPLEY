VALUE
We first give a brief introduction to randomized algorithms and
then present our randomized method for finding the approximate
Shapley value. Randomized algorithms are the most commonly
used approach for finding approximate solutions to 
computationally hard problems. A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that,
during some of its steps, performs random choices [2]. The 
random steps performed by the algorithm imply that by executing the
algorithm several times with the same input we are not guaranteed
to find the same solution. Now, since such algorithms generate 
approximate solutions, their performance is evaluated in terms of two
criteria: their time complexity, and their error of approximation.
The approximation error refers to the difference between the 
exact solution and its approximation. Against this background, we
present a randomized method for finding the approximate Shapley
value and empirically evaluate its error.
We first describe the general voting game and then present our
randomized algorithm. In its general form, a voting game has more
than two types of players. Let wi denote the weight of player
i. Thus, for m players and for quota q the game is of the form
q; w1, w2, . . . , wm . The weights are specified in terms of a 
probability distribution function. For such a game, we want to find the
approximate Shapley value.
We let P denote a population of players. The players" weights
in this population are defined by a probability distribution function.
Irrespective of the actual probability distribution function, let μ be
the mean weight for the population of players and ν the variance in
the players" weights. From this population of players we randomly
draw samples and find the sum of the players" weights in the sample
using the following rule from Sampling Theory (see [8] p425):
If w1, w2, . . . , wn is a random sample of size n drawn
from any distribution with mean μ and variance ν, then
the sample sum has an approximate Normal 
distribution with mean nμ and variance ν
n
(the larger the n the
better the approximation).

Table 1: Randomized algorithm to find the Shapley value for
player i.
We know from Definition 1, that the Shapley value for a player is
the expectation (E) of its marginal contribution to a coalition that is
chosen randomly. We use this rule to determine the Shapley value
as follows.
For player i with weight wi, let ϕi denote the Shapley value. Let
X denote the size of a random sample drawn from a population
in which the individual player weights have any distribution. The
marginal contribution of player i to this random sample is one if the
total weight of the X players in the sample is greater than or equal
to a = q −wi but less than b = q − (where is an inifinitesimally
small quantity). Otherwise, its marginal contribution is zero. Thus,
the expected marginal contribution of player i (denoted ΔX
i ) to the
sample coalition is the area under the curve defined by N(Xμ, ν
X
)
in the interval [a, b]. This area is shown as the region B in Figure 1
(the dotted line in the figure is Xμ). Hence we get:

The above steps are described in Table 1. In more detail, Step
1 does the initialization. In Step 2, we vary X between 1 and m
and repeatedly do the following. In Step 2.1, we randomly select a
sample SX of size X from the population P. Player i"s marginal
contribution to the random coalition SX is found in Step 2.2. The
average marginal contribution is found in Step 3 - and this is the
Shapley value for player i.
THEOREM 1. The time complexity of the proposed randomized
method is linear in the number of players.
PROOF. As per Equation 3, ΔX
i must be computed m times.
This is done in the for loop of Step 2 in Table 1. Hence, the time
complexity of computing a player"s Shapley value is O(m).
The following section analyses the approximation error for the 
proposed method.
