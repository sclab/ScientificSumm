Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends
to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide
area network of heterogeneous and autonomous 
administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet
does to the data sharing. There are several products that
support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a
few supports the execution of processes with interdependent
tasks.
In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a
programming model and a support infrastructure that 
allow the execution of structured processes in a widely 
distributed and hierarchical manner. This support 
infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive 
distribution of process elements over groups of available machines;
better resource use, due to its on demand creation of 
process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to
its structured nature; and localized communication among
strong dependent process elements, which are placed under
the same controller. These features contribute to better 
scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution
over the grid. Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling
algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic 
modification schemes.
The next work will be the implementation of a recovery
mechanism that uses the execution and data state of 
processes and controllers to recover process execution. After
that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to
forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to
foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this
information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a
better process execution performance. Finally, it is 
interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of 
processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term
processes to the continuously changing grid environment.
