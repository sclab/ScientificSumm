The support infrastructure comprises tools for 
specification, and services for execution and monitoring of 
structured processes in highly distributed, heterogeneous and 
autonomous grid environments. It has services to monitor
availability of resources in the grid, to interpret processes
and schedule activities and controllers, and to execute 
activities.
3.1 Infrastructure Architecture
The support infrastructure architecture is composed of
groups of machines and data repositories, which preserves
its administrative autonomy. Generally, localized machines
and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form
a group. Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides
a combination of the following grid support services: group
manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity 
manager (AM). This combination determines what kind of group
node it represents: a group server, a process server, or 
simply a worker (see Figure 2).
In a group there are one or more group managers, but
only one acts as primary and the others, as replicas. They
are responsible to maintain availability information of group
machines. Moreover, group managers maintain references to
data resources of the group. They use group repositories to
persist and recover the location of nodes and their 
availability.
To control process execution, there are one or more 
process coordinators per group. They are responsible to 
instantiate and execute processes and controllers, select resources,
and schedule and dispatch activities to workers. In order
to persist and recover process execution and data, and also
load process specification, they use group repositories.
Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity 
manager. It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted
machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to
inform the current availability of the associated machine to
group managers. They also have pendent activity queues,
containing activities to be executed.
3.2 Inter-group Relationships
In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure
must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like
Internet does. Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are

connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group
managers (see Figure 3).
Each group manager deals with requests of its group 
(represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local 
machines and maintain correspondent availability. 
Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of
other groups. Each group manager exports coarse 
availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and
also receives requests from other external services to 
furnish detailed availability information. In this way, if there
are resources available in external groups, it is possible to
send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in
order to execute them in external process coordinators and
activity managers, respectively.
