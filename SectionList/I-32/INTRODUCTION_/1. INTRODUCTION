Early research in multiagent systems (MAS) considered
cooperative groups of agents; because individual agents had
limited resources, or limited access to information (e.g., 
limited processing power, limited sensor coverage), they worked
together by design to solve problems that individually they
could not solve, or at least could not solve as efficiently.
MAS research, however, soon began to consider 
interacting agents with individuated interests, as representatives of
different humans or organizations with non-identical 
interests. When interactions are guided by diverse interests, 
participants may have to overcome disagreements, 
uncooperative interactions, and even intentional attempts to damage
one another. When these types of interactions occur, 
environments require appropriate behavior from the agents
situated in them. We call these environments Adversarial
Environments, and call the clashing agents Adversaries.
Models of cooperation and teamwork have been 
extensively explored in MAS through the axiomatization of 
mental states (e.g., [8, 4, 5]). However, none of this research
dealt with adversarial domains and their implications for
agent behavior. Our paper addresses this issue by 
providing a formal, axiomatized mental state model for a subset
of adversarial domains, namely simple zero-sum adversarial
environments.
Simple zero-sum encounters exist of course in various 
twoplayer games (e.g., Chess, Checkers), but they also exist in
n-player games (e.g., Risk, Diplomacy), auctions for a 
single good, and elsewhere. In these latter environments 
especially, using a utility-based adversarial search (such as the
Min-Max algorithm) does not always provide an adequate
solution; the payoff function might be quite complex or 
difficult to quantify, and there are natural computational 
limitations on bounded rational agents. In addition, traditional
search methods (like Min-Max) do not make use of a model
of the opponent, which has proven to be a valuable addition
to adversarial planning [9, 3, 11].
In this paper, we develop a formal, axiomatized model
for bounded rational agents that are situated in a zero-sum
adversarial environment. The model uses different modality
operators, and its main foundations are the SharedPlans [4]
model for collaborative behavior. We explore environment
properties and the mental states of agents to derive 
behavioral axioms; these behavioral axioms constitute a formal
model that serves as a specification and design guideline for
agent design in such settings.
We then investigate the behavior of our model empirically
using the Connect-Four board game. We show that this
game conforms to our environment definition, and analyze
players" behavior using a large set of completed match log

files. In addition, we use the results presented in [9] to 
discuss the importance of opponent modeling in our 
ConnectFour adversarial domain.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the
model"s formalization. Section 3 presents the empirical 
analysis and its results. We discuss related work in Section 4,
and conclude and present future directions in Section 5.
