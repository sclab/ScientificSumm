MECHANISMS
We are now ready to introduce the family of linear VCG
redistribution mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by
a vector of constants c0, c1, . . . , cn−1. The amount that the
mechanism returns to agent ai is zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 +
. . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn. That is, an agent
receives c0, plus c1 times the highest bid other than the
agent"s own bid, plus c2 times the second-highest other bid,
etc. The mechanism is strategy-proof, because for all i, zi
is independent of ˆvi. Also, the mechanism is anonymous.
It is helpful to see the entire list of redistribution 
payments:
z1 = c0 + c1ˆv2 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn
z2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn
z3 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn
z4 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn
. . .
zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn
. . .
zn−2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn
zn−1 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn
zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn−1

Not all choices of the constants c0, . . . , cn−1 produce a
mechanism that is individually rational, and not all choices
of the constants produce a mechanism that never incurs a
deficit. Hence, to obtain these properties, we need to place
some constraints on the constants.
To satisfy the individual rationality criterion, each agent"s
utility should always be non-negative. An agent that does
not win a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agent"s
redistribution payment. An agent that wins a unit obtains a
utility that is equal to the agent"s valuation for the unit, 
minus the VCG payment ˆvm+1, plus the agent"s redistribution
payment.
Consider agent an, the agent with the lowest bid. Since
this agent does not win an item (m < n), her utility is just
her redistribution payment zn. Hence, for the mechanism
to be individually rational, the ci must be such that zn is
always nonnegative. If the ci have this property, then it
actually follows that zi is nonnegative for every i, for the
following reason. Suppose there exists some i < n and some
vector of bids ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 such that zi < 0.
Then, consider the bid vector that results from replacing ˆvj
by ˆvj+1 for all j ≥ i, and letting ˆvn = 0. If we omit ˆvn
from this vector, the same vector results that results from
omitting ˆvi from the original vector. Therefore, an"s 
redistribution payment under the new vector should be the same as
ai"s redistribution payment under the old vector-but this
payment is negative.
If all redistribution payments are always nonnegative, then
the mechanism must be individually rational (because the
VCG mechanism is individually rational, and the 
redistribution payment only increases an agent"s utility). Therefore,
the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any
bid vector, zn ≥ 0.
To satisfy the non-deficit criterion, the sum of the 
redistribution payments should be less than or equal to the total
VCG payment. So for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥
0, the constants ci should make z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1.
We define the family of linear VCG redistribution 
mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms 
corresponding to constants ci that satisfy the above constraints
(so that the mechanisms will be individually rational and
have the no-deficit property). We now give two examples of
mechanisms in this family.
Example 1 (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism): Consider the
mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m
n
and ci = 0 for all
other i. Under this mechanism, each agent receives a 
redistribution payment of m
n
times the (m+1)th highest bid from
another agent. Hence, a1, . . . , am+1 receive a redistribution
payment of m
n
ˆvm+2, and the others receive m
n
ˆvm+1. Thus,
the total redistribution payment is (m+1)m
n
ˆvm+2 +(n−m−
1)m
n
ˆvm+1. This redistribution mechanism is individually 
rational, because all the redistribution payments are 
nonnegative, and never incurs a deficit, because (m + 1) m
n
ˆvm+2 +
(n−m−1)m
n
ˆvm+1 ≤ nm
n
ˆvm+1 = mˆvm+1. (We note that for
this mechanism to make sense, we need n ≥ m + 2.)
Example 2: Consider the mechanism corresponding to
cm+1 = m
n−m−1
, cm+2 = − m(m+1)
(n−m−1)(n−m−2)
, and ci = 0
for all other i. In this mechanism, each agent receives a
redistribution payment of m
n−m−1
times the (m + 1)th 
highest reported value from other agents, minus m(m+1)
(n−m−1)(n−m−2)
times the (m+2)th highest reported value from other agents.
Thus, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 −
m(m+1)(m+2)
(n−m−1)(n−m−2)
ˆvm+3. If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to
m
n−m−1
≥ m(m+1)
(n−m−1)(n−m−2)
), then each agent always receives
a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism
is individually rational. Also, the mechanism never incurs
a deficit, because the total VCG payment is mˆvm+1, which
is greater than the amount mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2)
(n−m−1)(n−m−2)
ˆvm+3
that is redistributed.
Which of these two mechanisms is better? Is there another
mechanism that is even better? This is what we study in
the next section.
