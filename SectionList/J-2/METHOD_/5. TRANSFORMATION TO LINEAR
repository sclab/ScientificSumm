PROGRAMMING
The optimization problem given in the previous section
can be rewritten as a linear program, based on the following
observations.
Claim 1. If c0, c1, . . . , cn−1 satisfy both the individual 
rationality and the non-deficit constraints, then ci = 0 for
i = 0, . . . , m.
Proof. First, let us prove that c0 = 0. Consider the
bid vector in which ˆvi = 0 for all i. To obtain individual
rationality, we must have c0 ≥ 0. To satisfy the non-deficit
constraint, we must have c0 ≤ 0. Thus we know c0 = 0.
Now, if ci = 0 for all i, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise,
let j = min{i|ci = 0}. Assume that j ≤ m. We recall that
we can write the individual rationality constraint as follows:
zn = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +c3ˆv3 +. . .+cn−2ˆvn−2 +cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0
for any bid vector. Let us consider the bid vector in which
ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for the rest. In this case zn = cj,
so we must have cj ≥ 0. The non-deficit constraint can
be written as follows: z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1 for any
bid vector. Consider the same bid vector as above. We have
zi = 0 for i ≤ j, because for these bids, the jth highest other
bid has value 0, so all the ci that are nonzero are multiplied
by 0. For i > j, we have zi = cj, because the jth highest
other bid has value 1, and all lower bids have value 0. So
the non-deficit constraint tells us that cj(n − j) ≤ mˆvm+1.
Because j ≤ m, ˆvm+1 = 0, so the right hand side is 0. We
also have n − j > 0 because j ≤ m < n. So cj ≤ 0. Because
we have already established that cj ≥ 0, it follows that
cj = 0; but this is contrary to assumption. So j > m.
Incidentally, this claim also shows that if m = n − 1,
then ci = 0 for all i. Thus, we are stuck with the VCG
mechanism. From here on, we only consider the case where
m < n − 1.
Claim 2. The individual rationality constraint can be 
written as follows:
Pj
i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1.
Before proving this claim, we introduce the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Given a positive integer k and a set of real
constants s1, s2, . . . , sk, (s1t1 + s2t2 + . . . + sktk ≥ 0 for any
t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥ tk ≥ 0) if and only if (
Pj
i=1 si ≥ 0 for
j = 1, 2, . . . , k).
Proof. Let di = ti −ti+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k−1, and dk =
tk. Then (s1t1 +s2t2 +. . .+sktk ≥ 0 for any t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥
tk ≥ 0) is equivalent to ((
P1
i=1 si)d1 + (
P2
i=1 si)d2 + . . . +
(
Pk
i=1 si)dk ≥ 0 for any set of arbitrary non-negative dj).
When
Pj
i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k, the above inequality
is obviously true. If for some j,
Pj
i=1 si < 0, if we set dj > 0
and di = 0 for all i = j, then the above inequality becomes
false. So
Pj
i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k is both necessary
and sufficient.
We are now ready to present the proof of Claim 2.
Proof. The individual rationality constraint can be 
written as zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 +
cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn−1 ≥
ˆvn ≥ 0. We have already shown that ci = 0 for i ≤ m.
Thus, the above can be simplified to zn = cm+1ˆvm+1 +
cm+2ˆvm+2+. . .+cn−2ˆvn−2+cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for any bid vector.
By the above lemma, this is equivalent to
Pj
i=m+1 ci ≥ 0
for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1.
Claim 3. The non-deficit constraint and the worst-case
constraint can also be written as linear inequalities involving
only the ci and k.
Proof. The non-deficit constraint requires that for any
bid vector, z1 +z2 +. . .+zn ≤ mˆvm+1, where zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 +
33
c2ˆv2 +. . .+ci−1ˆvi−1 +ciˆvi+1 +. . .+cn−1ˆvn for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Because ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to
qm+1ˆvm+1 + qm+2ˆvm+2 + . . . + qnˆvn ≥ 0
qm+1 = m − (n − m − 1)cm+1
qi = −(i−1)ci−1 −(n−i)ci, for i = m+2, . . . , n−1 (when
m + 2 > n − 1, this set of equalities is empty)
qn = −(n − 1)cn−1
By the above lemma, this is equivalent to
Pj
i=m+1 qi ≥ 0
for j = m + 1, . . . , n. So, we can simplify further as follows:
qm+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m
qm+1 + . . . + qm+i ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n
Pj=m+i−1
j=m+1 cj + (n − m −
i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1
qm+1 + . . . + qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n
Pj=n−1
j=m+1 cj ≤ m
So, the non-deficit constraint can be written as a set of
linear inequalities involving only the ci.
The worst-case constraint can be also written as a set of
linear inequalities, by the following reasoning. The 
worstcase constraint requires that for any bid input z1 +z2 +. . .+
zn ≥ kmˆvm+1, where zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +. . .+ci−1ˆvi−1 +
ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Because ci = 0 for
i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to
Qm+1ˆvm+1 + Qm+2ˆvm+2 + . . . + Qnˆvn ≥ 0
Qm+1 = (n − m − 1)cm+1 − km
Qi = (i − 1)ci−1 + (n − i)ci, for i = m + 2, . . . , n − 1
Qn = (n − 1)cn−1
By the above lemma, this is equivalent to
Pj
i=m+1 Qi ≥ 0
for j = m + 1, . . . , n. So, we can simplify further as follows:
Qm+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≥ km
Qm+1 + . . . + Qm+i ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n
Pj=m+i−1
j=m+1 cj + (n − m −
i)cm+i ≥ km for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1
Qm+1 + . . . + Qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n
Pj=n−1
j=m+1 cj ≥ km
So, the worst-case constraint can also be written as a set
of linear inequalities involving only the ci and k.
Combining all the claims, we see that the original 
optimization problem can be transformed into the following
linear program.

worst case)
