Many important problems in computer science and 
electronic commerce can be modeled as resource allocation 
problems. In such problems, we want to allocate the resources
(or items) to the agents that value them the most. 
Unfortunately, agents" valuations are private knowledge, and
self-interested agents will lie about their valuations if this
is to their benefit. One solution is to auction off the items,
possibly in a combinatorial auction where agents can bid
on bundles of items. There exist ways of determining the
payments that the agents make in such an auction that 
incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that
is, the payments make the auction strategy-proof. One very
general way of doing so is to use the VCG mechanism [23,
4, 12]. (The VCG mechanism is also known as the Clarke
mechanism or, in the specific context of auctions, the 
Generalized Vickrey Auction.)
Besides strategy-proofness, the VCG mechanism has 
several other nice properties in the context of resource 
allocation problems. It is efficient: the chosen allocation always
maximizes the sum of the agents" valuations. It is also 
(expost) individually rational: participating in the mechanism
never makes an agent worse off than not participating. 
Finally, it has a no-deficit property: the sum of the agents"
payments is always nonnegative.
In many settings, another property that would be 
desirable is (strong) budget balance, meaning that the payments
sum to exactly 0. Suppose the agents are trying to 
distribute some resources among themselves that do not have
a previous owner. For example, the agents may be trying
to allocate the right to use a shared good on a given day.
Or, the agents may be trying to allocate a resource that
they have collectively constructed, discovered, or otherwise
obtained. If the agents use an auction to allocate these 
resources, and the sum of the agents" payments in the auction
is positive, then this surplus payment must leave the system
30
of the agents (for example, the agents must give the money
to an outside party, or burn it). Na¨ıve redistribution of the
surplus payment (e.g. each of the n agents receives 1/n of
the surplus) will generally result in a mechanism that is not
strategy-proof (e.g. in a Vickrey auction, the second-highest
bidder would want to increase her bid to obtain a larger 
redistribution payment). Unfortunately, the VCG mechanism
is not budget balanced: typically, there is surplus payment.
Unfortunately, in general settings, it is in fact impossible to
design mechanisms that satisfy budget balance in addition
to the other desirable properties [16, 11, 21].
In light of this impossibility result, several authors have
obtained budget balance by sacrificing some of the other
desirable properties [2, 6, 22, 5]. Another approach that
is perhaps preferable is to use a mechanism that is more
budget balanced than the VCG mechanism, and maintains
all the other desirable properties. One way of trying to 
design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG
payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the
agents" incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained),
and that will maintain the other properties. In 2006, 
Cavallo [3] pursued exactly this idea, and designed a mechanism
that redistributes a large amount of the total VCG payment
while maintaining all of the other desirable properties of
the VCG mechanism. For example, in a single-item auction
(where the VCG mechanism coincides with the second-price
sealed-bid auction), the amount redistributed to bidder i
by Cavallo"s mechanism is 1/n times the second-highest bid
among bids other than i"s bid. The total redistributed is at
most the second-highest bid overall, and the redistribution
to agent i does not affect i"s incentives because it does not
depend on i"s own bid.
In this paper, we restrict our attention to a limited 
setting, and in this setting we extend Cavallo"s result. We
study allocation settings where there are multiple 
indistinguishable units of a single good, and all agents have unit
demand, i.e. they want only a single unit. For this specific
setting, Cavallo"s mechanism coincides with a mechanism
proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2]. Here we propose the family
of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms. All mechanisms
in this family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually 
rational, and never incur a deficit. The family includes the
Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case (with the caveat
that we only study allocation settings with multiple 
indistinguishable units of a single good and unit demand, while
Bailey"s and Cavallo"s mechanisms can be applied outside
these settings as well). We then provide an optimization
model for finding the optimal mechanism inside the family,
based on worst-case analysis. Both numerical and 
analytical solutions of this model are provided, and the resulting
mechanism shows significant improvement over the 
BaileyCavallo mechanism (in the worst case). For example, for
the problem of allocating a single unit, when the number
of agents is 10, our mechanism always redistributes more
than 98% of the total VCG payment back to the agents
(whereas the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism redistributes only
80% in the worst case). Finally, we prove that our 
mechanism is in fact optimal among all anonymous deterministic
mechanisms (even nonlinear ones) that satisfy the desirable
properties.
Around the same time, the same mechanism has been 
independently derived by Moulin [19].1
Moulin actually 
pursues a different objective (also based on worst-case analysis):
whereas our objective is to maximize the percentage of VCG
payments that are redistributed, Moulin tries to minimize
the overall payments from agents as a percentage of 
efficiency. It turns out that the resulting mechanisms are the
same. Towards the end of this paper, we consider dropping
the individual rationality requirement, and show that this
does not change the optimal mechanism for our objective.
For Moulin"s objective, dropping individual rationality does
change the optimal mechanism (but only if there are 
multiple units).
