THE FAMILY
In this section, we prove that the worst-case optimal 
redistribution mechanism among linear VCG redistribution
mechanisms is in fact optimal (in the worst case) among
all redistribution mechanisms that are deterministic, 
anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit
constraint. Thus, restricting our attention to linear VCG
redistribution mechanisms did not come at a loss.
To prove this theorem, we need the following lemma. This
lemma is not new: it was informally stated by Cavallo [3].
For completeness, we present it here with a detailed proof.
Lemma 2. A VCG redistribution mechanism is 
deterministic, anonymous and strategy-proof if and only if there exists
a function f : Rn−1
→ R, so that the redistribution payment
zi received by ai satisfies
zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn)
for all i and all bid vectors.
Proof. First, let us prove the only if direction, that is,
if a VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic, 
anonymous and strategy-proof then there exists a deterministic
function f : Rn−1
→ R, which makes
zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn)
for all i and all bid vectors.
If a VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic and
anonymous, then for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn, the
mechanism outputs a unique redistribution payment list:
z1, z2, . . . , zn. Let G : Rn
→ Rn
be the function that
maps ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn to z1, z2, . . . , zn for all bid vectors. Let
H(i, x1, x2, . . . , xn) be the ith element of G(x1, x2, . . . , xn),
so that zi = H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) for all bid vectors and all
1 ≤ i ≤ n. Because the mechanism is anonymous, two
agents should receive the same redistribution payment if
their bids are the same. So, if ˆvi = ˆvj, H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) =
H(j, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn). Hence, if we let j = min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi},
then H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = H(j, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn).
Let us define K : Rn
→ N × Rn
as follows: K(y, x1, x2,
. . . , xn−1) = [j, w1, w2, . . . , wn], where w1, w2, . . . , wn are
y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1 sorted in descending order, and
j = min{t|wt = y}. ({t|wt = y} = ∅ because y ∈ {w1, w2,
. . . , wn}). Also let us define F : Rn
→ R by
F(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn)
= H ◦ K(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn)
= H(min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi}, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn)
= H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = zi.
That is, F is the redistribution payment to an agent that
bids ˆvi when the other bids are ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn.
Since our mechanism is required to be strategy-proof, and
the space of valuations is unrestricted, zi should be 
independent of ˆvi by Lemma 1 in Cavallo [3]. Hence, we can simply
ignore the first variable input to F; let f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) =
F(0, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1). So, we have for all bid vectors and
i, zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn). This completes the
proof for the only if direction.
For the if direction, if the redistribution payment 
received by ai satisfies zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for
all bid vectors and i, then this is clearly a deterministic and
anonymous mechanism. To prove strategy-proofness, we 
observe that because an agent"s redistribution payment is not
affected by her own bid, her incentives are the same as in
the VCG mechanism, which is strategy-proof.
Now we are ready to introduce the next theorem:
Theorem 2. For any m and n with n ≥ m+2, the 
worstcase optimal mechanism among the family of linear VCG
redistribution mechanisms is worst-case optimal among all
mechanisms that are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof,
efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint.
While we needed individual rationality earlier in the 
paper, this theorem does not mention it, that is, we can not
find a mechanism with better worst-case performance even if
we sacrifice individual rationality. (The worst-case optimal
linear VCG redistribution mechanism is of course 
individually rational.)
Proof. Suppose there is a redistribution mechanism (when
the number of units is m and the number of agents is n) that
satisfies all of the above properties and has a better 
worstcase performance than the worst-case optimal linear VCG
redistribution mechanism, that is, its worst-case 
redistribution percentage ˆk is strictly greater than k∗
.
By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f :
Rn−1
→ R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for
all i and all bid vectors. We first prove that f has the
following properties.
Claim 5. f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 if the number of
1s is less than or equal to m.
Proof of claim. We assumed that for this mechanism,
the worst-case redistribution percentage satisfies ˆk > k∗
≥
0. If the total VCG payment is x, the total redistribution
payment should be in [ˆkx, x] (non-deficit criterion). 
Consider the case where all agents bid 0, so that the total VCG
payment is also 0. Hence, the total redistribution payment
should be in [ˆk · 0, 0]-that is, it should be 0. Hence every
agent"s redistribution payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0) must be 0.
Now, let ti = f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) where the number
of 1s equals i. We proved t0 = 0. If tn−1 = 0, consider the
bid vector where everyone bids 1. The total VCG payment is
m and the total redistribution payment is nf(1, 1, . . . , 1) =
ntn−1 = 0. This corresponds to 0% redistribution, which is
contrary to our assumption that ˆk > k∗
≥ 0. Now, consider
j = min{i|ti = 0} (which is well-defined because tn−1 = 0).
If j > m, the property is satisfied. If j ≤ m, consider
the bid vector where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all
other i. Under this bid vector, the first j agents each get
redistribution payment tj−1 = 0, and the remaining n − j
agents each get tj. Thus, the total redistribution payment
is (n − j)tj. Because the total VCG payment for this bid
vector is 0, we must have (n − j)tj = 0. So tj = 0 (j ≤
m < n). But this is contrary to the definition of j. Hence
f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than
or equal to m.
Claim 6. f satisfies the following inequalities:
ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m
ˆkm ≤ (m + i)tm+i−1 + (n − m − i)tm+i ≤ m for
i = 2, 3, . . . , n − m − 1
ˆkm ≤ ntn−1 ≤ m
Here ti is defined as in the proof of Claim 5.
37
Proof of claim. For j = m + 1, . . . , n, consider the bid
vectors where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
These bid vectors together with the non-deficit constraint
and worst-case constraint produce the above set of 
inequalities: for example, when j = m + 1, we consider the bid
vector ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ m + 1 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
The first m+1 agents each receive a redistribution payment
of tm = 0, and all other agents each receive tm+1. Thus,
the total VCG redistribution is (n − m − 1)tm+1. The 
nondeficit constraint gives (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m (because the
total VCG payment is m). The worst-case constraint gives
(n − m − 1)tm+1 ≥ ˆkm. Combining these two, we get the
first inequality. The other inequalities can be obtained in
the same way.
We now observe that the inequalities in Claim 6, together
with ˆk ≥ k∗
, are the same as those in Claim 4 (where the ti
are replaced by the ˆxi). Thus, we can conclude that ˆk = k∗
,
which is contrary to our assumption ˆk > k∗
. Hence no 
mechanism satisfying all the listed properties has a redistribution
percentage greater than k∗
in the worst case.
So far we have only talked about the case where n ≥ m+2.
For the purpose of completeness, we provide the following
claim for the n = m + 1 case.
Claim 7. For any m and n with n = m + 1, the original
VCG mechanism (that is, redistributing nothing) is (uniquely)
worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that
are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and
satisfy the non-deficit constraint.
We recall that when n = m+1, Claim 1 tells us that the only
mechanism inside the family of linear redistribution 
mechanisms is the original VCG mechanism, so that this 
mechanism is automatically worst-case optimal inside this family.
However, to prove the above claim, we need to show that it
is worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms
that have the desired properties.
Proof. Suppose a redistribution mechanism exists that
satisfies all of the above properties and has a worst-case
performance as good as the original VCG mechanism, that
is, its worst-case redistribution percentage is greater than
or equal to 0. This implies that the total redistribution
payment of this mechanism is always nonnegative.
By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f :
Rn−1
→ R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for
all i and all bid vectors. We will prove that f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1)
= 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0.
First, consider the bid vector where ˆvi = 0 for all i. Here,
each agent receives a redistribution payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0).
The total redistribution payment is then nf(0, 0, . . . , 0), which
should be both greater than or equal to 0 (by the above
observation) as well less than or equal to 0 (using the 
nondeficit criterion and the fact that the total VCG payment is
0). It follows that f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0. Now, let us consider
the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
For this bid vector, the agent with the highest bid receives
a redistribution payment of f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0, and the other
n − 1 agents each receive f(x1, 0, . . . , 0). By the same 
reasoning as above, the total redistribution payment should be
both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0,
hence f(x1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ 0.
Proceeding by induction, let us assume f(x1, x2, . . . , xk,
0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ 0, for some
k < n − 1. Consider the bid vector where ˆvi = xi for
i ≤ k + 1, and ˆvi = 0 for all other i, where the xi are 
arbitrary numbers satisfying x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0.
For the agents with the highest k + 1 bids, their 
redistribution payment is specified by f acting on an input with
only k non-zero variables. Hence they all receive 0 by 
induction assumption. The other n − k − 1 agents each 
receive f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0). The total 
redistribution payment is then (n−k−1)f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0),
which should be both greater than or equal to 0, and less
than or equal to the total VCG payment. Now, in this bid
vector, the lowest bid is 0 because k + 1 < n. But since
n = m + 1, the total VCG payment is mˆvn = 0. So
we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥
x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. By induction, this 
statement holds for all k < n − 1; when k + 1 = n − 1, we
have f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−2, xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥
xn−2 ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0. Hence, in this mechanism, the 
redistribution payment is always 0; that is, the mechanism is just
the original VCG mechanism.
Incidentally, we obtain the following corollary:
Corollary 2. No VCG redistribution mechanism 
satisfies all of the following: determinism, anonymity, 
strategyproofness, efficiency, and (strong) budget balance. This holds
for any n ≥ m + 1.
Proof. For the case n ≥ m + 2: If such a mechanism
exists, its worst-case performance would be better than that
of the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution 
mechanism, which by Theorem 1 obtains a redistribution 
percentage strictly less than 1. But Theorem 2 shows that it is
impossible to outperform this mechanism in the worst case.
For the case n = m + 1: If such a mechanism exists,
it would perform as well as the original VCG mechanism
in the worst case, which implies that it is identical to the
VCG mechanism by Claim 7. But the VCG mechanism is
not (strongly) budget balanced.
