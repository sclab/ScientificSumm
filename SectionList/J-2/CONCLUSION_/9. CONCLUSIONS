For allocation problems with one or more items, the 
wellknown Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is efficient,
strategy-proof, individually rational, and does not incur a
deficit. However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly)
budget balanced: generally, the agents" payments will sum
to more than 0. If there is an auctioneer who is selling
the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus 
payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer. However, if
the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely
interested in allocating the items efficiently among 
themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will
have to flow out of the system of agents. In 2006, 
Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of
the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining 
efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the
non-deficit property. In this paper, we extended this 
result in a restricted setting. We studied allocation settings
where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a 
single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific
setting, Cavallo"s mechanism coincides with a mechanism
proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].) Here we proposed a family
of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment
38
back to the agents. All mechanisms in the family are 
efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur
a deficit. The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism
as a special case. We then provided an optimization model
for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism
that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the
family, and showed how to cast this model as a linear 
program. We gave both numerical and analytical solutions
of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting 
mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo
mechanism (in the worst case). Finally, we proved that the
obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous 
deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties.
One important direction for future research is to try to
extend these results beyond multi-unit auctions with unit
demand. However, it turns out that in sufficiently general
settings, the worst-case optimal redistribution percentage
is 0. In such settings, the worst-case criterion provides no
guidance in determining a good redistribution mechanism
(even redistributing nothing achieves the optimal worst-case
percentage), so it becomes necessary to pursue other criteria.
Alternatively, one can try to identify other special settings
in which positive redistribution in the worst case is possible.
Another direction for future research is to consider whether
this mechanism has applications to collusion. For example,
in a typical collusive scheme, there is a bidding ring 
consisting of a number of colluders, who submit only a single
bid [10, 17]. If this bid wins, the colluders must allocate the
item amongst themselves, perhaps using payments-but of
course they do not want payments to flow out of the ring.
This work is part of a growing literature on designing
mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case. 
Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on 
designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such
as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that
are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the
agents" preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the
Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).
Some more recent papers have focused on designing 
mechanisms for profit maximization using worst-case competitive
analysis (e.g. [9, 1, 15, 8]). There has also been growing
interest in the design of online mechanisms [7] where the
agents arrive over time and decisions must be taken before
all the agents have arrived. Such work often also takes a
worst-case competitive analysis approach [14, 13]. It does
not appear that there are direct connections between our
work and these other works that focus on designing 
mechanisms that perform well in the worst case. Nevertheless,
it seems likely that future research will continue to 
investigate mechanism design for the worst case, and hopefully a
coherent framework will emerge.
