In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often 
analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their
strategies simultaneously. This requires some equilibrium
notion (Nash equilibrium and its refinements), and often
leads to the equilibrium selection problem: it is unclear to
each individual player according to which equilibrium she
should play. However, this model is not always realistic. In
many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy
before the other player makes a decision. For example, one
agent may arrive at the (real or virtual) site of the game
before the other, or, in the specific case of software agents,
the code for one agent may be completed and committed 
before that of another agent. Such models are synonymously
referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg 
models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly
different from optimal play in the model where strategies
are selected simultaneously. Specifically, if commitment to
mixed strategies is possible, then (optimal) commitment
never hurts the leader, and often helps.
The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic
solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the 
exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the 
designer is implicitly in a leadership position). In this paper,
we studied how to compute optimal strategies to commit
to under both commitment to pure strategies and 
commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian
games. For normal-form games, we showed that the optimal
pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any
number of players. An optimal mixed strategy to commit
to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two
players using linear programming (and no more efficiently
than that, in the sense that any linear program with a 
probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem). (This
is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of
minimax strategies in normal-form games.) The problem
becomes NP-hard for three (or more) players. In Bayesian
games, the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to
commit to is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the
follower has only a single type, although two-player games
in which the leader has only a single type can be solved
efficiently. The problem of finding an optimal mixed 
strategy to commit to in a Bayesian game is NP-hard even in
two-player games in which the leader has only a single type,
although two-player games in which the follower has only a
single type can be solved efficiently using a generalization
of the linear progamming approach for normal-form games.
The following two tables summarize these results.

Future research can take a number of directions. First,
we can empirically evaluate the techniques presented here on
test suites such as GAMUT [19]. We can also study the 
computation of optimal strategies to commit to in other1

concise representations of normal-form games-for example, in
graphical games [10] or local-effect/action graph games [14,
1]. For the cases where computing an optimal strategy to
commit to is NP-hard, we can also study the computation
of approximately optimal strategies to commit to. While the
correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in
this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a 
strategy that, if the following players play optimally, performs
almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this
definition becomes problematic when we consider that the
other players may also be playing only approximately 
optimally. One may also study models in which multiple (but
not all) players commit at the same time.
Another interesting direction to pursue is to see if 
computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to can help us
in, or otherwise shed light on, computing Nash equilibria.
Often, optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also Nash
equilibrium strategies (for example, in two-player zero-sum
games this is always true), although this is not always the
case (for example, as we already pointed out, sometimes the
optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated 
strategy, which can never be a Nash equilibrium strategy).
