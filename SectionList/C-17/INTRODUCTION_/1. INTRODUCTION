Today's Internet uses the IP protocol suite that was primarily
designed for the transport of data and provides best effort data
delivery. Delay-constraints and characteristics separate traditional
data on the one hand from voice & video applications on the
other. Hence, as progressively time-sensitive voice and video
applications are deployed on the Internet, the inadequacy of the
Internet is exposed. Further, we seek to port telephone services
on the Internet. Among them, virtual conference (teleconference)
facility is at the cutting edge. Audio and video conferencing on
Internet are popular [25] for the several advantages they inhere
[3,6]. Clearly, the bandwidth required for a teleconference over
the Internet increases rapidly with the number of participants;
reducing bandwidth without compromising audio quality is a
challenge in Internet Telephony. Additional critical issues are:
(a) packet delay, (b) echo, (c) mixing of audio from selected
clients, (d) automatic selection of clients to participate in the
conference, (e) playout of mixed audio for every client, (f)
handling clients not capable of mixing audio streams (such clients
are known as dumb clients), and (g) deciding the number of
simultaneously active clients in the conference without
compromising voice quality.
While all the above requirements are from the technology point of
view, the user's perspective and interactions are also essential
factors. There is plenty of discussion amongst HCI and CSCW
community on the use of Ethnomethodology for design of CSCW
applications. The basic approach is to provide larger bandwidth,
more facilities and more advanced control mechanisms, looking
forward to better quality of interaction. This approach ignores the
functional utility of the environment that is used for collaboration.
Eckehard Doerry [4] criticizes this approach by saying "it is
keeping form before function". Thus, the need is to take an
approach that considers both aspects - the technical and the
functional. Regarding the functional aspect, we refer to [15]
where it has been dealt with in some detail.
In this work, we do not discuss video conferencing; its inclusion
does not significantly benefit conference quality [4]. Our focus is
on virtual audio environments.
We first outline the challenges encountered in virtual audio
conferences. Then we look into the motivations followed by
relevant literature. In Section 5, we explain the architecture of our
system. Section 6 comprises description of the various algorithms
used in our setup. We address deployment issues. A discussion on
