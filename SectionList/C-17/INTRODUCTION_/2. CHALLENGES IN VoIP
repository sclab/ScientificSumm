CONFERENCING
Many challenges arise in building a VoIP application. The
following are of particular concern in the process:
• Ease of use: Conferencing must be simple; users need no
domain expertise. Management (addition/removal) of clients
and servers must be uncomplicated. Application
development should not presuppose specific characteristics
of the underlying system or of network layers. Ease of use
may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible
and economically viable technologies.
• Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under
heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.
Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total
number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion. So a
means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this
kind of real-time applications.
• Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs),
we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that
mimics a "real" conference, where more vocal participants
invite attention. Turn-taking in floor occupation by
participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of
natural transition.
• Standardization: The solution must conform to established
standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.
The above requirements are placed in the perspective of
observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and
will steer the VCE design.
