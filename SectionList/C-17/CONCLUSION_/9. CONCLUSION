In this paper, we have presented a discussion on a voice-only
virtual conferencing environment. We have argued that the
distributed nature of deployment here makes it scalable.
Interactivity is achieved by adapting a recent stream selection
scheme based on Loudness Number. Additionally, we incorporate
a result from a more recent work [15] where the sufficiency of
three simultaneous speakers has been demonstrated. Thus, there is
significantly effective utilization of bandwidth. A mixed stream is
played out at each client; each client may choose to have a
customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each
client. These render impromptu speech in a virtual teleconference
over VoIP a reality, as in a real face-to-face conference.
Compatibility is assured thanks to the use of SIP, the most 
soughtafter signaling protocol. To ensure a satisfying performance, we
do not demand the availability of multicast, but use it if and when
available. The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by
the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using
heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of
clients in the conference. This is due to the use of a Conference
Server local to each domain. VAD techniques help further traffic
reduction. Using SIP standard for signaling makes this solution
highly interoperable.
We have implemented a CS application on a campus-wide
network. We believe this new generation of virtual conferencing
environments will gain more popularity in the future as their ease
of deployment is assured thanks to readily available technologies
and scalable frameworks.
