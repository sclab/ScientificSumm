The bidding language was defined to allow for perfect 
symmetry between buyers and sellers and provide expressiveness
in an exchange domain, for instance for mixed bidders 
interested in executing trades such as swaps. This proved
especially challenging. The breakthrough came when we 
focused on changes in value for trades rather than providing
absolute values for allocations. For simplicity, we require the
same tree structure for both the upper and lower valuations.

Code size is measured in physical source line of code
(SLOC), as generated using David A. Wheeler"s SLOC
Count. The total of 6502 includes 184 for instrumentation
(not shown in the table). The JOpt solver interface is 
another 1964 lines, and Castor automatically generates around
5200 lines of code for XML file manipulation.

This allows the language itself to ensure consistency (with
the upper value at least the lower value on all trades) and
enforce monotonic tightening of these bounds for all trades
across rounds. It also provides for an efficient method to
check the RP activity rule, because it makes it simple to
reason about shared uncertainty between trades.
The decision to adopt a direct and proxied approach
in which bidders express their upper and lower values to a
trusted proxy agent that interacts with the exchange was
made early in the design process. In many ways this is
the clearest and most immediate way to generalize the 
design in Parkes et al. [24] and make it iterative. In addition,
this removes much opportunity for strategic manipulation:
bidders are restricted to making (incremental) statements
about their valuations. Another advantage is that it makes
the activity rule easy to explain: bidders can always meet
the activity rule by tightening bounds such that their true
value remains in the support.12
Perhaps most importantly,
having explicit information on upper and lower values 
permits progress in early rounds, even while there is no efficient
trade at pessimistic values.
Upper and lower bound information also provides 
guidance about when to terminate. Note that taken by itself,
PP = PO does not imply that the current provisional trade
is efficient with respect to all values consistent with current
value information. The difference in values between 
different trades, aggregated across all bidders, could be similar at
lower and upper bounds but quite different at intermediate
values (including truth). Nevertheless, we conjecture that
PP = PO will prove an excellent indicator of efficiency in
practical settings where the shape of the upper and lower
valuations does convey useful information. This is worthy of
experimental investigation. Moreover, the use of price and
RP activity provides additional guarantees.
We adopted linear prices (prices on individual items) rather
than non-linear prices (with prices on a trade not equal to
the sum of the prices on the component items) early in the
design process. The conciseness of this price representation
is very important for computational tractability within the
exchange and also to promote simplicity and transparency
for bidders. The RP activity rule was adopted later, and is
a good choice because of its excellent theoretical properties
when coupled with CE prices. The following can be easily
established: given exact CE prices pt−1
for provisional trade

This is in contrast to indirect price-based approaches, such
as clock-proxy [1], in which bidders must be able to reason
about the RP-constraints implied by bids in each round.

λt−1
at valuations vα
, then if the upper and lower values at
the start of round t already satisfy the RP rule (and without
the need for any tie-breaking), the provisional trade is 
efficient for all valuations consistent with the current bid trees.
When linear CE prices exist, this provides for a soundness
and completeness statement: if PP = PO, linear CE prices
exist, and the RP rule is satisfied, the provisional trade is
efficient (soundness); if prices are exact CE prices for the
provisional trade at vα
, but the trade is inefficient with 
respect to some valuation profile consistent with the current
bid trees, then at least one bidder must fail RP with her
current bid tree and progress will be made (completeness).
Future work must study convergence experimentally, and
extend this theory to allow for approximate prices.
Some strategic aspects of our ICE design deserve 
comment, and further study. First, we do not claim that 
truthfully responding to the RP rule is an ex post equilibrium.13
However, the exchange is designed to mimic the Threshold
rule in its payment scheme, which is known to have 
useful incentive properties [16]. We must be careful, though.
For instance we do not suggest to provide αeff
to bidders,
because as αeff
approaches 1 it would inform bidders that
bid values are becoming irrelevant to determining the trade
but merely used to determine payments (and bidders would
become increasingly reluctant to increase their lower 
valuations). Also, no consideration has been given in this work
to collusion by bidders. This is an issue that deserves some
attention in future work.
