The efficient, safe and reliable management of air traffic
flow is a complex problem, requiring solutions that integrate
control policies with time horizons ranging from minutes
up to a year. The main contribution of this paper is to
present a distributed adaptive air traffic flow management
algorithm that can be readily implemented and to test that
algorithm using FACET, a simulation tool widely used by
the FAA, NASA and the industry. Our method is based on
agents representing fixes and having each agent determine
the separation between aircraft approaching its fix. It offers
the significant benefit of not requiring radical changes to
the current air flow management structure and is therefore
readily deployable. The agents use reinforcement learning to
learn control policies and we explore different agent reward
functions and different ways of estimating those functions.
We are currently extending this work in three directions.
First, we are exploring new methods of estimating agent 
rewards, to further speed up the simulations. Second we are
investigating deployment strategies and looking for 
modifications that would have larger impact. One such 
modification is to extend the definition of agents from fixes to
sectors, giving agents more opportunity to control the 
traffic flow, and allow them to be more efficient in eliminating
congestion. Finally, in cooperation with domain experts,
we are investigating different system evaluation functions,
above and beyond the delay and congestion dependent G
presented in this paper.
