With over 40,000 flights operating within the United States
airspace on an average day, the management of traffic flow
is a complex and demanding problem. Not only are there
concerns for the efficiency of the system, but also for 
fairness (e.g., different airlines), adaptability (e.g., developing
weather patterns), reliability and safety (e.g., airport 
management). In order to address such issues, the management
of this traffic flow occurs over four hierarchical levels:
1. Separation assurance (2-30 minute decisions);
1
We discuss how flight plans with few fixes can be handled
in more detail in Section 2.
2. Regional flow (20 minutes to 2 hours);
3. National flow (1-8 hours); and
4. Dynamic airspace configuration (6 hours to 1 year).
Because of the strict guidelines and safety concerns 
surrounding aircraft separation, we will not address that control
level in this paper. Similarly, because of the business and
political impact of dynamic airspace configuration, we will
not address the outermost flow control level either. Instead,
we will focus on the regional and national flow management
problems, restricting our impact to decisions with time 
horizons between twenty minutes and eight hours. The proposed
algorithm will fit between long term planning by the FAA
and the very short term decisions by air traffic controllers.
The continental US airspace consists of 20 regional centers
(handling 200-300 flights on a given day) and 830 sectors
(handling 10-40 flights). The flow control problem has to
address the integration of policies across these sectors and
centers, account for the complexity of the system (e.g., over
5200 public use airports and 16,000 air traffic controllers)
and handle changes to the policies caused by weather 
patterns. Two of the fundamental problems in addressing the
flow problem are: (i) modeling and simulating such a large
complex system as the fidelity required to provide reliable 
results is difficult to achieve; and (ii) establishing the method
by which the flow management is evaluated, as directly 
minimizing the total delay may lead to inequities towards 
particular regions or commercial entities. Below, we discuss
how we addressed both issues, namely, we present FACET
a widely used simulation tool and discuss our system 
evaluation function.

routes and air flow statistics.
2.1 FACET
FACET (Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool), a physics
based model of the US airspace was developed to accurately
model the complex air traffic flow problem [4]. It is based on
propagating the trajectories of proposed flights forward in
time. FACET can be used to either simulate and display air
traffic (a 24 hour slice with 60,000 flights takes 15 minutes to
simulate on a 3 GHz, 1 GB RAM computer) or provide rapid
statistics on recorded data (4D trajectories for 10,000 flights
including sectors, airports, and fix statistics in 10 seconds
on the same computer) [11]. FACET is extensively used by
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 343
the FAA, NASA and industry (over 40 organizations and
5000 users) [11].
FACET simulates air traffic based on flight plans and
through a graphical user interface allows the user to analyze
congestion patterns of different sectors and centers (Figure
1). FACET also allows the user to change the flow patterns
of the aircraft through a number of mechanisms, including
metering aircraft through fixes. The user can then observe
the effects of these changes to congestion. In this paper,
agents use FACET directly through batch mode, where
agents send scripts to FACET asking it to simulate air 
traffic based on metering orders imposed by the agents. The
agents then produce their rewards based on receive feedback
from FACET about the impact of these meterings.
2.2 System Evaluation
The system performance evaluation function we select 
focuses on delay and congestion but does not account for 
fairness impact on different commercial entities. Instead it 
focuses on the amount of congestion in a particular sector and
on the amount of measured air traffic delay. The linear 
combination of these two terms gives the full system evaluation
function, G(z) as a function of the full system state z. More
precisely, we have:
G(z) = −((1 − α)B(z) + αC(z)) , (1)
where B(z) is the total delay penalty for all aircraft in the
system, and C(z) is the total congestion penalty. The 
relative importance of these two penalties is determined by the
value of α, and we explore various trade-offs based on α in
Section 4.
The total delay, B, is a sum of delays over a set of sectors
S and is given by:
B(z) =
X
s∈S
Bs(z) (2)
where
Bs(z) =
X
t
Θ(t − τs)kt,s(t − τs) , (3)
where ks,t is the number of aircraft in sector s at a 
particular time, τs is a predetermined time, and Θ(·) is the
step function that equals 1 when its argument is greater or
equal to zero, and has a value of zero otherwise. Intuitively,
Bs(z) provides the total number of aircraft that remain in
a sector s past a predetermined time τs, and scales their
contribution to count by the amount by which they are late.
In this manner Bs(z) provides a delay factor that not only
accounts for all aircraft that are late, but also provides a
scale to measure their lateness. This definition is based
on the assumption that most aircraft should have reached
the sector by time τs and that aircraft arriving after this
time are late. In this paper the value of τs is determined by
assessing aircraft counts in the sector in the absence of any
intervention or any deviation from predicted paths.
Similarly, the total congestion penalty is a sum over the
congestion penalties over the sectors of observation, S:
C(z) =
X
s∈S
Cs(z) (4)
where
Cs(z) = a
X
t
Θ(ks,t − cs)eb(ks,t−cs)
, (5)
where a and b are normalizing constants, and cs is the 
capacity of sector s as defined by the FAA. Intuitively, Cs(z)
penalizes a system state where the number of aircraft in a
sector exceeds the FAAs official sector capacity. Each sector
capacity is computed using various metrics which include the
number of air traffic controllers available. The exponential
penalty is intended to provide strong feedback to return the
number of aircraft in a sector to below the FAA mandated
capacities.
