As technology advances, more and more cars are being
equipped with devices, which enable them to act as 
autonomous agents. An important advancement in this 
respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks
(such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information
between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and 
optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].
Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already 
onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the 
collaboration between different cars on the road. For example, GM"s
proprietary algorithm [6], called the threat assessment 
algorithm, constantly calculates, in real time, other vehicles"
positions and speeds, and enables messaging other cars when
a collision is imminent; Also, Honda has began testing its
system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the
highway system itself [7].
In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a 
selfish agent in vehicular networks. That is, we investigate the
benefits achieved by car owners, who tamper with on-board
devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in
them, which act for their benefit. We build on the notion
of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in
which the agents can obtain road congestion information by
gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication.
We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested
agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular 
networks. In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the
objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their
own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on
the road. This situation can be modeled in real life by car
owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as 
possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars. To
this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by
injecting false information into the network. This is achieved
by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route
to other agents in the network in the hope of making the
other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing
them to choose a different route.
The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is
modeled by the self-interested agents" objective to cause
disorder in the network, more than they are interested in
maximizing their own utility. This kind of behavior could
be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who
aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible.
We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to
the network, would most probably motivate other agents to
try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.
This is similar, though in a different context, to the problem
introduced by Lamport et al. [8] as the Byzantine Generals
Problem. However, the introduction of mechanisms to deal
with self-interested agents is costly and time consuming. In
this paper we focus mainly on the attractiveness of selfish
behavior by these agents, while we also provide some insights

into the possibility of detecting self-interested agents and
minimizing their effect.
To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested
agents, we have used a simulation environment, which 
models the transportation network in a central part of a large
real city. The simulation environment is further described in
Section 3. Our simulations provide insights to the benefits
of self-interested agents cheating. Our findings can motivate
future research in this field in order to minimize the effect
of selfish-agents.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
we review related work in the field of self-interested agents
and V2V communications. We continue and formally 
describe our environment and simulation settings in Section 3.
Sections 4 and 5 describe the different behaviors of the 
selfinterested agents and our findings. Finally, we conclude the
paper with open questions and future research directions.
