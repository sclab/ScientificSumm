UTILITY
In the first set of experiments we investigated the benefits
achieved by the self-interested agents, whose aim was to 
minimize their own journey length. The self-interested agents
adopted a cheating approach, in which they sent false data
to their peers.
In this section we first describe the simulations with the
self-interested agents. Then, we model the scenario as a
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 329
game with two types of agents, and prove that the 
equilibrium result can only be achieved when there is no efficient
exchange of gossiping information in the network.
4.1 Modeling the Self-Interested Agents" 
Behavior
While the gossip agents gather data and send it to other
agents, the self-interested agents" behavior is modeled as
follows:
1. Calculate the shortest path from origin to destination.
2. Communicate the following data to other agents:
(a) If the road is not in the agent"s route - send the
true data about it (e.g., data about roads it has
received from other agents)
(b) For all roads in the agent"s route, which the agent
has not yet traversed, send a random high weight.
Basically, the self-interested agent acts the same as the 
gossip agent. It collects data regarding the weight of the roads
(either by traversing the road or by getting the data from
other agents) and sends the data it has collected to other
agents. However, the self-interested agent acts differently
when the road is in its route. Since the agent"s goal is to
reach its destination as fast as possible, the agent will falsely
report that all the roads in its route are heavily congested.
This is in order to free the path for itself, by making other
agents recalculate their paths, this time without including
roads on the self-interested agent"s route. To this end, for
all the roads in its route, which the agent has not yet passed,
the agent generates a random weight, which is above the 
average weight of the roads in the network. It then associates
these new weights with the roads in its route and sends them
to the other agents.
While an agent can also divert cars from its route by
falsely reporting congested roads in parallel to its route as
free, this behavior is not very likely since other agents, 
attempting to use the roads, will find the mistake within a
short time and spread the true congestion on the road. On
the other hand, if an agent manages to persuade other agents
not to use a road, it will be harder for them to detect that
the said roads are not congested.
In addition, to avoid being influenced by its own lies and
other lies spreading in the network, all self-interested agents
will ignore data received about roads with heavy traffic (note
that data about roads that are not heavily traffic will not
be ignored)1
.
In the next subsection we describe the simulation results,
involving the self-interested agents.
4.2 Simulation Results
To test the benefits of cheating by the self-interested agents
we ran several experiments. In the first set of experiments,
we created a scenario, in which a small group of self-interested
agents spread lies on the same route, and tested its 
effect on the journey length of all the agents in the network.
1
In other simulations we have run, in which there had been
several real congestions in the network, we indeed saw that
even when the roads are jammed, the self-interested agents
were less affected if they ignored all reported heavy traffic,
since by such they also discarded all lies roaming the network

Thus, several cars, which had the same origin and 
destination points, were designated as self-interested agents. In this
simulation, we selected only 6 agents to be part of the group
of the self-interested agents, as we wanted to investigate the
effect achieved by only a small number of agents.
In each simulation in this experiment, 6 different agents
were randomly chosen to be part of the group of self-interested
agents, as described above. In addition, one road, on the
route of these agents, was randomly selected to be partially
blocked, letting only one car go through that road at each
time step. About 8,000 agents were randomly selected as
regular gossip agents, and the other 32,000 agents were 
designated as regular agents.
We analyzed the average journey length of the self-interested
agents as opposed to the average journey length of other
regular gossip agents traveling along the same route. Table
1 summarizes the normalized results for the self-interested
agents, the gossip agents (those having the same origin and
destination points as the self-interested agents, denoted 
Gossip - SR, and all other gossip agents, denoted Gossip - 
Others) and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration
number.
We can see from the results that the first time the 
selfinterested agents traveled the route while spreading the false
data about the roads did not help them (using the paired
t-test we show that those agents had significantly lower 
journey lengths in the scenario in which they did not spread any
lies, with p < 0.01). This is mainly due to the fact that
the lies do not bypass the self-interested agent and reach
other cars that are ahead of the self-interested car on the
same route. Thus, spreading the lies in the first iteration
does not help the self-interested agent to free the route he
is about to travel, in the first iteration.
Only when the self-interested agents had repeated their
journey in the next iteration (iteration 2) did it help them
significantly (p = 0.04). The reason for this is that other 
gossip agents received this data and used it to recalculate their
shortest path, thus avoiding entrance to the roads, for which
the self-interested agents had spread false information about
congestion. It is also interesting to note the large value
attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration.
This is mainly due to several self-interested agents, who 
entered the jammed road. This situation occurred since the
self-interested agents ignored all heavy traffic data, and thus
ignored the fact that the road was jammed. As they started
spreading lies about this road, more cars shifted from this
route, thus making the road free for the future iterations.
However, we also recall that the self-interested agents 
ignore all information about the heavy traffic roads. Thus,

when the network becomes congested, more self-interested
cars are affected, since they might enter jammed roads,
which they would otherwise not have entered. This can be
seen, for example, in iterations 4-6, in which the normalized
value of the self-interested agents increased above 1.00. 
Using the paired t-test to compare these values with the values
achieved by these agents when no lies are used, we see that
there is no significant difference between the two scenarios.
As opposed to the gossip agents, we can see how little
effect the self-interested agents have on the regular agents.
As compared to the gossip agents on the same route that
have traveled as much as 193% more, when self-interested
agents are introduced, the average journey length for the
regular agents has only increased by about 15%. This result
is even lower than the effect on other gossip agents in the
entire network.
Since we noticed that cheating by the self-interested agents
does not benefit them in the first iteration, we devised 
another set of experiments. In the second set of experiments,
the self-interested agents have the objective to help another
agent, who is supposed to enter the network some time 
after the self-interested agent entered. We refer to the latter
agent as the beneficiary agent. Just like a self-interested
agent, the beneficiary agent also ignores all data regarding
heavy traffic. In real-life this can be modeled, for 
example, by a husband, who would like to help his wife find a
faster route to her destination. Table 2 summarizes the 
normalized values for the different agents. As in the first set
of experiments, 5 simulations were run for each scenario,
with a total of 25 simulations. In each of these simulation
one agent was randomly selected as a self-interested agent,
and then another agent, with the same origin as the 
selfinterested agent, was randomly selected as the beneficiary
agent. The other 8,000 and 32,000 agents were designated
as regular gossip agents and regular agents, respectively.
We can see that as the number of iterations advances, the
lower the normalized value for the beneficiary agent. In this
scenario, just like the previous one, in the first iterations,
not only does the beneficiary agent not avoid the jammed
roads, since he ignores all heavy traffic, he also does not
benefit from the lies spread by the self-interested agent. This
is due to the fact that the lies are not yet incorporated by
other gossip agents. Thus, if we compare the average journey
length in the first iteration when lies are spread and when
there are no lies, the average is significantly lower when there
are no lies (p < 0.03). On the other hand, if we compare
the average journey length in all of the iterations, there is
no significant difference between the two settings. Still, in
most of the iterations, the average journey length of the
beneficiary agent is longer than in the case when no lies are
spread.
We can also see the impact on the other agents in the
system. While the gossip agents, which are not on the
route of the beneficiary agent, virtually are not affected by
the self-interested agent, those on the route and the 
regular agents are affected and have higher normalized values.
That is, even with just one self-interested car, we can see
that both the gossip agents that follow the same route as
the lies spread by the self-interested agents, and other 
regular agents, increase their journey length by more than 14%.
In our third set of experiments we examined a setting in
which there was an increasing number of agents, and the
agents did not necessarily have the same origin and 
destination points. To model this we randomly selected 
selfinterested agents, whose objective was to minimize their
average journey length, assuming the cars were repeating
their journeys (that is, more than one iteration was made).
As opposed to the first set of experiments, in this set the
self-interested agents were selected randomly, and we did
not enforce the constraint that they will all have the same
origin and destination points.
As in the previous sets of experiments we ran 5 
different simulations per scenario. In each simulation 11 runs
were made, each run with different numbers of self-interested
agents: 0 (no self-interested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Each
agent adopted the behavior modeled in Section 4.1. Figure
1 shows the normalized value achieved by the self-interested
agents as a function of their number. The figure shows these
values for iterations 2-6. The first iteration is not shown 
intentionally, as we assume repeated journeys. Also, we have
seen in the previous set of experiments and we have 
provided explanations as to why the self-interested agents do
not gain much from their behavior in the first iteration.

a function of the number of self-interested agents.
Using these simulations we examined what the threshold
could be for the number of randomly selected self-interested
agents in order to allow themselves to benefit from their
selfish behavior. We can see that up to 8 self-interested
agents, the average normalized value is below 1. That is,
they benefit from their malicious behavior. In the case of
one self-interested agent there is a significant difference 
between the average journey length of when the agent spread
lies and when no lies are spread (p < 0.001), while when
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 331
there are 2, 4, 8 and 16 self-interested agents there is no
significance difference. Yet, as the number of self-interested
agents increases, the normalized value also increases. In
such cases, the normalized value is larger than 1, and the
self-interested agents journey length becomes significantly
higher than their journey length, in cases where there are
no self-interested agents in the system.
In the next subsection we analyze the scenario as a game
and show that when in equilibrium the exchange of gossiping
between the agents becomes inefficient.
4.3 When Gossiping is Inefficient
We continued and modeled our scenario as a game, in 
order to find the equilibrium. There are two possible types for
the agents: (a) regular gossip agents, and (b) self-interested
agents. Each of these agents is a representative of its group,
and thus all agents in the same group have similar behavior.
We note that the advantage of using gossiping in 
transportation networks is to allow the agents to detect anomalies
in the network (e.g., traffic jams) and to quickly adapt to
them by recalculating their routes [14]. We also assume that
the objective of the self-interested agents is to minimize their
own journey length, thus they spread lies on their routes, as
described in Section 4.1. We also assume that sophisticated
methods for identifying the self-interested agents or 
managing reputation are not used. This is mainly due to the 
complexity of incorporating and maintaining such mechanisms,
as well as due to the dynamics of the network, in which 
interactions between different agents are frequent, agents may
leave the network, and data about the road might change as
time progresses (e.g., a road might be reported by a regular
gossip agent as free at a given time, yet it may currently be
jammed due to heavy traffic on the road).
Let Tavg be the average time it takes to traverse an edge
in the transportation network (that is, the average load of
an edge). Let Tmax be the maximum time it takes to 
traverse an edge. We will investigate the game, in which the
self-interested and the regular gossip agents can choose the
following actions. The self-interested agents can choose how
much to lie, that is, they can choose to spread how long (not
necessarily the true duration) it takes to traverse certain
roads. Since the objective of the self-interested agents is to
spread messages as though some roads are jammed, the 
traversal time they report is obviously larger than the average
time. We denote the time the self-interested agents spread
as Ts, such that Tavg ≤ Ts ≤ Tmax. Motivated by the 
results of the simulations we have described above, we saw that
the agents are less affected if they discard the heavy traffic
values. Thus, the regular gossip cars, attempting to 
mitigate the effect of the liars, can choose a strategy to ignore
abnormal congestion values above a certain threshold, Tg.
Obviously, Tavg ≤ Tg ≤ Tmax. In order to prevent the 
gossip agents from detecting the lies and just discarding those
values, the self-interested agents send lies in a given range,
[Ts, Tmax], with an inverse geometric distribution, that is,
the higher the T value, the higher its frequency.
Now we construct the utility functions for each type of
agents, which is defined by the values of Ts and Tg. If the
self-interested agents spread traversal times higher than or
equal to the regular gossip cars" threshold, they will not
benefit from those lies. Thus, the utility value of the 
selfinterested agents in this case is 0. On the other hand, if the
self-interested agents spread traversal time which is lower
than the threshold, they will gain a positive utility value.
From the regular gossip agents point-of-view, if they accept
messages from the self-interested agents, then they 
incorporate the lies in their calculation, thus they will lose utility
points. On the other hand, if they discard the false values
the self-interested agents send, that is, they do not 
incorporate the lies, they will gain utility values. Formally, we use
us
to denote the utility of the self-interested agents and ug
to denote the utility of the regular gossip agents. We also
denote the strategy profile in the game as {Ts, Tg}. The
utility functions are defined as:
us
=
0 if Ts ≥ Tg
Ts − Tavg + 1 if Ts < Tg
(1)
ug
=
Tg − Tavg if Ts ≥ Tg
Ts − Tg if Ts < Tg
(2)
We are interested in finding the Nash equilibrium. We
recall from [12], that the Nash equilibrium is a strategy 
profile, where no player has anything to gain by deviating from
his strategy, given that the other agent follows his strategy
profile. Formally, let (S, u) denote the game, where S is
the set of strategy profiles and u is the set of utility 
functions. When each agent i ∈ {regular gossip, self-interested}
chooses a strategy Ti resulting in a strategy profile T =
(Ts, Tg) then agent i obtains a utility of ui
(T). A strategy
profile T∗
∈ S is a Nash equilibrium if no deviation in the
strategy by any single agent is profitable, that is, if for all i,
ui
(T∗
) ≥ ui
(Ti, T∗
−i). That is, (Ts, Tg) is a Nash equilibrium
if the self-interested agents have no other value Ts such that
us
(Ts, Tg) > us
(Ts, Tg), and similarly for the gossip agents.
We now have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1. (Tavg, Tavg) is the only Nash equilibrium.
Proof. First we will show that (Tavg, Tavg) is a Nash 
equilibrium. Assume, by contradiction, that the gossip agents
choose another value Tg > Tavg. Thus, ug
(Tavg, Tg ) =
Tavg − Tg < 0. On the other hand, ug
(Tavg, Tavg) = 0.
Thus, the regular gossip agents have no incentive to 
deviate from this strategy. The self-interested agents also have
no incentive to deviate from this strategy. By 
contradiction, again assume that the self-interested agents choose
another value Ts > Tavg. Thus, us
(Ts , Tavg) = 0, while
us
(Tavg, Tavg) = 0.
We will now show that the above solution is unique. We
will show that any other tuple (Ts, Tg), such that Tavg <
Tg ≤ Tmax and Tavg < Ts ≤ Tmax is not a Nash equilibrium.
We have three cases. In the first Tavg < Tg < Ts ≤ Tmax.
Thus, us
(Ts, Tg) = 0 and ug
(Ts, Tg) = Tg − Tavg. In this
case, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate
and choose another strategy Tg + 1, since by doing so they
increase their own utility: ug
(Ts, Tg + 1) = Tg + 1 − Tavg.
In the second case we have Tavg < Ts < Tg ≤ Tmax. Thus,
ug
(Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg < 0. Also, the regular gossip agents
have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy
Tg −1, in which their utility value is higher: ug
(Ts, Tg −1) =
Ts − Tg + 1.
In the last case we have Tavg < Ts = Tg ≤ Tmax. Thus,
us
(Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg = 0. In this case, the self-interested
agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another 
strategy Tg − 1, in which their utility value is higher: us
(Tg −
1, Tg) = Tg − 1 − Tavg + 1 = Tg − Tavg > 0.

The above theorem proves that the equilibrium point is
reached only when the self-interested agents send the time
to traverse certain edges equals the average time, and on
the other hand the regular gossip agents discard all data 
regarding roads that are associated with an average time or
higher. Thus, for this equilibrium point the exchange of 
gossiping information between agents is inefficient, as the gossip
agents are unable to detect any anomalies in the network.
In the next section we describe another scenario for the
self-interested agents, in which they are not concerned with
their own utility, but rather interested in maximizing the
average journey length of other gossip agents.
