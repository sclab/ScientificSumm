Another possible behavior that can be adopted by 
selfinterested agents is characterized by their goal to cause 
disorder in the network. This can be achieved, for example, by
maximizing the average journey length of all agents, even at
the cost of maximizing their own journey length.
To understand the vulnerability of the gossip based 
transportation support system, we ran 5 different simulations for
each scenario. In each simulation different agents were 
randomly chosen (using a uniform distribution) to act as 
gossip agents, among them self-interested agents were chosen.
Each self-interested agent behaved in the same manner as
described in Section 4.1.
Every simulation consisted of 11 runs with each run 
comprising different numbers of self-interested agents: 0 (no 
selfinterested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 50, 64, 80 and 100.
Also, in each run the number of self-interested agents was
increased incrementally. For example: the run with 50 
selfinterested agents consisted of all the self-interested agents
that were used in the run with 32 self-interested agents, but
with an additional 18 self-interested agents.
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the normalized journey length
for the self-interested agents, the regular gossip agents and
the regular (non-gossip) agents. Table 3 summarizes the
data for the first iteration and Table 4 summarizes the data
for the average of all iterations. Figure 2 demonstrates
the changes in the normalized values for the regular gossip
agents and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration
number. Similar to the results in our first set of experiments,
described in Section 4.2, we can see that randomly selected
self-interested agents who follow different randomly selected
routes do not benefit from their malicious behavior (that is,
their average journey length does not decrease). However,
when only one self-interested agent is involved, it does 
benefit from the malicious behavior, even in the first iteration.
The results also indicate that the regular gossip agents are
more sensitive to malicious behavior than regular 
agentsthe average journey length for the gossip agents increases
significantly (e.g., with 32 self-interested agents the average
journey length for the gossip agents was 146% higher than
in the setting with no self-interested agents at all, as 
opposed to an increase of only 25% for the regular agents). In
contrast, these results also indicate that the self-interested
agents do not succeed in causing a significant load in the
network by their malicious behavior.

Since the goal of the self-interested agents in this case is
to cause disorder in the network rather than use the lies for
their own benefits, the question arises as to why would the
behavior of the self-interested agents be to send lies about
their routes only. Furthermore, we hypothesize that if they
all send lies about the same major roads the damage they
might inflict on the entire network would be larger that had
each of them sent lies about its own route. To examine this
hypothesis, we designed another set of experiments. In this
set of experiments, all the self-interested agents spread lies
about the same 13 main roads in the network. However, the
results show quite a smaller impact on other gossip and

lar agents in the network. The average normalized value for
the gossip agents in these simulations was only about 1.07,
as opposed to 1.7 in the original scenario. When analyzing
the results we saw that although the false data was spread,
it did not cause other gossip cars to change their route. The
main reason was that the lies were spread on roads that were
not on the route of the self-interested agents. Thus, it took
the data longer to reach agents on the main roads, and when
the agents reached the relevant roads this data was too old
to be incorporated in the other agents calculations.
We also examined the impact of sending lies in order to
cause chaos when there are already congestions in the 
network. To this end, we simulated a network in which 13 main
roads are jammed. The behavior of the self-interested agents
is as described in Section 4.1, and the self-interested agents
spread lies about their own route. The simulation results,
detailed in Table 5, show that there is a greater incentive
for the self-interested agents to cheat when the network is
already congested, as their cheating causes more damage
to the other agents in the network. For example, whereas
the average journey length of the regular agents increased
only by about 15% in the original scenario, in which the 
network was not congested, in this scenario the average journey
length of the agents had increased by about 60%.
