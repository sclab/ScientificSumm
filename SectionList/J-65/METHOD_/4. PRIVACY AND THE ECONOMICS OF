IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION
The problem of immediate gratification (which is related
to the concepts of time inconsistency, hyperbolic 
discounting, and self-control bias) is so described by O"Donoghue and
Rabin [27, p. 4]: A person"s relative preference for 
wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the
earlier date gets closer. [...] [P]eople have self-control 
problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification
in a way that their ‘long-run selves" do not appreciate. For
example, if you were given only two alternatives, on Monday
you may claim you will prefer working 5 hours on Saturday
to 5 hours and half on Sunday. But as Saturday comes, you
will be more likely to prefer postponing work until Sunday.
This simple observation has rather important consequences
in economic theory, where time-consistency of preferences is
the dominant model. Consider first the traditional model
of utility that agents derive from consumption: the model
states that utility discounts exponentially over time:
Ut =
T
τ=t
δτ
uτ (2)
In Equation 2, the cumulative utility U at time t is the
discounted sum of all utilities from time t (the present) until
time T (the future). δ is the discount factor, with a value

between 0 and 1. A value of 0 would imply that the 
individual discounts so heavily that the utility from future periods
is worth zero today. A value of 1 would imply that the 
individual is so patient she does not discount future utilities.
The discount factor is used in economics to capture the fact
that having (say) one dollar one year from now is valuable,
but not as much as having that dollar now. In Equation 2,
if all uτ were constant - for instance, 10 - and δ was 0.9,
then at time t = 0 (that is, now) u0 would be worth 10, but
u1 would be worth 9.
Modifying the traditional model of utility discounting, [23]
and then [31] have proposed a model which takes into 
account possible time-inconsistency of preferences. Consider
Equation 3:
Ut(ut, ut+1, ..., uT ) = δt
ut + β
T
τ=t+1
δτ
uτ (3)
Assume that δ, β ∈ [0, 1]. δ is the discount factor for 
intertemporal utility as in Equation 2. β is the parameter
that captures an individual"s tendency to gratify herself 
immediately (a form of time-inconsistent preferences). When
β is 1, the model maps the traditional time-consistent 
utility model, and Equation 3 is identical to Equation 2. But
when β is zero, the individual does not care for anything but
today. In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control
bias.
The experimental literature has convincingly proved that
human beings tend to have self-control problems even when
they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone 
undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort
tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities
even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in
the future.
This analytical framework can be applied to the study
of privacy attitudes and behavior. Protecting your privacy
sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present
hassle (telemarketers, or people peeping through your 
window and seeing how you live - see [33]); but sometimes it
represents something akin to getting an insurance against
future and only uncertain risks. In surveys completed at
time t = 0, subjects asked about their attitude towards 
privacy risks may mentally consider some costs of protecting
themselves at a later time t = s and compare those to the
avoided costs of privacy intrusions in an even more distant
future t = s + n. Their alternatives at survey time 0 are
represented in Equation 4.
min
wrt x
DU0 = β[(E(cs,p)δs
x) + (E(cs+n,i)δs+n
(1 − x))] (4)
x is a dummy variable that can take values 0 or 1. It
represents the individual"s choice - which costs the 
individual opts to face: the expected cost of protecting herself at
time s, E(cs,p) (in which case x = 1), or the expected costs
of being subject to privacy intrusions at a later time s + n,
E(cs+n,i).
The individual is trying to minimize the disutility DU of
these costs with respect to x. Because she discounts the
two future events with the same discount factor (although
at different times), for certain values of the parameters the
individual may conclude that paying to protect herself is
worthy. In particular, this will happen when:
E(cs,p)δs
< E(cs+n,i)δs+n
(5)
Now, consider what happens as the moment t = s comes.
Now a real price should be paid in order to enjoy some form
of protection (say, starting to encrypt all of your emails to
protect yourself from future intrusions). Now the individual
will perceive a different picture:
min
wrt x
DUs = δE(cs,p)x + βE(cn,i)δn
(1 − x)] (6)
Note that nothing has changed in the equation (certainly
not the individual"s perceived risks) except time. If β (the
parameter indicating the degree of self-control problems) is
less than one, chances are that the individual now will 
actually choose not to protect herself. This will in fact happen
when:
δE(cs,p) > βE(cn,i)δn
(7)
Note that Disequalities 5 and 7 may be simultaneously
met for certain β < 1. At survey time the individual 
honestly claimed she wanted to protect herself in 
principlethat is, some time in the future. But as she is asked to
make an effort to protect herself right now, she chooses to
run the risk of privacy intrusion.
Similar mathematical arguments can be made for the 
comparison between immediate costs with immediate benefits
(subscribing to a ‘no-call" list to stop telemarketers from
harassing you at dinner), and immediate costs with only
future expected rewards (insuring yourself against identity
theft, or protecting yourself from frauds by never using your
credit card on-line), particularly when expected future 
rewards (or avoided risks) are also intangible: the immaterial
consequences of living (or not) in a dossier society, or the
chilling effects (or lack thereof) of being under surveillance.
The reader will have noticed that we have focused on 
perceived (expected) costs E(c), rather than real costs. We
do not know the real costs and we do not claim that the
25
individual does. But we are able to show that under 
certain conditions even costs perceived as very high (as during
periods of intense privacy debate) will be ignored.
We can provide some fictional numerical examples to make
the analysis more concrete. We present some scenarios 
inspired by the calculations in [31].
Imagine an economy with just 4 periods (Table 1). Each
individual can enroll in a supermarket"s loyalty program by
revealing personal information. If she does so, the individual
gets a discount of 2 during the period of enrollment, only to
pay one unit each time thereafter because of price 
discrimination based on the information she revealed (we make no
attempt at calibrating the realism of this obviously abstract
example; the point we are focusing on is how time 
inconsistencies may affect individual behavior given the expected
costs and benefits of certain actions).4
Depending on which
period the individual chooses for ‘selling" her data, we have
the undiscounted payoffs represented in Table 1.
Imagine that the individual is contemplating these 
options and discounting them according to Equation 3. 
Suppose that δ = 1 for all types of individuals (this means that
for simplicity we do not consider intertemporal discounting)
but β = 1/2 for time-inconsistent individuals and β = 1 for
everybody else. The time-consistent individual will choose
to join the program at the very last period and rip off a
benefit of 2-1=1. The individual with immediate 
gratification problems, for whom β = 1/2, will instead perceive the
benefits from joining now or in period 3 as equivalent (0.5),
and will join the program now, thus actually making herself
worse off.
[31] also suggest that, in addition to the distinction 
between time-consistent individuals and individuals with 
timeinconsistent preferences, we should also distinguish 
timeinconsistent individuals who are na¨ıve from those who are
sophisticated. Na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals are not
aware of their self-control problems - for example, they are
those who always plan to start a diet next week. 
Sophisticated time-inconsistent individuals suffer of immediate 
gratification bias, but are at least aware of their inconsistencies.
People in this category choose their behavior today correctly
estimating their future time-inconsistent behavior.
Now consider how this difference affects decisions in 
another scenario, represented in Table 2. An individual is 
considering the adoption of a certain privacy enhancing 
technology. It will cost her some money both to protect herself
and not to protect herself. If she decides to protect herself,
the cost will be the amount she pays - for example - for some
technology that shields her personal information. If she 
decides not to protect herself, the cost will be the expected
consequences of privacy intrusions.
We assume that both these aggregate costs increase over
time, although because of separate dynamics. As time goes
by, more and more information about the individual has
been revealed, and it becomes more costly to be protected
against privacy intrusions. At the same time, however, 
intrusions become more frequent and dangerous.

One may claim that loyalty cards keep on providing 
benefits over time. Here we make the simplifying assumption
that such benefits are not larger than the future costs 
incurred after having revealed one"s tastes. We also assume
that the economy ends in period 4 for all individuals, 
regardless of when they chose to join the loyalty program.
In period 1, the individual may protect herself by spending
5, or she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the
following period, expected to cost 7. In the second period,
assuming that no intrusion has yet taken place, she may
once again protect herself by spending a little more, 6; or
she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the next
(third) period, expected to cost 9. In the third period she
could protect herself for 8 or face an expected cost of 15 in
the following last period.
Here too we make no attempt at calibrating the values in
Table 2. Again, we focus on the different behavior driven by
heterogeneity in time-consistency and sophistication versus
na¨ıvete. We assume that β = 1 for individuals with no
self control problems and β = 1/2 for everybody else. We
assume for simplicity that δ = 1 for all.
The time-consistent individuals will obviously choose to
protect themselves as soon as possible.
In the first period, na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals will
compare the costs of protecting themselves then or face a
privacy intrusion in the second period. Because 5 > 7 ∗
(1/2), they will prefer to wait until the following period to
protect themselves. But in the second period they will be
comparing 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2) - and so they will postpone their
protection again. They will keep on doing so, facing higher
and higher risks. Eventually, they will risk to incur the
highest perceived costs of privacy intrusions (note again that
we are simply assuming that individuals believe there are
privacy risks and that they increase over time; we will come
back to this concept later on).
Time-inconsistent but sophisticated individuals, on the
other side, will adopt a protective technology in period 2
and pay 6. By period 2, in fact, they will (correctly) realize
that if they wait till period 3 (which they are tempted to
do, because 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2)), their self-control bias will lead
them to postpone adopting the technology once more 
(because 8 > 15 ∗ (1/2)). Therefore they predict they would
incur the expected cost 15 ∗ (1/2), which is larger than 
6the cost of protecting oneself in period 2. In period 1, 
however, they correctly predict that they will not wait to protect
themselves further than period 2. So they wait till period
2, because 5 > 6 ∗ (1/2), at which time they will adopt a
protective technology (see also [31]).
To summarize, time-inconsistent people tend not to fully
appreciate future risks and, if na¨ıve, also their inability to
deal with them. This happens even if they are aware of those
risks and they are aware that those risks are increasing. As
we learnt from the second scenario, time inconsistency can
lead individuals to accept higher and higher risks. 
Individuals may tend to downplay the fact that single actions present
low risks, but their repetition forms a huge liability: it is a
deceiving aspect of privacy that its value is truly 
appreciated only after privacy itself is lost. This dynamics captures
the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets [32,
14], where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to
others, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.
In addition, [31] show that when costs are immediate,
time-inconsistent individuals tend to procrastinate; when
benefits are immediate, they tend to preoperate. In our 
context things are even more interesting because all privacy
decisions involve at the same time costs and benefits. So
we opt against using eCash [9] in order to save us the costs
of switching from credit cards. But we accept the risk that
our credit card number on the Internet could be used

liciously. And we give away our personal information to
supermarkets in order to gain immediate discounts - which
will likely turn into price discrimination in due time [3, 26].
We have shown in the second scenario above how 
sophisticated but time-inconsistent individuals may choose to 
protect their information only in period 2. Sophisticated 
people with self-control problems may be at a loss, sometimes
even when compared to na¨ıve people with time 
inconsistency problems (how many privacy advocates do use 
privacy enhancing technologies all the time?). The reasoning
is that sophisticated people are aware of their self-control
problems, and rather than ignoring them, they incorporate
them into their decision process. This may decrease their
own incentive to behave in the optimal way now. 
Sophisticated privacy advocates might realize that protecting 
themselves from any possible privacy intrusion is unrealistic, and
so they may start misbehaving now (and may get used to
that, a form of coherent arbitrariness). This is consistent
with the results by [36] presented at the ACM EC "01 
conference. [36] found that privacy advocates were also willing
to reveal personal information in exchange for monetary 
rewards.
It is also interesting to note that these inconsistencies are
not caused by ignorance of existing risks or confusion about
available technologies. Individuals in the abstract scenarios
we described are aware of their perceived risks and costs.
However, under certain conditions, the magnitude of those
liabilities is almost irrelevant. The individual will take very
slowly increasing risks, which become steps towards huge
liabilities.
