COMMERCE
Privacy remains an important issue for electronic 
commerce. A PriceWaterhouseCoopers study in 2000 showed
that nearly two thirds of the consumers surveyed would
shop more online if they knew retail sites would not do 
anything with their personal information [15]. A Federal Trade
Commission study reported in 2000 that sixty-seven 
percent of consumers were very concerned about the privacy
of the personal information provided on-line [11]. More 
recently, a February 2002 Harris Interactive survey found that
the three biggest consumer concerns in the area of on-line
personal information security were: companies trading 
personal data without permission, the consequences of insecure
transactions, and theft of personal data [19]. According to
a Jupiter Research study in 2002, $24.5 billion in on-line
sales will be lost by 2006 - up from $5.5 billion in 2001. 
Online retail sales would be approximately twenty-four percent
higher in 2006 if consumers" fears about privacy and 
security were addressed effectively [21]. Although the media
hype has somewhat diminished, risks and costs have 
notas evidenced by the increasing volumes of electronic spam
and identity theft [16].
Surveys in this field, however, as well as experiments and
anecdotal evidence, have also painted a different picture.
[36, 10, 18, 21] have found evidence that even privacy 
concerned individuals are willing to trade-off privacy for 
convenience, or bargain the release of very personal information in
exchange for relatively small rewards. The failure of several
on-line services aimed at providing anonymity for Internet
users [6] offers additional indirect evidence of the reluctance
by most individuals to spend any effort in protecting their
personal information.
The dichotomy between privacy attitudes and behavior
has been highlighted in the literature. Preliminary 
interpretations of this phenomenon have been provided [2, 38,
33, 40]. Still missing are: an explanation grounded in 
economic or psychological theories; an empirical validation of
the proposed explanation; and, of course, the answer to the
most recurring question: should people bother at all about
privacy?
In this paper we focus on the first question: we formally
analyze the individual decision making process with respect
to privacy and its possible shortcomings. We focus on 
individual (mis)conceptions about their handling of risks they
face when revealing private information. We do not address
the issue of whether people should actually protect 
themselves. We will comment on that in Section 5, where we will
also discuss strategies to empirically validate our theory.
We apply lessons from behavioral economics. Traditional
economics postulates that people are forward-looking and
bayesian updaters: they take into account how current 
behavior will influence their future well-being and preferences.
For example, [5] study rational models of addiction. This
approach can be compared to those who see in the decision
21
not to protect one"s privacy a rational choice given the 
(supposedly) low risks at stake. However, developments in the
area of behavioral economics have highlighted various forms
of psychological inconsistencies (self-control problems, 
hyperbolic discounting, present-biases, etc.) that clash with
the fully rational view of the economic agent. In this 
paper we draw from these developments to reach the following
conclusions:
• We show that it is unlikely that individuals can act
rationally in the economic sense when facing privacy
sensitive decisions.
• We show that alternative models of personal behavior
and time-inconsistent preferences are compatible with
the dichotomy between attitudes and behavior and can
better match current data. For example, they can 
explain the results presented by [36] at the ACM EC
"01 conference. In their experiment, self-proclaimed
privacy advocates were found to be willing to reveal
varying amounts of personal information in exchange
for small rewards.
• In particular, we show that individuals may have a 
tendency to under-protect themselves against the privacy
risks they perceive, and over-provide personal 
information even when wary of (perceived) risks involved.
• We show that the magnitude of the perceived costs of
privacy under certain conditions will not act as 
deterrent against behavior the individual admits is risky.
• We show, following similar studies in the economics of
immediate gratification [31], that even ‘sophisticated"
individuals may under certain conditions become 
‘privacy myopic."
Our conclusion is that simply providing more 
information and awareness in a self-regulative environment is not
sufficient to protect individual privacy. Improved 
technologies, by lowering costs of adoption and protection, certainly
can help. However, more fundamental human behavioral
responses must also be addressed if privacy ought to be 
protected.
In the next section we propose a model of rational agents
facing privacy sensitive decisions. In Section 3 we show the
difficulties that hinder any model of privacy decision 
making based on full rationality. In Section 4 we show how 
behavioral models based on immediate gratification bias can
better explain the attitudes-behavior dichotomy and match
available data. In Section 5 we summarize and discuss our
conclusions.
