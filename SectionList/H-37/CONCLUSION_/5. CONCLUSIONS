In the past, academic researchers and industrial 
practitioners have disagreed on the best method for online 
contentbased detection of spam on the web. We have presented one
resolution to this debate. Online SVMs do, indeed, 
proTable 7: Splog Data Set. These results compare
Online SVM and ROSVM on splog detection using
binary 4-gram feature space.

duce state-of-the-art performance on this task with proper
adjustment of the tradeoff parameter C, but with cost that
grows quadratically with the size of the data set. The high
values of C required for best performance with SVMs show
that the margin maximization of Online SVMs is overkill for
this task. Thus, we have proposed a less expensive 
alternative, ROSVM, that relaxes this maximum margin 
requirement, and produces nearly equivalent results. These 
methods are efficient enough for large-scale filtering of 
contentbased spam in its many forms.
It is natural to ask why the task of content-based spam 
detection gets strong performance from ROSVM. After all, not
all data allows the relaxation of SVM requirements. We 
conjecture that email spam, blog comment spam, and splogs all
share the characteristic that a subset of features are 
particularly indicative of content being either spam or not spam.
These indicative features may be sparsely represented in the
data set, because of spam methods such as word obfuscation,
in which common spam words are intentionally misspelled in
an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of word-based spam
detection. Maximizing the margin may cause these sparsely
represented features to be ignored, creating an overall 
reduction in performance. It appears that spam data is highly
separable, allowing ROSVM to be successful with high 
values of C and little effort given to maximizing the margin.
Future work will determine how applicable relaxed SVMs
are to the general problem of text classification.
Finally, we note that the success of relaxed SVM methods
for content-based spam detection is a result that depends
on the nature of spam data, which is potentially subject to
change. Although it is currently true that ham and spam
are linearly separable given an appropriate feature space,
this assumption may be subject to attack. While our current
methods appear robust against primitive attacks along these
lines, such as the good word attack [24], we must explore the
feasibility of more sophisticated attacks.
