Electronic communication is increasingly plagued by 
unwanted or harmful content known as spam. The most well
known form of spam is email spam, which remains a major
problem for large email systems. Other forms of spam are
also becoming problematic, including blog spam, in which
spammers post unwanted comments in blogs [21], and splogs,
which are fake blogs constructed to enable link spam with
the hope of boosting the measured importance of a given
webpage in the eyes of automated search engines [17]. There
are a variety of methods for identifying these many forms
of spam, including compiling blacklists of known spammers,
and conducting link analysis.
The approach of content analysis has shown particular
promise and generality for combating spam. In content 
analysis, the actual message text (often including hyper-text and
meta-text, such as HTML and headers) is analyzed using
machine learning techniques for text classification to 
determine if the given content is spam. Content analysis has
been widely applied in detecting email spam [11], and has
also been used for identifying blog spam [21] and splogs [17].
In this paper, we do not explore the related problem of link
spam, which is currently best combated by link analysis [13].
1.1 An Anti-Spam Controversy
The anti-spam community has been divided on the choice
of the best machine learning method for content-based spam
detection. Academic researchers have tended to favor the
use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a statistically 
robust machine learning method [7] which yields 
state-of-theart performance on general text classification [14]. However,
SVMs typically require training time that is quadratic in the
number of training examples, and are impractical for 
largescale email systems. Practitioners requiring content-based
spam filtering have typically chosen to use the faster (if
less statistically robust) machine learning method of Naive
Bayes text classification [11, 12, 20]. This Bayesian method
requires only linear training time, and is easily implemented
in an online setting with incremental updates. This allows a
deployed system to easily adapt to a changing environment
over time. Other fast methods for spam filtering include
compression models [1] and logistic regression [10]. It has
not yet been empirically demonstrated that SVMs give 
improved performance over these methods in an online spam
detection setting [4].
1.2 Contributions
In this paper, we address the anti-spam controversy and
offer a potential resolution. We first demonstrate that 
online SVMs do indeed provide state-of-the-art spam detection
through empirical tests on several large benchmark data sets
of email spam. We then analyze the effect of the tradeoff
parameter in the SVM objective function, which shows that
the expensive SVM methodology may, in fact, be overkill for
spam detection. We reduce the computational cost of SVM
learning by relaxing this requirement on the maximum 
margin in online settings, and create a Relaxed Online SVM,
ROSVM, appropriate for high performance content-based
spam filtering in large-scale settings.
