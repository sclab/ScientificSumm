This paper presents the first investigation on utility-based
information distillation with a system that learns the 
longlasting information needs from fine-grained user feedback
over a sequence of ranked passages. Our system, called CAFÂ´E,
combines adaptive filtering, novelty detection and 
antiredundant passage ranking in a unified framework for utility
optimization. We developed a new scheme for automated
evaluation and feedback based on a semi-automatic 
procedure for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching
nuggets against system responses. We also proposed an
extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of
ranked passages as a weighted combination of relevance and
novelty. Our experiments on the newly annotated TDT4
benchmark corpus show encouraging utility enhancement
over Indri, and also over our own system with incremental
learning and novelty detection turned off.
