The PS mechanism at each peer is essentially a 
progressive search within the local image for a subset of parent
peers such that the following design goals are achieved: (i)
maximizing delivered bandwidth 5
, (ii) minimizing the total
delay from all parents to the receiver, and (iii) 
maximizing diversity of paths from parents (whenever it is feasible).
Whenever these goals are in conflict, a receiver optimizes
the goal with the highest priority. Currently, our framework
does not directly consider diversity of paths from different
parents as a criteria for parent selection. However, the 
indirect effect of shared path among parents is addressed 
because of its potential impact on available bandwidth from
a parent when two or more parents are behind the same
bottleneck.
The number of active parents (nopi(t)) for each receiver
should be within a configured range [min nop, max nop].
Each receiver tries to maximize its delivered bandwidth with
the minimum number of parents. If this goal can not be
achieved after evaluation of a certain number of new 
parents, the receiver will gradually increase its number of 
parents. This flexibility is important in order to utilize 
available bandwidth from low bandwidth parents, i.e., cope with
bandwidth heterogeneity. min nop determines minimum
degree of resilience to parent departure, and minimum level
of path diversity (whenever diverse paths are available). The
number of children for each peer should not be limited. 
Instead, each peer only limits maximum outgoing bandwidth
that it is able (or willing) to provide to its children. This
allows child peers to compete for congestion controlled 
bandwidth from a parent which motivates child peers with poor
bandwidth connectivity to look for other parents (i.e., 
properly reshape the overlay).
Design of a PS mechanism should address three main
questions as follows:
1) When should a new parent be selected?
There is a fundamental tradeoff between responsiveness of
a receiver to changes in network conditions (or convergence
time after a change) and stability of the overlay. PRO adopts
a conservative approach where each peer selects a new 
parent in a demand-driven fashion. This should significantly
reduce number of new parent selections, which in turn 
improves scalability (by minimizing the interference caused by
new connections) and stability of the overlay structure. A
new parent is selected in the following scenarios: (i) Initial
Phase: when a new peer joins the overlay, it periodically
adds a new parent until it has min nop parents. (ii) 
Replacing a Poorly-Performing Parent: when available 
bandwidth from an existing parent is significantly reduced for a
long time or a parent leaves the session, the receiver can
select another peer after a random delay. Each receiver 
selects a random delay proportional to its available bandwidth
from the parent peer [8]. This approach dampens potential
oscillation in the overlay while increasing the chance for 
receivers with higher bandwidth connectivity to keep a parent
(i.e., properly reshapes the overlay). (iii) Improvement in
Performance: when it is likely that a new parent would 
significantly improve a non-optimized aspect of performance
(increase the bandwidth or decrease the delay). This 
strategy allows gradual improvement of the parent subset as new
peers are discovered (or joined) the overlay. The available
information for each peer in the image is used as a heuristic
to predict performance of a new peer. Such an improvement
should be examined infrequently. A hysteresis mechanism

is implemented in scenario (ii) and (iii) to dampen any 
potential oscillation in the overlay.
2) Which peer should be selected as a new parent?
At any point of time, peers in the local image are the best
known candidate peers to serve as parent. In PRO, each
receiver randomly selects a parent from its current image
where the probability of selecting a parent is proportional
to its utility. Deploying this selection strategy by all peers
lead to proportional utilization of outgoing bandwidth of all
peers without making the selection heavily biased towards
high bandwidth peers. This approach (similar to [5]) 
leverages heterogeneity among peers since number of children for
each peer is proportional to its outgoing bandwidth.
3) How should a new parent be examined?
Each receiver continuously monitors available bandwidth
from all parents and potential correlation between 
bandwidth of two or more connections as signal for shared 
bottleneck. The degree of such correlation also reveals the level
of multiplexing at the bottleneck link, and could serve as
an indicator for separating remote bottlenecks from a local
one. Such a monitoring should use average bandwidth of
each flow over a relatively long time scale (e.g., hundreds
of RTT) to filter out any transient variations in bandwidth.
To avoid selecting a poorly-performing parent in the near
future, the receiver associates a timer to each parent and
exponentially backs off the timer after each failed 
experience [13].
After the initial phase, each receiver maintains a fixed
number of parents at any point of time (nopi(t)). Thus, a
new parent should replace one of the active parents. 
However, to ensure monotonic improvement in overall 
performance of active parents, a new parent is always added 
before one of the existing parents is dropped (i.e., a receiver
can temporarily have one extra parent). Given the 
available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one)
and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one
of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize
the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that 
contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path 
diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should
drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck
with the largest number of active parents and contributes
minimum bandwidth among them. Finally, if the 
aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required
bandwidth after examining certain number of new parents
(and nopi(t) < max nop), the receiver can increase the total
number of parents by one.
