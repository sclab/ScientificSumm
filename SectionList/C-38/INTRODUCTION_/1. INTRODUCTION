Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new
distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay
networks where a group of participating end-systems (or
peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in
distribution of content without any special support from the
network (e.g., [7]). Since overlay structures are layered over
the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing 
overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i)
Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii) 
Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation
to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv) 
Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity
among participating peers[19]. Coping with bandwidth 
variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly 
important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming 
applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly
determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s)
on) the overlay.
This paper presents a simple framework for architecting
Peer-to-peer Receiver-driven Overlay, called PRO. PRO can
accommodate a spectrum of non-interactive streaming 
applications ranging from playback to lecture-mode live 
sessions. The main design philosophy in PRO is that each
peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly 
determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to
maximize its own delivered quality. Toward this end, each
peer can connect to the overlay topology at multiple points
(i.e., receive content through multiple parent peers). 
Therefore, participating peers form an unstructured overlay that
can gracefully cope with high churn rate[5]. Furthermore,
having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth 
heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against
dynamics of peer participation.
PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based
Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message
(i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn
about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that
are likely to be good parents. Gossiping provides a 
scalable and efficient approach to peer discovery in unstructured
peer-to-peer networks that can be customized to guide 
direction of discovery towards peers with desired properties
(e.g., peers with shorter distance or higher bandwidth). (ii)
Receiver-driven Parent Selection: Given the collected 
information about other participating peers by gossiping 
mechanism, each peer (or receiver) gradually improves its own
delivered quality by dynamically selecting a proper subset
of parent peers that collectively maximize provided 
bandwidth to the receiver. Since the available bandwidth from
different participating peers to a receiver (and possible 
correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a
receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize
available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers. Furthermore,
the available bandwidth from parent peers serves as an 
implicit signal for a receiver to detect and react to changes
in network or overlay condition without any explicit 
coordination with other participating peers. Independent parent
selection by individual peers leads to an efficient overlay that
maximizes delivered quality to each peer. PRO incorporates
42
several damping functions to ensure stability of the overlay
despite uncoordinated actions by different peers.
PRO is part of a larger architecture that we have 
developed for peer-to-peer streaming. In our earlier work, we
developed a mechanism called PALS [18] that enables a 
receiver to stream layered structured content from a given
set of congestion controlled senders. Thus, PRO and PALS
are both receiver-driven but complement each other. More
specifically, PRO determines a proper subset of parent peers
that collectively maximize delivered bandwidth to each 
receiver whereas PALS coordinates in-time streaming of 
different segments of multimedia content from these parents
despite unpredictable variations in their available bandwidth.
This division of functionality provides a great deal of 
flexibility because it decouples overlay construction from delivery
mechanism. In this paper, we primarily focus on the overlay
construction mechanism, or PRO.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
2, we revisit the problem of overlay construction for 
peerto-peer streaming and identify its two key components and
explore their design space. We illustrate the differences 
between PRO and previous solutions, and justify our design
choices. We present our proposed framework in Section 3.
In Sections 4 and 5, the key components of our framework
are described in further detail. Finally, Section 6 concludes
the paper and presents our future plans.
