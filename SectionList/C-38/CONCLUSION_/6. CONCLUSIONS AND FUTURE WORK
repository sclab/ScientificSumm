In this paper, we presented a simple receiver-driven 
framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called
PRO. PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently
determine the best way to connect to the overlay to 
maximize its performance. Therefore, PRO should be able to
maximize delivered quality to peers with heterogeneous and
asymmetric bandwidth connectivity. Both peer discovery
and peer selection in this framework are scalable. 
Furthermore, PRO uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an
implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing
parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions
to properly reshape the structure. We described the basic
framework and its key components, and sketched our 
strawman solutions.
This is a starting point for our work on PRO. We are
currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via
simulation, and exploring the design space of key 
components. We are also prototyping this framework to conduct
real-world experiments on the Planet-Lab in a near future.
