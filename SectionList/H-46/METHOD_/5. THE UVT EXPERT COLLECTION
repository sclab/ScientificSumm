The UvT Expert collection used in the experiments in this paper
fits the scenario outlined in Section 3. The collection is based on
the Webwijs (Webwise) system developed at Tilburg University
(UvT) in the Netherlands. Webwijs (http://www.uvt.nl/
webwijs/) is a publicly accessible database of UvT employees
who are involved in research or teaching; currently, Webwijs 
contains information about 1168 experts, each of whom has a page with
contact information and, if made available by the expert, a research
description and publications list. In addition, each expert can 
select expertise areas from a list of 1491 topics and is encouraged to
suggest new topics that need to be approved by the Webwijs editor.
Each topic has a separate page that shows all experts associated
with that topic and, if available, a list of related topics.
Webwijs is available in Dutch and English, and this bilinguality
has been preserved in the collection. Every Dutch Webwijs page
has an English translation. Not all Dutch topics have an English
translation, but the reverse is true: the 981 English topics all have a
Dutch equivalent.
About 42% of the experts teach courses at Tilburg University;
these courses were also crawled and included in the profile. In 
addition, about 27% of the experts link to their academic homepage
from their Webwijs page. These home pages were crawled and
added to the collection. (This means that if experts put the full-text
versions of their publications on their academic homepage, these
were also available for indexing.) We also obtained 1880 full-text
versions of publications from the UvT institutional repository and

converted them to plain text. We ran the TextCat [23] language
identifier to classify the language of the home pages and the 
fulltext publications. We restricted ourselves to pages where the 
classifier was confident about the language used on the page.
This resulted in four document types: research descriptions (RD),
course descriptions (CD), publications (PUB; full-text and 
citationonly versions), and academic homepages (HP). Everything was
bundled into the UvT Expert collection which is available at http:
//ilk.uvt.nl/uvt-expert-collection/.
The UvT Expert collection was extracted from a different 
organizational setting than the W3C collection and differs from it in
a number of ways. The UvT setting is one with relatively small
amounts of multilingual data. Document-author associations are
clear and the data is structured and clean. The collection covers a
broad range of expertise areas, as one can typically find on intranets
of universities and other knowledge-intensive institutes. 
Additionally, our university setting features several types of structure 
(topical and organizational), as well as multiple document types. 
Another important difference between the two data sets is that the 
expertise areas in the UvT Expert collection are self-selected instead
of being based on group membership or assignments by others.
Size is another dimension along which the W3C and UvT Expert
collections differ: the latter is the smaller of the two. Also realistic
are the large differences in the amount of information available for
each expert. Utilizing Webwijs is voluntary; 425 Dutch experts
did not select any topics at all. This leaves us with 743 Dutch and
727 English usable expert profiles. Table 2 provides descriptive
statistics for the UvT Expert collection.
Universities tend to have a hierarchical structure that goes from
the faculty level, to departments, research groups, down to the 
individual researchers. In the UvT Expert collection we have 
information about the affiliations of researchers with faculties and
institutes, providing us with a two-level organizational hierarchy.
Tilburg University has 22 organizational units at the faculty level
(including the university office and several research institutes) and
71 departments, which amounts to 3.2 departments per faculty.
As to the topical hierarchy used by Webwijs, 131 of the 1491
topics are top nodes in the hierarchy. This hierarchy has an average
topic chain length of 2.65 and a maximum length of 7 topics.
