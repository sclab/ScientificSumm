An organization"s intranet provides a means for exchanging 
information between employees and for facilitating employee 
collaborations. To efficiently and effectively achieve this, it is necessary
to provide search facilities that enable employees not only to access
documents, but also to identify expert colleagues.
At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and 
understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the 
introduction of Expert Finding tasks. The goal of expert finding is to
identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.
This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between
people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name
of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be 
evidence of expertise. An alternative task, which using the same idea
of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to
return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3].
The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a
lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made
in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects. However,
nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has
been validated experimentally using the W3C collection [24] from
the Enterprise Track. While this collection is currently the only
publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only
represents one type of intranet. With only one test collection it is
not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings.
In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting
that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small
amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad
range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of 
universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations. Typically, this
setting features several additional types of structure: topical 
structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), 
organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple
types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications,
and academic homepages). This setting is quite different from the
W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of
expertise retrieval tasks.
We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does
the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect
the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of
expertise retrieval algorithms? How do state-of-the-art algorithms
developed on the W3C data set perform in the alternative scenario
of the type described above? More generally, do the lessons from
the Expert Finding task at TREC carry over to this setting? How
does the inclusion or exclusion of different documents affect 
expertise retrieval tasks? In addition to, how can the topical and 
organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes?
To answer our research questions, we first present a set of 
baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at
finding associations between topics and people. This allows us to
formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform
way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the 
relations between the two tasks. For our experimental evaluation, we
introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is 
representative of the type of intranet that we described above. Our 
collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the 
website of Tilburg University (UvT). This type of data is particularly
interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and 
focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains
information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual 
(English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual
are provided by the employees themselves. Using the UvT Expert
collection, we conduct two sets of experiments. The first is aimed
at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and
profiling methods in this new setting. A second group of 
experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit
characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically,
we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling 
methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure.
Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute,
our main contributions are as follows. The baseline models 
developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set. While
on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more 
difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case. We
find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more 
difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large
(but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling:
about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case. 
Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly 
improve retrieval performance. The best performing similarity 
measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C
(and other) settings as well. Finally, we demonstrate that the 
organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model,
improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next
section we review related work. Then, in Section 3 we provide 
detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address
in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling. In Section 4 we
present our baseline models, of which the performance is then 
assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in 
Section 5. Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are
presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8. We formulate our
conclusions in Section 9.
