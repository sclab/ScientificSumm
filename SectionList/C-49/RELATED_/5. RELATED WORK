In addition to the protocols that we evaluated in our simulation,
several other opportunistic network routing protocols have been
proposed in the literature. We did not implement and evaluate these
routing protocols, because either they require domain-specific 
information (location information) [14, 15], assume certain mobility
patterns [17], present orthogonal approaches [10, 24] to other 
routing protocols.

LeBrun et al. [14] propose a location-based delay-tolerant 
network routing protocol. Their algorithm assumes that every node
knows its own position, and the destination is stationary at a known
location. A node forwards data to a neighbor only if the 
neighbor is closer to the destination than its own position. Our protocol
does not require knowledge of the nodes" locations, and learns their
contact patterns.
Leguay et al. [15] use a high-dimensional space to represent a
mobility pattern, then routes messages to nodes that are closer to
the destination node in the mobility pattern space. Location 
information of nodes is required to construct mobility patterns.
Musolesi et al. [17] propose an adaptive routing protocol for 
intermittently connected mobile ad-hoc networks. They use a Kalman
filter to compute the probability that a node delivers messages. This
protocol assumes group mobility and cloud connectivity, that is,
nodes move as a group, and among this group of nodes a 
contemporaneous end-to-end connection exists for every pair of nodes. When
two nodes are in the same connected cloud, DSDV [19] routing is
used.
Network coding also draws much interest from DTN research.
Erasure-coding [10, 24] explores coding algorithms to reduce 
message replicas. The source node replicates a message m times, then
uses a coding scheme to encode them in one big message. 
After replicas are encoded, the source divides the big message into k

blocks of the same size, and transmits a block to each of the first k
encountered nodes. If m of the blocks are received at the 
destination, the message can be restored, where m < k. In a uniformly
distributed mobility scenario, the delivery probability increases 
because the probability that the destination node meets m relays is
greater than it meets k relays, given m < k.
