This paper has studied bilateral multi-issue negotiation between
self-interested autonomous agents with time constraints. The issues
are indivisible and different agents value different issues 
differently. Thus, the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate
the issues between themselves so as to maximize their individual
utilities. Specifically, we first showed that finding the equilibrium
offers is an NP-hard problem even in a complete information 
setting. We then presented approximately optimal negotiation 
strategies and showed that they form an equilibrium. These strategies
have polynomial time complexity. We also analysed the difference
between the true optimum and the approximate optimum. Finally,
we extended the analysis to online negotiation where the issues 
become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain
about the features of these issues. Specifically, we showed that an
approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and analysed
the approximation error. These approximate strategies also have
polynomial time complexity.
There are several interesting directions for future work. First,
for online negotiation, we assumed that the constants ka
c and kb
c are
both uniformly distributed. It will be interesting to analyze the case
where ka
c and kb
c have other, possibly different, probability 
distributions. Apart from this, we treated the number of issues as being
common knowledge to the agents. In future, it will be interesting
to treat the number of issues as uncertain.
