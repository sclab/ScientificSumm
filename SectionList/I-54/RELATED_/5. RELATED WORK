Work on multi-issue negotiation can be divided into two main types:
that for indivisible issues and that for divisible issues. We first
describe the existing work for the case of divisible issues. Since
Schelling [24] first noted that the outcome of negotiation depends
on the choice of negotiation procedure, much research effort has
been devoted to the study of different procedures for negotiating
multiple issues. However, most of this work has focussed on the 
sequential procedure [7, 2]. For this procedure, a key issue is the 
negotiation agenda. Here the term agenda refers to the order in which
the issues are negotiated. The agenda is important because each
agent"s cumulative utility depends on the agenda; if we change the
agenda then these utilities change. Hence, the agents must decide
what agenda they will use. Now, the agenda can be decided before
negotiating the issues (such an agenda is called exogenous) or it
may be decided during the process of negotiation (such an agenda
is called endogenous). For instance, Fershtman [7] analyze 
sequential negotiation with exogenous agenda. A number of researchers
have also studied negotiations with an endogenous agenda [2].
In contrast to the above work that mainly deals with sequential
negotiation, [6] studies the equilibrium for the package deal 
procedure. However, all the above mentioned work differs from ours in
that we focus on indivisible issues while others focus on the case
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 957
where each issue is divisible. Specifically, no previous work has
determined an approximate equilibrium for multi-issue negotiation
or for online negotiation.
Existing work for the case of indivisible issues has mostly dealt
with task allocation problems (for tasks that cannot be partioned)
to a group of agents. The problem of task allocation has been 
previously studied in the context of coalitions involving more than
two agents. For example [25] analyze the problem for the case
where the agents act so as to maximize the benefit of the system
as a whole. In contrast, our focus is on two agents where both of
them are self-interested and want to maximize their individual 
utilities. On the other hand [22] focus on the use of contracts for task
allocation to multiple self interested agents but this work concerns
finding ways of decommitting contracts (after the initial allocation
has been done) so as to improve an agent"s utility. In contrast, our
focuses on negotiation regarding who will carry out which task.
Finally, online and approximate mechanisms have been studied
in the context of auctions [14, 9] but not for bilateral negotiations
(which is the focus of our work).
