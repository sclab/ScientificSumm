We adopt the single issue model of [27] because this is a model
where, during negotiation, the parties are allowed to make offers
from a set of discrete offers. Since our focus is on indivisible issues
(i.e., parties are allowed to make one of two possible offers: zero
or one), our scenario fits in well with [27]. Hence we use this basic
single issue model and extend it to multiple issues. Before doing
so, we give an overview of this model and its equilibrium strategies.
There are two strategic agents: a and b. Each agent has time
constraints in the form of deadlines and discount factors. The two
agents negotiate over a single indivisible issue (i). This issue is a
‘pie" of size 1 and the agents want to determine who gets the pie.
There is a deadline (i.e., a number of rounds by which negotiation
must end). Let n ∈ N+
denote this deadline. The agents use an
alternating offers protocol (as the one of Rubinstein [18]), which
proceeds through a series of time periods. One of the agents, say
a, starts negotiation in the first time period (i.e., t = 1) by making
an offer (xi = 0 or 1) to b. Agent b can either accept or reject the
offer. If it accepts, negotiation ends in an agreement with a getting
xi and b getting yi = 1 − xi. Otherwise, negotiation proceeds to
the next time period, in which agent b makes a counter-offer. This
process of making offers continues until one of the agents either
accepts an offer or quits negotiation (resulting in a conflict). Thus,
there are three possible actions an agent can take during any time
period: accept the last offer, make a new counter-offer, or quit the
negotiation.
An essential feature of negotiations involving alternating offers
is that the agents" utilities decrease with time [21]. Specifically,
the decrease occurs at each step of offer and counteroffer. This
decrease is represented with a discount factor denoted 0 < δi ≤ 1
for both1
agents.
Let [xt
i, yt
i ] denote the offer made at time period t where xt
i and
yt
i denote the share for agent a and b respectively. Then, for a given
pie, the set of possible offers is:
{[xt
i, yt
i ] : xt
i = 0 or 1, yt
i = 0 or 1, and xt
i + yt
i = 1}
At time t, if a and b receive a share of xt
i and yt
i respectively, then
their utilities are:
ua
i (xt
i, t) =
j
xt
i × δt−1
if t ≤ n
0 otherwise
ub
i (yt
i , t) =
j
yt
i × δt−1
if t ≤ n
0 otherwise
The conflict utility (i.e., the utility received in the event that no deal
is struck) is zero for both agents.
For the above setting, the agents reason as follows in order to
determine what to offer at t = 1. We let A(1) (B(1)) denote a"s
(b"s) equilibrium offer for the first time period. Let agent a denote
the first mover (i.e., at t = 1, a proposes to b who should get the
pie). To begin, consider the case where the deadline for both agents
is n = 1. If b accepts, the division occurs as agreed; if not, neither
agent gets anything (since n = 1 is the deadline). Here, a is in a
powerful position and is able to propose to keep 100 percent of the
pie and give nothing to b 2
. Since the deadline is n = 1, b accepts
this offer and agreement takes place in the first time period.
Now, consider the case where the deadline is n = 2. In order to
decide what to offer in the first round, a looks ahead to t = 2 and
reasons backwards. Agent a reasons that if negotiation proceeds
to the second round, b will take 100 percent of the pie by offering
[0, 1] and leave nothing for a. Thus, in the first time period, if a
offers b anything less than the whole pie, b will reject the offer.
Hence, during the first time period, agent a offers [0, 1]. Agent b
accepts this and an agreement occurs in the first time period.
In general, if the deadline is n, negotiation proceeds as follows.
As before, agent a decides what to offer in the first round by 
looking ahead as far as t = n and then reasoning backwards. Agent a"s

Having a different discount factor for different agents only makes
the presentation more involved without leading to any changes in
the analysis of the strategic behaviour of the agents or the time 
complexity of finding the equilibrium offers. Hence we have a single
discount factor for both agents.

It is possible that b may reject such a proposal. However, 
irrespective of whether b accepts or rejects the proposal, it gets zero utility
(because the deadline is n = 1). Thus, we assume that b accepts
a"s offer.

offer for t = 1 depends on who the offering agent is for the last
time period. This, in turn, depends on whether n is odd or even.
Since a makes an offer at t = 1 and the agents use the alternating
offers protocol, the offering agent for the last time period is b if n
is even and it is a if n is odd. Thus, depending on whether n is odd
or even, a makes the following offer at t = 1:
A(1) =
j
OFFER [1, 0] IF ODD n
ACCEPT IF b"s TURN
B(1) =
j
OFFER [0, 1] IF EVEN n
ACCEPT IF a"s TURN
Agent b accepts this offer and negotiation ends in the first time
period. Note that the equilibrium outcome depends on who makes
the first move. Since we have two agents and either of them could
move first, we get two possible equilibrium outcomes.
On the basis of the above equilibrium for single-issue 
negotiation with complete information, we first obtain the equilibrium for
multiple issues and then show that computing these offers is a hard
problem. We then present a time efficient approximate equilibrium.
