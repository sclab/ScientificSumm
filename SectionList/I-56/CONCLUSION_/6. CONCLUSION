Applying automated negotiation to DCSP, this paper has 
proposed a protocol that prescribes the generic reasoning of a DCSP
agent in a BDI architecture. Our work shows that several 
wellknown DCSP algorithms, namely ABT, AWC and DBO, can be
described as mechanisms sharing the same proposed protocol, and
only differ in the strategies employed for the reasoning steps per
negotiation round as governed by the protocol. Importantly, this
means that it might furnish a unified framework for DCSP that
not only provides a clearer BDI agent-theoretic view of existing
DCSP approaches, but also opens up the opportunities to enhance
or develop new strategies. Towards the latter, we have proposed
and formulated a new strategy - the UMA strategy. Empirical
results and our discussion suggest that UMA is superior to ABT,
AWC and DBO in some specific aspects.
It was observed from our simulations that UMA possesses the
completeness property. Future work will attempt to formally 
establish this property, as well as formalize other existing DSCP
algorithms as BDI negotiation mechanisms, including the recent
endeavor that employs a group mediator [5]. The idea of DCSP
agents using different strategies in the same environment will also
be investigated.
