The BDI model originates with the work of M. Bratman [11].
According to [12, Ch.1], the BDI architecture is based on a 
philosophical model of human practical reasoning, and draws out the
process of reasoning by which an agent decides which actions to
perform at consecutive moments when pursuing certain goals.
Grounding the scope to the DCSP framework, the common goal
of all agents is finding a combination of domain values to satisfy a
set of predefined constraints. In automated negotiation [9], such
a solution is called an agreement among the agents. Within this
scope, we found that we were able to unearth the generic behavior
of a DCSP agent and formulate it in a negotiation protocol, 
prescribed using the powerful concepts of BDI. Thus, our proposed
negotiation model can be said to combine the BDI concepts with
automated negotiation in a multiagent framework, allowing us
to conceptually separate DCSP mechanisms into a common BDI
interaction protocol and the adopted strategies.

on the adopted strategy.
Two types of messages are exchanged through this protocol,
namely, the info message and the negotiation message.
An info message perceived is a message sent by another agent.
The message will contain the current selected values and priorities
of the variables of that sending agent. The main purpose of this
message is to update the agent about the current environment.
Info message is sent out at the end of one negotiation round (also
called a negotiation cycle), and received at the beginning of next
round.
A negotiation message is a message which may be sent within
a round. This message is for mediation purposes. The agent may
put different contents into this type of message as long as it is
agreed among the group. The format of the negotiation message
and when it is to be sent out are subject to the strategy. A
negotiation message can be sent out at the end of one reasoning
step and received at the beginning of the next step.
Mediation is a step of the protocol that depends on whether the
agent"s interaction with others is synchronous or asynchronous.
In synchronous mechanism, mediation is required in every 
negotiation round. In an asynchronous one, mediation is needed only in
a negotiation round when the agent receives a negotiation 
message. A more in-depth view of this mediation step is provided
later in this section.
The BDI protocol prescribes the skeletal structure for DCSP
negotiation. We will show in Section 4 that several well-known
DCSP mechanisms all inherit this generic model.
The details of the six main reasoning steps for the protocol
(see Figure 1) are described as follows for a DCSP agent. For a
conceptually clearer description, we assume that there is only one
variable per agent.
• Percept. In this step, the agent receives info messages
from its neighbors in the environment, and using its Percept
function, returns an image P. This image contains the
current values assigned to the variables of all agents in its
neighbor list. The image P will drive the agent"s actions
in subsequent steps. The agent also updates its constraint
list C using some criteria of the adopted strategy.
• Belief. Using the image P and constraint list C, the agent
will check if there is any violated constraint. If there is
no violation, the agent will believe it is choosing a correct
option and therefore will take no action. The agent will
do nothing if it is in a local stable state - a snapshot of
the variables assignments of the agent and all its neighbors
by which they satisfy their shared constraints. When all
agents are in their local stable states, the whole 
environment is said to be in a global stable state and an

ment is found. In case the agent finds its value in conflict
with some of its neighbors", i.e., the combination of values
assigned to the variables leads to a constraint violation,
the agent will first try to reassign its own variable using a
specific strategy. If it finds a suitable option which meets
some criteria of the adopted strategy, the agent will believe
it should change to the new option. However it does not
always happen that an agent can successfully find such an
option. If no option can be found, the agent will believe it
has no option, and therefore will request its neighbors to
reconsider their variable assignments.
To summarize, there are three types of beliefs that a DCSP
agent can form: (i) it can change its variable assignment to
improve the current situation, (ii) it cannot change its 
variable assignment and some constraints violations cannot be
resolved and (iii) it need not change its variable assignment
as all the constraints are satisfied.
Once the beliefs are formed, the agent will determine its
desires, which are the options that attempt to resolve the
current constraint violations.
• Desire. If the agent takes Belief (i), it will generate a list of
its own suitable domain values as its desire set. If the agent
takes Belief (ii), it cannot ascertain its desire set, but will
generate a sublist of agents from its neighbor list, whom it
will ask to reconsider their variable assignments. How this
sublist is created depends on the strategy devised for the
agent. In this situation, the agent will use a virtual desire
set that it determines based on its adopted strategy. If the
agent takes Belief (iii), it will have no desire to revise its
domain value, and hence no intention.
• Intention. The agent will select a value from its desire
set as its intention. An intention is the best desired 
option that the agent assigns to its variable. The criteria for
selecting a desire as the agent"s intention depend on the
strategy used. Once the intention is formed, the agent may
either proceed to the execution step, or undergo mediation.
Again, the decision to do so is determined by some criteria
of the adopted strategy.
• Mediation. This is an important function of the agent.
Since, if the agent executes its intention without 
performing intention mediation with its neighbors, the constraint
violation between the agents may not be resolved. Take
for example, suppose two agents have variables, x1 and x2,
associated with the same domain {1, 2}, and their shared
constraint is (x1 + x2 = 3). Then if both the variables are
initialized with value 1, they will both concurrently switch
between the values 2 and 1 in the absence of mediation
between them.
There are two types of mediation: local mediation and
group mediation. In the former, the agents exchange their
intentions. When an agent receives another"s intention
which conflicts with its own, the agent must mediate 
between the intentions, by either changing its own intention
or informing the other agent to change its intention. In the
latter, there is an agent which acts as a group mediator.
This mediator will collect the intentions from the group - a
union of the agent and its neighbors - and determine which
intention is to be executed. The result of this mediation is
passed back to the agents in the group. Following 
mediation, the agent may proceed to the next reasoning step to
execute its intention or begin a new negotiation round.
• Execution. This is the last step of a negotiation round.
The agent will execute by updating its variable assignment
if the intention obtained at this step is its own. Following
execution, the agent will inform its neighbors about its new
variable assignment and updated priority. To do so, the
agent will send out an info message.
3.2 The strategy
A strategy plays an important role in the negotiation process.

search process in terms of computational cycles and message

The design space when devising a strategy is influenced by the
following dimensions: (i) asynchronous or synchronous, (ii) 
dynamic or static priority, (iii) dynamic or static constraint weight,
(iv) number of negotiation messages to be communicated, (v) the
negotiation message format and (vi) the completeness property.
In other words, these dimensions provide technical considerations
for a strategy design.
