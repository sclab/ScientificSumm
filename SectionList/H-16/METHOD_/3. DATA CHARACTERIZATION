Our data consists of a crawl of documents from the UK
domain, and query logs of one year of queries submitted to
http://www.yahoo.co.uk from November 2005 to November
2006. In our logs, 50% of the total volume of queries are
unique. The average query length is 2.5 terms, with the
longest query having 731 terms.

and query terms (middle curve). The x-axis represents the
normalized frequency rank of the query or term. (The most
frequent query appears closest to the y-axis.) The y-axis is

the normalized frequency for a given query (or term). As 
expected, the distribution of query frequencies and query term
frequencies follow power law distributions, with slope of 1.84
and 2.26, respectively. In this figure, the query frequencies
were computed as they appear in the logs with no 
normalization for case or white space. The query terms (middle
curve) have been normalized for case, as have the terms in
the document collection.
The document collection that we use for our experiments
is a summary of the UK domain crawled in May 2006.1
This
summary corresponds to a maximum of 400 crawled 
documents per host, using a breadth first crawling strategy, 
comprising 15GB. The distribution of document frequencies of
terms in the collection follows a power law distribution with
slope 2.38 (upper curve in Figure 2). The statistics of the
collection are shown in Table 1. We measured the correlation
between the document frequency of terms in the collection
and the number of queries that contain a particular term in
the query log to be 0.424. A scatter plot for a random 
sample of terms is shown in Figure 3. In this experiment, terms
have been converted to lower case in both the queries and
the documents so that the frequencies will be comparable.
