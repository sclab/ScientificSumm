Bullet is an efficient data distribution system for 
bandwidth intensive applications. While many current overlay
network distribution algorithms use a distribution tree to
deliver data from the tree"s root to all other nodes, 
Bullet layers a mesh on top of an original overlay tree to 
increase overall bandwidth to all nodes in the tree. Hence,
each node receives a parent stream from its parent in the
tree and some number of perpendicular streams from chosen
peers in the overlay. This has significant bandwidth impact
when a single node in the overlay is unable to deliver 
adequate bandwidth to a receiving node.
Bullet requires an underlying overlay tree for RanSub to
deliver random subsets of participants"s state to nodes in
the overlay, informing them of a set of nodes that may be
good candidates for retrieving data not available from any
of the node"s current peers and parent. While we also use
the underlying tree for baseline streaming, this is not critical
to Bullet"s ability to efficiently deliver data to nodes in the
overlay. As a result, Bullet is capable of functioning on
top of essentially any overlay tree. In our experiments, we
have run Bullet over random and bandwidth-optimized trees
created oﬄine (with global topological knowledge). Bullet
registers itself with the underlying overlay tree so that it is
informed when the overlay changes as nodes come and go or
make performance transformations in the overlay.
As with streaming overlays trees, Bullet can use standard
transports such as TCP and UDP as well as our 
implementation of TFRC. For the remainder of this paper, we assume
the use of TFRC since we primarily target streaming 
highbandwidth content and we do not require reliable or in-order
delivery. For simplicity, we assume that packets originate at
the root of the tree and are tagged with increasing sequence
numbers. Each node receiving a packet will optionally 
forward it to each of its children, depending on a number of
factors relating to the child"s bandwidth and its relative 
position in the tree.
3.1 Finding Overlay Peers
RanSub periodically delivers subsets of uniformly random
selected nodes to each participant in the overlay. Bullet 
receivers use these lists to locate remote peers able to transmit
missing data items with good bandwidth. RanSub messages
contain a set of summary tickets that include a small (120
286
bytes) summary of the data that each node contains. 
RanSub delivers subsets of these summary tickets to nodes every
configurable epoch (5 seconds by default). Each node in the
tree maintains a working set of the packets it has received
thus far, indexed by sequence numbers. Nodes associate
each working set with a Bloom filter that maintains a 
summary of the packets received thus far. Since the Bloom filter
does not exceed a specific size (m) and we would like to limit
the rate of false positives, Bullet periodically cleans up the
Bloom filter by removing lower sequence numbers from it.
This allows us to keep the Bloom filter population n from
growing at an unbounded rate. The net effect is that a
node will attempt to recover packets for a finite amount of
time depending on the packet arrival rate. Similarly, Bullet
removes older items that are not needed for data 
reconstruction from its working set and summary ticket.
We use the collect and distribute phases of RanSub to
carry Bullet summary tickets up and down the tree. In our
current implementation, we use a set size of 10 summary
tickets, allowing each collect and distribute to fit well within
the size of a non-fragmented IP packet. Though Bullet 
supports larger set sizes, we expect this parameter to be tunable
to specific applications" needs. In practice, our default size
of 10 yields favorable results for a variety of overlays and
network topologies. In essence, during an epoch a node 
receives a summarized partial view of the system"s state at
that time. Upon receiving a random subset each epoch, a
Bullet node may choose to peer with the node having the
lowest similarity ratio when compared to its own summary
ticket. This is done only when the node has sufficient space
in its sender list to accept another sender (senders with 
lackluster performance are removed from the current sender list
as described in section 3.4). Once a node has chosen the
best node it sends it a peering request containing the 
requesting node"s Bloom filter. Such a request is accepted by
the potential sender if it has sufficient space in its receiver
list for the incoming receiver. Otherwise, the send request
is rejected (space is periodically created in the receiver lists
as further described in section 3.4).
3.2 Recovering Data From Peers
Assuming it has space for the new peer, a recipient of the
peering request installs the received Bloom filter and will
periodically transmit keys not present in the Bloom filter
to the requesting node. The requesting node will refresh its
installed Bloom filters at each of its sending peers 
periodically. Along with the fresh filter, a receiving node will also
assign a portion of the sequence space to each of its senders.
In this way, a node is able the reduce the likelihood that two
peers simultaneously transmit the same key to it, wasting
network resources. A node divides the sequence space in its
current working set among each of its senders uniformly.
As illustrated in Figure 4, a Bullet receiver views the data
space as a matrix of packet sequences containing s rows,
where s is its current number of sending peers. A receiver 
periodically (every 5 seconds by default) updates each sender
with its current Bloom filter and the range of sequences 
covered in its Bloom filter. This identifies the range of packets
that the receiver is currently interested in recovering. Over
time, this range shifts as depicted in Figure 4-b). In 
addition, the receiving node assigns to each sender a row from
the matrix, labeled mod. A sender will forward packets to

the receiver that have a sequence number x such that x
modulo s equals the mod number. In this fashion, receivers
register to receive disjoint data from their sending peers.
By specifying ranges and matrix rows, a receiver is 
unlikely to receive duplicate data items, which would result in
wasted bandwidth. A duplicate packet, however, may be 
received when a parent recovers a packet from one of its peers
and relays the packet to its children (and descendants). In
this case, a descendant would receive the packet out of order
and may have already recovered it from one of its peers. In
practice, this wasteful reception of duplicate packets is 
tolerable; less than 10% of all received packets are duplicates
in our experiments.
3.3 Making Data Disjoint
We now provide details of Bullet"s mechanisms to increase
the ease by which nodes can find disjoint data not provided
by parents. We operate on the premise that the main 
challenge in recovering lost data packets transmitted over an
overlay distribution tree lies in finding the peer node 
housing the data to recover. Many systems take a 
hierarchical approach to this problem, propagating repair requests
up the distribution tree until the request can be satisfied.
This ultimately leads to scalability issues at higher levels in
the hierarchy particularly when overlay links are 
bandwidthconstrained.
On the other hand, Bullet attempts to recover lost data
from any non-descendant node, not just ancestors, thereby
increasing overall system scalability. In traditional overlay
distribution trees, packets are lost by the transmission 
transport and/or the network. Nodes attempt to stream data as
fast as possible to each child and have essentially no control
over which portions of the data stream are dropped by the
transport or network. As a result, the streaming 
subsystem has no control over how many nodes in the system will
ultimately receive a particular portion of the data. If few
nodes receive a particular range of packets, recovering these
pieces of data becomes more difficult, requiring increased
communication costs, and leading to scalability problems.
In contrast, Bullet nodes are aware of the bandwidth 
achievable to each of its children using the underlying transport. If
287
a child is unable to receive the streaming rate that the 
parent receives, the parent consciously decides which portion of
the data stream to forward to the constrained child. In 
addition, because nodes recover data from participants chosen
uniformly at random from the set of non-descendants, it is
advantageous to make each transmitted packet recoverable
from approximately the same number of participant nodes.
That is, given a randomly chosen subset of peer nodes, it is
with the same probability that each node has a particular
data packet. While not explicitly proven here, we believe
that this approach maximizes the probability that a lost
data packet can be recovered, regardless of which packet is
lost. To this end, Bullet distributes incoming packets among
one or more children in hopes that the expected number of
nodes receiving each packet is approximately the same.
A node p maintains for each child, i, a limiting and sending
factor, lfi and sfi. These factors determine the proportion
of p"s received data rate that it will forward to each child.
The sending factor sfi is the portion of the parent stream
(rate) that each child should own based on the number
of descendants the child has. The more descendants a child
has, the larger the portion of received data it should own.
The limiting factor lfi represents the proportion of the 
parent rate beyond the sending factor that each child can 
handle. For example, a child with one descendant, but high
bandwidth would have a low sending factor, but a very high
limiting factor. Though the child is responsible for owning
a small portion of the received data, it actually can receive
a large portion of it.
Because RanSub collects descendant counts di for each
child i, Bullet simply makes a call into RanSub when sending
data to determine the current sending factors of its children.
For each child i out of k total, we set the sending factor to
be:
sfi = diÈk
j=1 dj
.
In addition, a node tracks the data successfully 
transmitted via the transport. That is, Bullet data transport 
sockets are non-blocking; successful transmissions are send 
attempts that are accepted by the non-blocking transport. If
the transport would block on a send (i.e., transmission of the
packet would exceed the TCP-friendly fair share of network
resources), the send fails and is counted as an unsuccessful
send attempt. When a data packet is received by a parent,
it calculates the proportion of the total data stream that
has been sent to each child, thus far, in this epoch. It then
assigns ownership of the current packet to the child with
sending proportion farthest away from its sfi as illustrated
in Figure 5.
Having chosen the target of a particular packet, the parent
attempts to forward the packet to the child. If the send is
not successful, the node must find an alternate child to own
the packet. This occurs when a child"s bandwidth is not 
adequate to fulfill its responsibilities based on its descendants
(sfi). To compensate, the node attempts to 
deterministically find a child that can own the packet (as evidenced by
its transport accepting the packet). The net result is that
children with more than adequate bandwidth will own more
of their share of packets than those with inadequate 
bandwidth. In the event that no child can accept a packet, it
must be dropped, corresponding to the case where the sum
of all children bandwidths is inadequate to serve the received
foreach child in children {
if ( (child->sent / total_sent)
< child->sending_factor)
target_child = child;
}
if (!senddata( target_child->addr,

// send succeeded
target_child->sent++;
target_child->child_filter.insert(got_key);
sent_packet = 1;
}
foreach child in children {
should_send = 0;
if (!sent_packet) // transfer ownership
should_send = 1;
else // test for available bandwidth
if ( key % (1.0/child->limiting_factor) == 0 )
should_send = 1;
if (should_send) {
if (!senddata( child->addr,
msg, size, key)) {
if (!sent_packet) // i received ownership
child->sent++;
else
increase(child->limiting_factor);
child->child_filter.insert(got_key);
sent_packet = 1;
}
else // send failed
if (sent_packet) // was for extra bw
decrease(child->limiting_factor);
}
}
Figure 5: Pseudo code for Bullet"s disjoint data send
routine
stream. While making data more difficult to recover, Bullet
still allows for recovery of such data to its children. The
sending node will cache the data packet and serve it to its
requesting peers. This process allows its children to 
potentially recover the packet from one of their own peers, to
whom additional bandwidth may be available.
Once a packet has been successfully sent to the owning
child, the node attempts to send the packet to all other
children depending on the limiting factors lfi. For each child
i, a node attempts to forward the packet deterministically if
the packet"s sequence modulo 1/lfi is zero. Essentially, this
identifies which lfi fraction of packets of the received data
stream should be forwarded to each child to make use of the
available bandwidth to each. If the packet transmission is
successful, lfi is increased such that one more packet is to
be sent per epoch. If the transmission fails, lfi is decreased
by the same amount. This allows children limiting factors
to be continuously adjusted in response to changing network
conditions.
It is important to realize that by maintaining limiting 
factors, we are essentially using feedback from children (by 
observing transport behavior) to determine the best data to
stop sending during times when a child cannot handle the
entire parent stream. In one extreme, if the sum of 
children bandwidths is not enough to receive the entire parent
stream, each child will receive a completely disjoint data
stream of packets it owns. In the other extreme, if each
288
child has ample bandwidth, it will receive the entire parent
stream as each lfi would settle on 1.0. In the general case,
our owning strategy attempts to make data disjoint among
children subtrees with the guiding premise that, as much as
possible, the expected number of nodes receiving a packet is
the same across all packets.
3.4 Improving the Bullet Mesh
Bullet allows a maximum number of peering relationships.
That is, a node can have up to a certain number of receivers
and a certain number of senders (each defaults to 10 in our
implementation). A number of considerations can make the
current peering relationships sub-optimal at any given time:
i) the probabilistic nature of RanSub means that a node may
not have been exposed to a sufficiently appropriate peer, ii)
receivers greedily choose peers, and iii) network conditions
are constantly changing. For example, a sender node may
wind up being unable to provide a node with very much
useful (non-duplicate) data. In such a case, it would be
advantageous to remove that sender as a peer and find some
other peer that offers better utility.
Each node periodically (every few RanSub epochs) 
evaluates the bandwidth performance it is receiving from its
sending peers. A node will drop a peer if it is sending too
many duplicate packets when compared to the total number
of packets received. This threshold is set to 50% by default.
If no such wasteful sender is found, a node will drop the
sender that is delivering the least amount of useful data to
it. It will replace this sender with some other sending peer
candidate, essentially reserving a trial slot in its sender list.
In this way, we are assured of keeping the best senders seen
so far and will eliminate senders whose performance 
deteriorates with changing network conditions.
Likewise, a Bullet sender will periodically evaluate its 
receivers. Each receiver updates senders of the total received
bandwidth. The sender, knowing the amount of data it has
sent to each receiver, can determine which receiver is 
benefiting the least by peering with this sender. This corresponds
to the one receiver acquiring the least portion of its 
bandwidth through this sender. The sender drops this receiver,
creating an empty slot for some other trial receiver. This is
similar to the concept of weans presented in [24].
