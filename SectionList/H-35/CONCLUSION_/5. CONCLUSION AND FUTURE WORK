In this paper we have proposed a novel algorithm for learning
ranking models in document retrieval, referred to as AdaRank. In
contrast to existing methods, AdaRank optimizes a loss function
that is directly defined on the performance measures. It employs
a boosting technique in ranking model learning. AdaRank offers
several advantages: ease of implementation, theoretical soundness,
efficiency in training, and high accuracy in ranking. Experimental
results based on four benchmark datasets show that AdaRank can
significantly outperform the baseline methods of BM25, Ranking
SVM, and RankBoost.

Future work includes theoretical analysis on the generalization
error and other properties of the AdaRank algorithm, and further
empirical evaluations of the algorithm including comparisons with
other algorithms that can directly optimize performance measures.
