Social choice theory centers around the general problem of
selecting a single outcome out of a set A of alternative 
outcomes based on the individual preferences of a set P of 
players. A method for aggregating player preferences to select
one outcome is called a social choice function. In this paper
we assume that the range A is finite and that each player"s
preference is expressed by a valuation function which 
assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing
the benefit the player derives from that outcome. The
ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a 
valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by
outcomes.
A major difficulty connected with social choice functions
is that players can not be required to tell the truth about
their preferences. Since each player seeks to maximize his
own benefit, he may find it in his interest to misrepresent
his valuation function. An important approach for dealing
with this problem is to augment a given social choice 
function with a payment function, which assigns to each player
a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the
individual preferences. By carefully choosing the payment
function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth.
A social choice function augmented with a payment function
is called a mechanism 1
and the mechanism is said to 
implement the social choice function. A mechanism is truthful
(or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if
each player"s best strategy, knowing the preferences of the
others, is always to declare his own true preferences. A 
social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful
if it has a truthful implementation. (The property of 
truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy
incentive compatibility). This framework leads naturally to
the question: which social choice functions are truthful?
This question is of the following general type: given a
class of functions (here, social choice functions) and a 
property that holds for some of them (here, truthfulness), 
characterize the property. The definition of the property itself
provides a characterization, so what more is needed? Here
are some useful notions of characterization:
• Recognition algorithm. Give an algorithm which, given
an appropriate representation of a function in the class,
determines whether the function has the property.
• Parametric representation. Give an explicit parametrized
family of functions and show that each function in the
1
The usual definition of mechanism is more general than this
(see [8] Chapter 23.C or [9]); the mechanisms we consider
here are usually called direct revelation mechanisms.

family has the property, and that every function with
the property is in the family.
A third notion applies in the case of hereditary properties
of functions. A function g is a subfunction of function f, or
f contains g, if g is obtained by restricting the domain of
f. A property P of functions is hereditary if it is preserved
under taking subfunctions. Truthfulness is easily seen to be
hereditary.
• Sets of obstructions. For a hereditary property P, a
function g that does not have the property is an 
obstruction to the property in the sense that any function
containing g doesn"t have the property. An obstruction
is minimal if every proper subfunction has the 
property. A set of obstructions is complete if every function
that does not have the property contains one of them
as a subfunction. The set of all functions that don"t
satisfy P is a complete (but trivial and uninteresting)
set of obstructions; one seeks a set of small (ideally,
minimal) obstructions.
We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms
for the property of truthfulness, but there are significant 
results concerning parametric representations and obstruction
characterizations of truthfulness. It turns out that the 
domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation 
matrices, is crucial. For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e.,
whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very
good characterizations of truthfulness. For general domains,
however, the picture is far from complete. Typically, the 
domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of
constraints. For example, an order constraint requires that
one specified entry in some row be larger than another in
the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower
bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to
be 0. These are all examples of linear inequality constraints
on the matrix entries.
Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mu"alem and
Nisan [6] defined a condition called weak monotonicity 
(WMON). (Independently, in the context of multi-unit 
auctions, Bikhchandani, Chatterji and Sen [3] identified the
same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal 
utilities (NDMU).) The definition of W-MON can be formulated
in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of
functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies
W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions
in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a 
necessary condition for truthfulness. Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan
[6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness
for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e.,
defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui,
Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains. The
domain constraints considered in both papers are special
cases of linear inequality constraints, and it is natural to
ask whether W-MON is sufficient for any domain defined by
such constraints. Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] conjectured
that W-MON suffices for convex domains. The main result
of this paper is an affirmative answer to this conjecture:
Theorem 1. For any social choice function having 
convex domain and finite range, weak monotonicity is necessary
and sufficient for truthfulness.
Using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms
of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a
complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within
the class of social choice functions with convex domains.
The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that
the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not
be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7.
1.1 Related Work
There is a simple and natural parametrized set of 
truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers. Roberts
[10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain, 
every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing
a parametrized representation for truthful functions with
unrestricted domain. There are many known examples of
truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine
maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]). Each of these 
examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that
there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all 
social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying
these restrictions are affine maximizers. Lavi, Mu"alem and
Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that
for order-based domains, under certain technical 
assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an
affine maximizer.
There are a number of results about truthfulness that
can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations, 
although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed.
For a player i, a set of valuation matrices is said to be
i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for
row i. Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is 
ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i. The following
easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature:
Proposition 2. The social choice function f is truthful
if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.
This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions
comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness.
This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful
functions, but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions.
Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra
[5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for 
truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle
property. This condition can be viewed as providing a 
minimal complete set of non-truthful functions. As is required
by proposition 2, each function in the set is local. 
Furthermore it is one-to-one. In particular its domain has size at
most the number of possible outcomes |A|.
As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal
non-truthful functions, this provides the optimal obstruction
characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of
all social choice functions. But by restricting attention to 
interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope
to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within
that class.
The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can
be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local
function of domain size exactly 2. Thus the results of Lavi,
Mu"alem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5]
give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within
certain subclasses of social choice functions. Theorem 1 
extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions.

1.2 Weak Monotonicity and the Nonnegative
Cycle Property
By proposition 2, a function is truthful if and only if each
of its local subfunctions is truthful. Therefore, to get a set
of obstructions for truthfulness, it suffices to obtain such a
set for local functions.
The domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that
are fixed on all rows but row i. Fix such a function f and
let D ⊆ RA
be the set of allowed choices for row i. Since
f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from D, we
can view f as a function from D to A. Therefore, f is a
social choice function having one player; we refer to such a
function as a single player function.
Associated to any single player function f with domain D
we define an edge-weighted directed graph Hf whose vertex
set is the image of f. For convenience, we assume that f
is surjective and so this image is A. For each a, b ∈ A,
x ∈ f−1
(a) there is an edge ex(a, b) from a to b with weight
x(a) − x(b). The weight of a set of edges is just the sum of
the weights of the edges. We say that f satisfies:
• the nonnegative cycle property if every directed cycle
has nonnegative weight.
• the nonnegative two-cycle property if every directed 
cycle between two vertices has nonnegative weight.
We say a local function g satisfies nonnegative cycle 
property/nonnegative two-cycle property if its associated single
player function f does.
The graph Hf has a possibly infinite number of edges
between any two vertices. We define Gf to be the 
edgeweighted directed graph with exactly one edge from a to b,
whose weight δab is the infimum (possibly −∞) of all of the
edge weights ex(a, b) for x ∈ f−1
(a). It is easy to see that Hf
has the nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle
property if and only if Gf does. Gf is called the outcome
graph of f.
The weak monotonicity property mentioned earlier can
be defined for arbitrary social choice functions by the 
condition that every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative
two-cycle property. The following result was obtained by
Rochet [11] in a slightly different form and rediscovered by
Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5]:
Lemma 3. A local social choice function is truthful if and
only if it has the nonnegative cycle property. Thus a social
choice function is truthful if and only if every local 
subfunction satisfies the nonnegative cycle property.
In light of this, theorem 1 follows from:
Theorem 4. For any surjective single player function f :
D −→ A where D is a convex subset of RA
and A is finite,
the nonnegative two-cycle property implies the nonnegative
cycle property.
This is the result we will prove.
1.3 Overview of the Proof of Theorem 4
Let D ⊆ RA
be convex and let f : D −→ A be a single
player function such that Gf has no negative two-cycles. We
want to conclude that Gf has no negative cycles. For two
vertices a, b, let δ∗
ab denote the minimum weight of any path
from a to b. Clearly δ∗
ab ≤ δab. Our proof shows that the
δ∗
-weight of every cycle is exactly 0, from which theorem 4
follows.
There seems to be no direct way to compute δ∗
and so we
proceed indirectly. Based on geometric considerations, we
identify a subset of paths in Gf called admissible paths and
a subset of admissible paths called straight paths. We prove
that for any two outcomes a, b, there is a straight path from
a to b (lemma 8 and corollary 10), and all straight paths
from a to b have the same weight, which we denote ρab
(theorem 12). We show that ρab ≤ δab (lemma 14) and that
the ρ-weight of every cycle is 0. The key step to this proof
is showing that the ρ-weight of every directed triangle is 0
(lemma 17).
It turns out that ρ is equal to δ∗
(corollary 20), although
this equality is not needed in the proof of theorem 4.
To expand on the above summary, we give the definitions
of an admissible path and a straight path. These are 
somewhat technical and rely on the geometry of f. We first
observe that, without loss of generality, we can assume that
D is (topologically) closed (section 2). In section 3, for each
a ∈ A, we enlarge the set f−1
(a) to a closed convex set
Da ⊆ D in such a way that for a, b ∈ A with a = b, Da and
Db have disjoint interiors. We define an admissible path to
be a sequence of outcomes (a1, . . . , ak) such that each of the
sets Ij = Daj ∩ Daj+1 is nonempty (section 4). An 
admissible path is straight if there is a straight line that meets one
point from each of the sets I1, . . . , Ik−1 in order (section 5).
Finally, we mention how the hypotheses of convex domain
and finite range are used in the proof. Both hypotheses are
needed to show: (1) the existence of a straight path from a
to b for all a, b (lemma 8). (2) that the ρ-weight of a directed
triangle is 0 (lemma 17). The convex domain hypothesis is
also needed for the convexity of the sets Da (section 3). The
finite range hypothesis is also needed to reduce theorem 4 to
the case that D is closed (section 2) and to prove that every
straight path from a to b has the same δ-weight (theorem
12).
