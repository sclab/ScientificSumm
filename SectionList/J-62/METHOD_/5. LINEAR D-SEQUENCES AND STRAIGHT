PATHS
For v, w ∈ D we write vw for the (closed) line segment
joining v and w.
A D-sequence −→u of order k is linear provided that there
is a sequence of real numbers 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ . . . ≤ λk = 1
such that ui = (1 − λi)u0 + λiuk. In particular, each ui
belongs to u0uk. For v, w ∈ D we write Lvw
for the set of
linear (v, w)-sequences.
For b, c ∈ A and v, w ∈ D we write LCvw
bc for the set of
compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Lvw
.
For a path −→a , we write L(−→a ) for the set of linear 
sequences compatible with −→a . We say that −→a is straight if
L(−→a ) = ∅.
For example, in figure 1, D-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is 
linear while (v, w, u, y, z), (x, w, p, y, z), and (x, v, w, y, z) are
not. Hence path (a, b, c, e) and (a, b, d, e) are both straight.
However, path (b, a, d, e) is not straight.

Lemma 8. Let b, c ∈ A and v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc. There is
a simple path −→a and D-sequence −→u such that (−→a , −→u ) ∈
LCvw
bc . Furthermore, for any such path −→a , δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) −
v(c).
Proof. By the convexity of D, any sequence of points on
vw is a D-sequence.
If b = c, singleton path −→a = (b) and D-sequence −→u =
(v, w) are obviously compatible. δ(−→a ) = 0 = v(b) − v(c).
So assume b = c. If Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, we pick an arbitrary
x from this set and let −→a = (b, c) ∈ SPbc, −→u = (v, x, w) ∈
Lvw
. Again it is easy to check the compatibility of (−→a , −→u ).
Since v ∈ Db, v(b) − v(c) ≥ δbc = δ(−→a ).
For the remaining case b = c and Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, notice
v = w otherwise v = w ∈ Db ∩ Dc ∩ vw. So we can define
λx for every point x on vw to be the unique number in [0, 1]
such that x = (1 − λx)v + λxw. For convenience, we write
x ≤ y for λx ≤ λy.
Let Ia = Da ∩ vw for each a ∈ A. Since D = ∪a∈ADa, we
have vw = ∪a∈AIa. Moreover, by the convexity of Da and
vw, Ia is a (possibly trivial) closed interval.
We begin by considering the case that Ib and Ic are each
a single point, that is, Ib = {v} and Ic = {w}.
Let S be a minimal subset of A satisfying ∪s∈SIs = vw.
For each s ∈ S, Is is maximal, i.e., not contained in any
other It, for t ∈ S. In particular, the intervals {Is : s ∈
S} have all left endpoints distinct and all right endpoints
distinct and the order of the left endpoints is the same as
that of the right endpoints. Let k = |S| + 2 and index S
as a2, . . . , ak−1 in the order defined by the right endpoints.
Denote the interval Iai by [li, ri]. Thus l2 < l3 < . . . < lk−1,
r2 < r3 < . . . < rk−1 and the fact that these intervals cover
vw implies l2 = v, rk−1 = w and for all 2 ≤ i ≤ k − 2,
li+1 ≤ ri which further implies li < ri. Now we define
the path −→a = (a1, a2, . . . , ak−1, ak) with a1 = b, ak = c
and a2, a3, . . . , ak−1 as above. Define the linear D-sequence
−→u = (u0, u1, . . . , uk) by u0 = u1 = v, uk = w and for
2 ≤ i ≤ k−1, ui = ri. It follows immediately that (−→a , −→u ) ∈
LCvw
bc . Neither b nor c is in S since lb = rb and lc = rc. Thus
−→a is simple.
Finally to show δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c), we note
v(b) − v(c) = v(a1) − v(ak) =
k−1X
i=1
(v(ai) − v(ai+1))
and
δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ) =
k−1X
i=1
(ui(ai) − ui(ai+1))
= v(a1) − v(a2) +
k−1X
i=2
(ri(ai) − ri(ai+1)).
For two outcomes d, e ∈ A, let us define fde(z) = z(d)−z(e)
for all z ∈ D. It suffices to show faiai+1 (ri) ≤ faiai+1 (v) for
2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Fact 9. For d, e ∈ A, fde(z) is a linear function of z.
Furthermore, if x ∈ Dd and y ∈ De with x = y, then
fde(x) = x(d) − x(e) ≥ δde ≥ −δed ≥ −(y(e) − y(d)) =
fde(y). Therefore fde(z) is monotonically nonincreasing along
the line
←→
xy as z moves in the direction from x to y.
Applying this fact with d = ai, e = ai+1, x = li and y = ri
gives the desired conclusion. This completes the proof for
the case that Ib = {v} and Ic = {w}.
For general Ib, Ic, rb < lc otherwise Db ∩ Dc ∩ vw = Ib ∩
Ic = ∅. Let v = rb and w = lc. Clearly we can apply the
above conclusion to v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc and get a compatible
pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCv w
bc with −→a simple and δ(−→a ) ≤ v (b) −
v (c). Define the linear D-sequence −→u by u0 = v, uk = w
and ui = ui for i ∈ [k − 1]. (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw
bc is evident.
Moreover, applying the above fact with d = b, e = c, x = v
and y = w, we get v(b) − v(c) ≥ v (b) − v (c) ≥ δ(−→a ).
Corollary 10. For any b, c ∈ A there is a straight (b, 
c)path.
The main result of this section (theorem 12) says that for
any b, c ∈ A, every straight (b, c)-path has the same δ-weight.
To prove this, we first fix v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc and show
(lemma 11) that every straight (b, c)-path compatible with
some linear (v, w)-sequence has the same δ-weight ρbc(v, w).
We then show in theorem 12 that ρbc(v, w) is the same for
all choices of v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc.
Lemma 11. For b, c ∈ A, there is a function ρbc : Db ×
Dc −→ R satisfying that for any (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw
bc , δ(−→a ) =
ρbc(v, w).
Proof. Let (−→a , −→u ), (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw
bc . It suffices to
show δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ). To do this we construct a linear
(v, w)-sequence −→u and paths −→a ∗
, −→a ∗∗
∈ Pbc, both 
compatible with −→u , satisfying δ(−→a ∗
) = δ(−→a ) and δ(−→a ∗∗
) = δ(−→a ).
Lemma 7 implies δ(−→a ∗
) = δ(−→a ∗∗
), which will complete the
proof.
Let |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = k and |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = l. We 
select −→u to be any linear (v, w)-sequence (u0, u1, . . . , ut) such
that −→u and −→u are both subsequences of −→u , i.e., there
are indices 0 = i0 < i1 < · · · < ik = t and 0 = j0 <
j1 < · · · < jl = t such that −→u = (ui0 , ui1 , . . . , uik ) and
−→u = (uj0 , uj1 , . . . , ujl ). We now construct a (b, c)-path
−→a ∗
compatible with −→u such that δ(−→a ∗
) = δ(−→a ). (An
analogous construction gives −→a ∗∗
compatible with −→u such
that δ(−→a ∗∗
) = δ(−→a ).) This will complete the proof.
−→a ∗
is defined as follows: for 1 ≤ j ≤ t, a∗
j = ar where
r is the unique index satisfying ir−1 < j ≤ ir. Since both
uir−1 = ur−1 and uir = ur belong to Dar
, uj ∈ Dar
for
ir−1 ≤ j ≤ ir by the convexity of Dar
. The compatibility of
(−→a ∗
, −→u ) follows immediately. Clearly, a∗
1 = a1 = b and a∗
t =
ak = c, so −→a ∗
∈ Pbc. Furthermore, as δa∗
j a∗
j+1
= δarar
= 0
for each r ∈ [k], ir−1 < j < ir,
δ(−→a ∗
) =
k−1X
r=1
δa∗

ir+1

δarar+1
= δ(−→a ).
We are now ready for the main theorem of the section:
Theorem 12. ρbc is a constant map on Db × Dc. Thus
for any b, c ∈ A, every straight (b, c)-path has the same 
δweight.
Proof. For a path −→a , (v, w) is compatible with −→a if
there is a linear (v, w)-sequence compatible with −→a . We
write CP(−→a ) for the set of pairs (v, w) compatible with
−→a . ρbc is constant on CP(−→a ) because for each (v, w) ∈
CP(−→a ), ρbc(v, w) = δ(−→a ). By lemma 8, we also haveS
−→a ∈SPbc
CP(−→a ) = Db ×Dc. Since A is finite, SPbc, the set
of simple paths from b to c, is finite as well.
290
Next we prove that for any path −→a , CP(−→a ) is closed.
Let ((vn
, wn
) : n ∈ N) be a convergent sequence in CP(−→a )
and let (v, w) be the limit. We want to show that (v, w) ∈
CP(−→a ). For each n ∈ N, since (vn
, wn
) ∈ CP(−→a ), there is
a linear (vn
, wn
)-sequence un
compatible with −→a , i.e., there
are 0 = λn
0 ≤ λn
1 ≤ . . . ≤ λn
k = 1 (k = |−→a |) such that
un
j = (1 − λn
j )vn
+ λn
j wn
(j = 0, 1, . . . , k). Since for each
n, λn
= (λn
0 , λn
1 , . . . , λn
k ) belongs to the closed bounded set
[0, 1]k+1
we can choose an infinite subset I ⊆ N such that the
sequence (λn
: n ∈ I) converges. Let λ = (λ0, λ1, . . . , λk) be
the limit. Clearly 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λk = 1.
Define the linear (v, w)-sequence −→u by uj = (1 − λj )v +
λj w (j = 0, 1, . . . , k). Then for each j ∈ {0, . . . , k}, uj is
the limit of the sequence (un
j : n ∈ I). For j > 0, each un
j
belongs to the closed set Daj , so uj ∈ Daj . Similarly, for j <
k each un
j belongs to the closed set Daj+1 , so uj ∈ Daj+1 .
Hence (−→a , −→u ) is compatible, implying (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ).
Now we have Db × Dc covered by finitely many closed
subsets on each of them ρbc is a constant.
Suppose for contradiction that there are (v, w), (v , w ) ∈
Db × Dc such that ρbc(v, w) = ρbc(v , w ).
L = {((1 − λ)v + λv , (1 − λ)w + λw ) : λ ∈ [0, 1]}
is a line segment in Db ×Dc by the convexity of Db, Dc. Let
L1 = {(x, y) ∈ L : ρbc(x, y) = ρbc(v, w)}
and L2 = L − L1. Clearly (v, w) ∈ L1, (v , w ) ∈ L2. Let
P = {−→a ∈ SPbc : δ(−→a ) = ρbc(v, w)}.
L1 =
`S
−→a ∈P CP(−→a )
´
∩ L, L2 =
S
−→a ∈SPbc−P CP(−→a )

∩ L
are closed by the finiteness of P. This is a contradiction,
since it is well known (and easy to prove) that a line segment
can not be expressed as the disjoint union of two nonempty
closed sets.
Summarizing corollary 10, lemma 11 and theorem 12, we
have
Corollary 13. For any b, c ∈ A, there is a real number
ρbc with the property that (1) There is at least one straight
(b, c)-path of δ-weight ρbc and (2) Every straight (b, c)-path
has δ-weight ρbc.
