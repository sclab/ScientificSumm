Lemma 14. ρbc ≤ δbc for all b, c ∈ A.
Proof. For contradiction, suppose ρbc − δbc = > 0.
By the definition of δbc, there exists v ∈ f−1
(b) ⊆ Db with
v(b) − v(c) < δbc + = ρbc. Pick an arbitrary w ∈ Dc.
By lemma 8, there is a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw
bc
with δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c). Since −→a is a straight (b, c)-path,
ρbc = δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c), leading to a contradiction.
Define another edge-weighted complete directed graph Gf
on vertex set A where the weight of arc (a, b) is ρab. 
Immediately from lemma 14, the weight of every directed cycle in
Gf is bounded below by its weight in Gf . To prove theorem
4, it suffices to show the zero cycle property of Gf , i.e., 
every directed cycle has weight zero. We begin by considering
two-cycles.
Lemma 15. ρbc + ρcb = 0 for all b, c ∈ A.
Proof. Let −→a be a straight (b, c)-path compatible with
linear sequence −→u . let −→a be the reverse of −→a and −→u the
reverse of −→u . Obviously, (−→a , −→u ) is compatible as well and
thus −→a is a straight (c, b)-path. Therefore,
ρbc + ρcb = δ(−→a ) + δ(−→a ) =
k−1X
i=1
δaiai+1 +
k−1X
i=1
δai+1ai
=
k−1X
i=1
(δaiai+1 + δai+1ai ) = 0,
where the final equality uses proposition 5.
Next, for three cycles, we first consider those compatible
with linear triples.
Lemma 16. If there are collinear points u ∈ Da, v ∈ Db,
w ∈ Dc (a, b, c ∈ A), ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0.
Proof. First, we prove for the case where v is between u
and w. From lemma 8, there are compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) ∈
LCuv
ab , (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw
bc . Let |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = k and
|−→a | = ord(−→u ) = l. We paste −→a and −→a together as
−→a = (a = a1, a2, . . . , ak−1, ak, a1 , . . . , al = c),
−→u and −→u as
−→u = (u = u0, u1, . . . , uk = v = u0 , u1 , . . . , ul = w).
Clearly (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCuw
ac and
δ(−→a ) =
k−1X
i=1
δaiai+1
+ δak
a1
+
l−1X
i=1
δai ai+1
= δ(−→a ) + δbb + δ(−→a )
= δ(−→a ) + δ(−→a ).
Therefore, ρac = δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ) + δ(−→a ) = ρab + ρbc.
Moreover, ρac = −ρca by lemma 15, so we get ρab + ρbc +
ρca = 0.
Now suppose w is between u and v. By the above 
argument, we have ρac + ρcb + ρba = 0 and by lemma 15,
ρab + ρbc + ρca = −ρba − ρcb − ρac = 0.
The case that u is between v and w is similar.
Now we are ready for the zero three-cycle property:
Lemma 17. ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0 for all a, b, c ∈ A.
Proof. Let S = {(a, b, c) : ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0} and
for contradiction, suppose S = ∅. S is finite. For each
a ∈ A, choose va ∈ Da arbitrarily and let T be the convex
hull of {va : a ∈ A}. For each (a, b, c) ∈ S, let Rabc =
Da × Db × Dc ∩ T3
. Clearly, each Rabc is nonempty and
compact. Moreover, by lemma 16, no (u, v, w) ∈ Rabc is
collinear.
Define f : D3
→ R by f(u, v, w) = |v−u|+|w−v|+|u−w|.
For (a, b, c) ∈ S, the restriction of f to the compact set Rabc
attains a minimum m(a, b, c) at some point (u, v, w) ∈ Rabc
by the continuity of f, i.e., there exists a triangle ∆uvw of
minimum perimeter within T with u ∈ Da, v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc.
Choose (a∗
, b∗
, c∗
) ∈ S so that m(a∗
, b∗
, c∗
) is minimum
and let (u∗
, v∗
, w∗
) ∈ Ra∗b∗c∗ be a triple achieving it. Pick
an arbitrary point p in the interior of ∆u∗
v∗
w∗
. By the
convexity of domain D, there is d ∈ A such that p ∈ Dd.
291
Consider triangles ∆u∗
pw∗
, ∆w∗
pv∗
and ∆v∗
pu∗
. Since
each of them has perimeter less than that of ∆u∗
v∗
w∗
and
all three triangles are contained in T, by the minimality of
∆u∗
v∗
w∗
, (a∗
, d, c∗
), (c∗
, d, b∗
), (b∗
, d, a∗
) ∈ S. Thus
ρa∗d + ρdc∗ + ρc∗a∗ = 0,
ρc∗d + ρdb∗ + ρb∗c∗ = 0,
ρb∗d + ρda∗ + ρa∗b∗ = 0.
Summing up the three equalities,
(ρa∗d + ρdc∗ + ρc∗d + ρdb∗ + ρb∗d + ρda∗ )
+(ρc∗a∗ + ρb∗c∗ + ρa∗b∗ ) = 0,
which yields a contradiction
ρa∗b∗ + ρb∗c∗ + ρc∗a∗ = 0.
With the zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties, the
zero cycle property of Gf is immediate. As noted earlier,
this completes the proof of theorem 4.
Theorem 18. Every directed cycle of Gf has weight zero.
Proof. Clearly, zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties
imply triangle equality ρab +ρbc = ρac for all a, b, c ∈ A. For
a directed cycle C = a1a2 . . . aka1, by inductively applying
triangle equality, we have
Pk−1
i=1 ρaiai+1 = ρa1ak . Therefore,
the weight of C is
k−1X
i=1
ρaiai+1 + ρaka1 = ρa1ak + ρaka1 = 0.
As final remarks, we note that our result implies the 
following strengthenings of theorem 12:
Corollary 19. For any b, c ∈ A, every admissible (b, 
c)path has the same δ-weight ρbc.
Proof. First notice that for any b, c ∈ A, if Db ∩Dc = ∅,
δbc = ρbc. To see this, pick v ∈ Db ∩ Dc arbitrarily. 
Obviously, path −→a = (b, c) is compatible with linear sequence
−→u = (v, v, v) and is thus a straight (b, c)-path. Hence
ρbc = δ(−→a ) = δbc.
Now for any b, c ∈ A and any (b, c)-path −→a with C(−→a ) =
∅, let −→u ∈ C(−→a ). Since ui ∈ Dai ∩ Dai+1 for i ∈ [|−→a | − 1],
δ(−→a ) =
|−→a |−1
X
i=1
δaiai+1 =
|−→a |−1
X
i=1
ρaiai+1 ,
which by theorem 18, = −ρa|−→a |a1 = ρa1a|−→a |
= ρbc.
Corollary 20. For any b, c ∈ A, ρbc is equal to δ∗
bc, the
minimum δ-weight over all (b, c)-paths.
Proof. Clearly ρbc ≥ δ∗
bc by corollary 13. On the other
hand, for every (b, c)-path −→a = (b = a1, a2, . . . , ak = c), by
lemma 14,
δ(−→a ) =
k−1X
i=1
δaiai+1 ≥
k−1X
i=1
ρaiai+1 ,
which by theorem 18, = −ρaka1 = ρa1ak = ρbc. Hence ρbc ≤
δ∗
bc, which completes the proof.
