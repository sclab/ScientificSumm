FORMS OF THEOREM 4
Theorem 4 applies to social choice functions with convex
domain and finite range. We now show that neither of these
hypotheses can be omitted. Our examples are single player
functions.
The first example illustrates that convexity can not be
omitted. We present an untruthful single player social choice
function with three outcomes a, b, c satisfying W-MON on a
path-connected but non-convex domain. The domain is the
boundary of a triangle whose vertices are x = (0, 1, −1), y =
(−1, 0, 1) and z = (1, −1, 0). x and the open line segment
zx is assigned outcome a, y and the open line segment xy
is assigned outcome b, and z and the open line segment
yz is assigned outcome c. Clearly, δab = −δba = δbc =
−δcb = δca = −δac = −1, W-MON (the nonnegative 
twocycle property) holds. Since there is a negative cycle δab +
δbc + δca = −3, by lemma 3, this is not a truthful choice
function.
We now show that the hypothesis of finite range can not
be omitted. We construct a family of single player social
choice functions each having a convex domain and an infinite
number of outcomes, and satisfying weak monotonicity but
not truthfulness.
Our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and
an n × n matrix M satisfying the following properties: (1)
M is non-singular. (2) M is positive semidefinite. (3) There
are distinct i1, i2, . . . , ik ∈ [n] satisfying
k−1X
j=1
(M(ij, ij) − M(ij , ij+1)) + (M(ik, ik) − M(ik, i1)) < 0.
Here is an example matrix with n = 3 and (i1, i2, i3) =

Let e1, e2, . . . , en denote the standard basis of Rn
. Let
Sn denote the convex hull of {e1, e2 . . . , en}, which is the
set of vectors in Rn
with nonnegative coordinates that sum
to 1. The range of our social choice function will be the
set Sn and the domain D will be indexed by Sn, that is
D = {yλ : λ ∈ Sn}, where yλ is defined below. The function
f maps yλ to λ.
Next we specify yλ. By definition, D must be a set of
functions from Sn to R. For λ ∈ Sn, the domain element
yλ : Sn −→ R is defined by yλ(α) = λT
Mα. The 
nonsingularity of M guarantees that yλ = yµ for λ = µ ∈ Sn.
It is easy to see that D is a convex subset of the set of all
functions from Sn to R.
The outcome graph Gf is an infinite graph whose vertex
set is the outcome set A = Sn. For outcomes λ, µ ∈ A, the
edge weight δλµ is equal to
δλµ = inf{v(λ) − v(µ) : f(v) = λ}
= yλ(λ) − yλ(µ) = λT
Mλ − λT
Mµ = λT
M(λ − µ).
We claim that Gf satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle 
property (W-MON) but has a negative cycle (and hence is not
truthful).
For outcomes λ, µ ∈ A,
δλµ +δµλ = λT
M(λ−µ)+µT
M(µ−λ) = (λ−µ)T
M(λ−µ),
292
which is nonnegative since M is positive semidefinite. Hence
the nonnegative two-cycle property holds. Next we show
that Gf has a negative cycle. Let i1, i2, . . . , ik be a 
sequence of indices satisfying property 3 of M. We claim
ei1 ei2 . . . eik ei1 is a negative cycle. Since
δeiej = eT
i M(ei − ej) = M(i, i) − M(i, j)
for any i, j ∈ [k], the weight of the cycle

(M(ij , ij ) − M(ij, ij+1)) + (M(ik, ik) − M(ik, i1)) < 0,
which completes the proof.
Finally, we point out that the third property imposed on
the matrix M has the following interpretation. Let R(M) =
{r1, r2, . . . , rn} be the set of row vectors of M and let hM be
the single player social choice function with domain R(M)
and range {1, 2, . . . , n} mapping ri to i. Property 3 is 
equivalent to the condition that the outcome graph GhM has a
negative cycle. By lemma 3, this is equivalent to the 
condition that hM is untruthful.
