In this section, we construct a family of closed convex sets
{Da : a ∈ A} with disjoint interiors whose union is D and
satisfying f−1
(a) ⊆ Da for each a ∈ A.
Let Ra = {v : ∀b ∈ A, v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab}. Ra is a closed
polyhedron containing f−1
(a). The next proposition 
implies that any two of these polyhedra intersect only on their
boundary.
Proposition 5. Let a, b ∈ A. If v ∈ Ra ∩Rb then v(a)−
v(b) = δab = −δba.

Proof. v ∈ Ra implies v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab and v ∈ Rb
implies v(b)−v(a) ≥ δba which, by the nonnegative two-cycle
property, implies v(a) − v(b) ≤ δab. Thus v(a) − v(b) = δab
and by symmetry v(b) − v(a) = δba.
Finally, we restrict the collection of sets {Ra : a ∈ A}
to the domain D by defining Da = Ra ∩ D for each a ∈
A. Clearly, Da is closed and convex, and contains f−1
(a).
Therefore
S
a∈A Da = D. Also, by proposition 5, any point
v in Da ∩ Db satisfies v(a) − v(b) = δab = −δba.
