We have seen that the system is well behaved if the agents
all follow a threshold strategy; we now want to show that
there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium where they do so (that
is, a Nash equilibrium where all the agents use Sk for some
k > 0.) This is not true in general. If δ is small, then agents
have no incentive to work. Intuitively, if future utility is
sufficiently discounted, then all that matters is the present,
and there is no point in volunteering to work. With small
δ, S0 is the only equilibrium. However, we show that for δ
sufficiently large, there is another equilibrium in threshold
strategies. We do this by first showing that, if every other
agent is playing a threshold strategy, then there is a best
response that is also a threshold strategy (although not 
necessarily the same one). We then show that there must be
some (mixed) threshold strategy for which this best response
is the same strategy. It follows that this tuple of threshold
strategies is a Nash equilibrium.
As a first step, we show that, for all k, if everyone other
than agent i is playing Sk, then there is a threshold 
strategy Sk that is a best response for agent i. To prove this,
we need to assume that the system is close to the 
steadystate distribution (i.e., the maximum-entropy distribution).
However, as long as δ is sufficiently close to 1, we can ignore
what happens during the period that the system is not in
steady state.3
We have thus far considered threshold strategies of the
form Sk, where k is a natural number; this is a discrete set
of strategies. For a later proof, it will be helpful to have
a continuous set of strategies. If γ = k + γ , where k is
a natural number and 0 ≤ γ < 1, let Sγ be the strategy
that performs Sk with probability 1 − γ and Sk+1 with
probability γ. (Note that we are not considering arbitrary
mixed threshold strategies here, but rather just mixing 
between adjacent strategies for the sole purpose of making out
strategies continuous in a natural way.) Theorem 3.1 
applies to strategies Sγ (the same proof goes through without
change), where γ is an arbitrary nonnegative real number.
Theorem 4.1. Fix a strategy Sγ and an agent i. There
exists δ∗
< 1 and n∗
such that if δ > δ∗
, n > n∗
, and every
agent other than i is playing Sγ in game G(n, δ), then there
is an integer k such that the best response for agent i is Sk .
Either k is unique (that is, there is a unique best response
that is also a threshold strategy), or there exists an integer
k such that Sγ is a best response for agent i for all γ in
the interval [k , k +1] (and these are the only best responses
among threshold strategies).
Proof. (Sketch:) If δ is sufficiently large, we can ignore
what happens before the system converges to the 
maximumentropy distribution. If n is sufficiently large, then the 
strategy played by one agent will not affect the distribution of
money significantly. Thus, the probability of i moving from
one state (dollar amount) to another depends only on i"s
strategy (since we can take the probability that i will be
chosen to make a request and the probability that i will
be chosen to satisfy a request to be constant). Thus, from
i"s point of view, the system is a Markov decision process
(MDP), and i needs to compute the optimal policy 
(strategy) for this MDP. It follows from standard results [23, 
Theorem 6.11.6] that there is an optimal policy that is a 
threshold policy.
The argument that the best response is either unique or
there is an interval of best responses follows from a more
careful analysis of the value function for the MDP.
We remark that there may be best responses that are not
threshold strategies. All that Theorem 4.1 shows is that,
among best responses, there is at least one that is a threshold
strategy. Since we know that there is a best response that
is a threshold strategy, we can look for a Nash equilibrium
in the space of threshold strategies.
Theorem 4.2. For all M, there exists δ∗
< 1 and n∗
such
that if δ > δ∗
and n > n∗
, there exists a Nash equilibrium in
the game G(n, δ) where all agents play Sγ for some integer
γ > 0.
Proof. It follows easily from the proof Theorem 4.1 that
if br(δ, γ) is the minimal best response threshold strategy if
all the other agents are playing Sγ and the discount factor is
δ then, for fixed δ, br(δ, ·) is a step function. It also follows

Formally, we need to define the strategies when the system
is far from equilibrium. However, these far from (stochastic)
equilibrium strategies will not affect the equilibrium 
behavior when n is large and deviations from stochastic 
equilibrium are extremely rare.

from the theorem that if there are two best responses, then
a mixture of them is also a best response. Therefore, if we
can join the steps by a vertical line, we get a best-response
curve. It is easy to see that everywhere that this 
bestresponse curve crosses the diagonal y = x defines a Nash
equilibrium where all agents are using the same threshold
strategy. As we have already observed, one such 
equilibrium occurs at 0. If there are only $M in the system, we can
restrict to threshold strategies Sk where k ≤ M + 1. Since
no one can have more than $M, all strategies Sk for k > M
are equivalent to SM ; these are just the strategies where
the agent always volunteers in response to request made by
someone who can pay. Clearly br(δ, SM ) ≤ M for all δ, so
the best response function is at or below the equilibrium at
M. If k ≤ M/n, every player will have at least k dollars
and so will be unwilling to work and the best response is
just 0. Consider k∗
, the smallest k such that k > M/n. It
is not hard to show that for k∗
there exists a δ∗
such that
for all δ ≥ δ∗
, br(δ, k∗
) ≥ k∗
. It follows by continuity that if
δ ≥ δ∗
, there must be some γ such that br(δ, γ) = γ. This
is the desired Nash equilibrium.
This argument also shows us that we cannot in general
expect fixed points to be unique. If br(δ, k∗
) = k∗
and
br(δ, k + 1) > k + 1 then our argument shows there must be
a second fixed point. In general there may be multiple fixed
points even when br(δ, k∗
) > k∗
, as illustrated in the Figure
4 with n = 1000 and M = 3000.

Theorem 4.2 allows us to restrict our design to agents
using threshold strategies with the confidence that there will
be a nontrivial equilibrium. However, it does not rule out
the possibility that there may be other equilibria that do
not involve threshold stratgies. It is even possible (although
it seems unlikely) that some of these equilibria might be
better.
