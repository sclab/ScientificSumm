A good static ranking is an important component for today"s
search engines and information retrieval systems. We have
demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static
ranking; there are many simple features that individually out
perform PageRank. By combining many static features, fRank
achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise
accuracy than PageRank alone. A qualitative evaluation of the top
documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than
PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that
Web users, rather than Web authors, visit. The machine learning
component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more
robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further
developments in the machine learning community in areas such as
adversarial classification. We have only begun to explore the
options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the
area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional
features, other machine learning techniques, and additional
sources of data.
