To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the
ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each
page. We divided our feature set into four, mutually exclusive,
categories: page-level (Page), domain-level (Domain), anchor text
and inlinks (Anchor), and popularity (Popularity). We also
optionally used the PageRank of a page as a feature. Below, we
describe each of these feature categories in more detail.
PageRank
We computed PageRank on a Web graph of 5 billion crawled
pages (and 20 billion known URLs linked to by these pages).
This represents a significant portion of the Web, and is
approximately the same number of pages as are used by
Google, Yahoo, and MSN for their search engines.
Because PageRank is a graph-based algorithm, it is important
that it be run on as large a subset of the Web as possible. Most
previous studies on PageRank used subsets of the Web that are
significantly smaller (e.g. the TREC VLC2 corpus, used by
many, contains only 19 million pages)
We computed PageRank using the standard value of 0.85 for Î±.
Popularity
Another feature we used is the actual popularity of a Web page,
measured as the number of times that it has been visited by
users over some period of time. We have access to such data
from users who have installed the MSN toolbar and have opted
to provide it to MSN. The data is aggregated into a count, for
each Web page, of the number of users who viewed that page.
Though popularity data is generally unavailable, there are two
other sources for it. The first is from proxy logs. For example, a
university that requires its students to use a proxy has a record
of all the pages they have visited while on campus.
Unfortunately, proxy data is quite biased and relatively small.
Another source, internal to search engines, are records of which
results their users clicked on. Such data was used by the search
engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for
dynamic ranking purposes [20]. An advantage of the toolbar
data over this is that it contains information about URL visits
that are not just the result of a search.
The raw popularity is processed into a number of features such
as the number of times a page was viewed and the number of
times any page in the domain was viewed. More details are
provided in section 5.5.
Anchor text and inlinks
These features are based on the information associated with
links to the page in question. It includes features such as the
total amount of text in links pointing to the page (anchor
text), the number of unique words in that text, etc.
Page
This category consists of features which may be determined by
looking at the page (and its URL) alone. We used only eight,
simple features such as the number of words in the body, the
frequency of the most common term, etc.
Domain
This category contains features that are computed as averages
across all pages in the domain. For example, the average
number of outlinks on any page and the average PageRank.
Many of these features have been used by others for ranking Web
pages, particularly the anchor and page features. As mentioned,
the evaluation is typically for dynamic ranking, and we wish to
evaluate the use of them for static ranking. Also, to our
knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page
visitation popularity for static ranking. The closest similar work is
on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine
results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g.,
[20]).
Because we use a wide variety of features to come up with a static
ranking, we refer to this as fRank (for feature-based ranking).
fRank uses RankNet and the set of features described in this
section to learn a ranking function for Web pages. Unless
otherwise specified, fRank was trained with all of the features.
