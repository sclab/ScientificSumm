A lot of research has been done on various aspects of 
combinatorial auctions. We recommend [2] for a good review.
However, the study of distributed winner determination 
algorithms for combinatorial auctions is still relatively new.
One approach is given by the algorithms for distributing
the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions
presented in [7], but these algorithms assume the 
computational entities are the items being sold and thus end up
with a different type of distribution. The VSA algorithm
[3] is another way of performing distributed winner 
determination in combinatorial auction but it assumes the bids
themselves perform the computation. This algorithm also
fails to converge to a solution for most cases. In [9] the 
authors present a distributed mechanism for calculating VCG
payments in a mechanism design problem. Their 
mechanism roughly amounts to having each agent calculate the
payments for two other agents and give these to a secure

central server which then checks to make sure results from
all pairs agree, otherwise a re-calculation is ordered. This
general idea, which they call the redundancy principle, could
also be applied to our problem but it requires the existence
of a secure center agent that everyone trusts. Another 
interesting approach is given in [8] where the bidding agents
prioritize their bids, thus reducing the set of bids that the
centralized winner determination algorithm must consider,
making that problem easier. Finally, in the computation
procuring clock auction [1] the agents are given an 
everincreasing percentage of the surplus achieved by their 
proposed solution over the current best. As such, it assumes
the agents are impartial computational entities, not the set
of possible buyers as assumed by the PAUSE auction.
