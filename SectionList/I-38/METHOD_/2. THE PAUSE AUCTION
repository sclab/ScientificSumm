A PAUSE auction for m items has m stages. Stage 1 
consists of having simultaneous ascending price open-cry 
auctions and during this stage the bidders can only place bids on
individual items. At the end of this state we will know what
the highest bid for each individual item is and who placed
that bid. Each successive stage k = 2, 3, . . . , m consists of
an ascending price auction where the bidders must submit
bidsets that cover all items but each one of the bids must be
for k items or less. The bidders are allowed to use bids that
other agents have placed in previous rounds when building
their bidsets, thus allowing them to find better solutions.
Also, any new bidset has to have a sum of bid prices which
is bigger than that of the currently winning bidset. At the
end of each stage k all agents know the best bid for every
subset of size k or less. Also, at any point in time after stage
1 has ended there is a standing bidset whose value increases
monotonically as new bidsets are submitted. Since in the
final round all agents consider all possible bidsets, we know
that the final winning bidset will be one such that no agent
can propose a better bidset. Note, however, that this 
bidset is not guaranteed to be the one that maximizes revenue
since we are using an ascending price auction so the 
winning bid for each set will be only slightly bigger than the
second highest bid for the particular set of items. That is,
the final prices will not be the same as the prices in a 
traditional combinatorial auction where all the bidders bid their
true valuation. However, there remains the open question
of whether the final distribution of items to bidders found
in a PAUSE auction is the same as the revenue maximizing
solution. Our test results provide an answer to this question.
The PAUSE auction makes the job of the auctioneer very
easy. All it has to do is to make sure that each new 
bidset has a revenue bigger than the current winning bidset, as
well as make sure that every bid in an agent"s bidset that
is not his does indeed correspond to some other agents" 
previous bid. The computational problem shifts from one of
winner determination to one of bid generation. Each agent
must search over the space of all bidsets which contain at
least one of its bids. The search is made easier by the fact
that the agent needs to consider only the current best bids
and only wants bidsets where its own utility is higher than
in the current winning bidset. Each agent also has a clear
incentive for performing this computation, namely, its 
utility only increases with each bidset it proposes (of course, it
might decrease with the bidsets that others propose). 
Finally, the PAUSE auction has been shown to be envy-free in
that at the conclusion of the auction no bidder would prefer
to exchange his allocation with that of any other bidder [2].
We can even envision completely eliminating the 
auctioneer and, instead, have every agent perform the task of the
auctioneer. That is, all bids are broadcast and when an
agent receives a bid from another agent it updates the set
of best bids and determines if the new bid is indeed better
than the current winning bid. The agents would have an 
incentive to perform their computation as it will increase their
expected utility. Also, any lies about other agents" bids are
easily found out by keeping track of the bids sent out by 
every agent (the set of best bids). Namely, the only one that
can increase an agent"s bid value is the agent itself. 
Anyone claiming a higher value for some other agent is lying.
The only thing missing is an algorithm that calculates the
utility-maximizing bidset for each agent.
