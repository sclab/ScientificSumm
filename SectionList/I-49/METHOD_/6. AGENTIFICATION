How the problem is transposed in a MAS problem is a
very important aspect when designing such a system. The
agentification has an influence upon the systems efficiency in
solving the problem. Therefore, in this section, we describe
the elements and constraints taken into account during the
modelling phase and for the model itself. However, for this
negotiation application, the modelling is quite natural when
one observes the negotiation protocol motivations and main
properties.
First of all, it seems obvious that there should be one agent
for each player of our multilateral multi-issue negotiation
protocol. The agents have the involved parties" information
and preferences. These agents are:
• Autonomous: they decide for themselves what, when
and under what conditions actions should be 
performed;
• Rational: they have a means-ends competence to fit
its decisions, according to its knowledge, preferences
and goal;
• Self-interested: they have their own interests which
may conflict with the interests of other agents.
Moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal
evaluated and analysed using MYRIAD. Each agent has
private information and can access public information as
knowledge.
In fact, there are two types of agents: the mediator type
for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our 
negotiation protocol, the delegated physician in our application,
and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to
the other parties, the hospitals. The main behaviours that
an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol
are the following:
• convert_improvements: converts the information 
given by the other agents involved in the negotiation
about the improvements to be done, into constraints
on the next proposal to be made;
• convert_no_decrease: converts the information given
by the other agents involved in the negotiation about
the points that should not be changed into constraints
on the next proposal to be made;
• construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal 
according to the constraints obtained with 
convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent 
preferences;
The main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator
needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following:
• convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a MYRIAD
option of the agent according to its preferences model
and its private data;
• convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent 
recommendations for the improvements of a MYRIAD 
option into general information on the proposal;
• convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent 
recommendations about the criteria that should not be 
changed in the MYRIAD option into general information
on the proposal;
In addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types
of agents, access behaviours to MYRIAD functionalities
such as the evaluation and improvement functions:
• evaluate_option: evaluates the MYRIAD option 
obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal;
• improvements: gets the agent recommendations to 
improve a proposal from the MYRIAD option;
• no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not
change some criteria from the MYRIAD option;
Of course, before running the system with such agents, we
must have defined each party preferences model in 
MYRIAD. This model has to be part of the agent so that it could
be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the 
improvements. In addition to these behaviours, the communication
acts between the agents is as follows.

(a) propose: sends a message containing a proposal
to all negotiator agents;
(b) inform: sends a message to all negotiator agents
to inform them that an agreement has been 
reached and containing the consensus outcome.
2. negotiator agent communication acts:
(a) accept-proposal: sends a message to the 
mediator agent containing the agent recommendations
to improve the proposal and obtained with
convert_improvements_wc;
(b) reject-proposal: sends a message to the 
mediator agent containing the agent recommendations
about the criteria that should not be changed and
obtained with convert_no_decrease_wc.
Such agents are interchangeable, in a case of failure, since
they all have the same properties and represent a user with
his preference model, not depending on the agent, but on the
model defined in MYRIAD. When the issues and the 
decision criteria are different from each other, the information
about the criteria improvement have to be pre-processed to
give some instructions on the directions to take and about
the negotiated issues. It is the same for the evaluation of a
proposal: each agent has to convert the information about
the issues to update its private information and to obtain
the values of each attribute of the decision criteria.
