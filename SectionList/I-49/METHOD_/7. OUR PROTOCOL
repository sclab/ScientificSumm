Formally, we consider negotiations where a set of 
players A = {1, 2, . . . , m} and a player a are negotiating over
a set Q of size q. The player a is the protocol 
mediator, the mediator agent of the agentification. The 
utility/preference function of a player k ∈ A ∪ {a} is Uk, 
defined using MYRIAD, as presented in Section 4, with a set
Nk of criteria, Xk
an option, and so on. An offer is a 
vector P = (P1, P2, · · · , Pm), a partition of Q, in which Pk is
player k"s share of Q. We have P ∈ P where P is the set of
admissible proposals, a finite set. Note that P is determined
using all players general constraints on the proposals and Q.
Moreover, let ˜P denote a particular proposal defined as a"s
preferred proposal.
We also have the following notation: δk is the 
threshold decrease factor of player k, Φk : Pk → Xk
is player
k"s function to convert a proposal to an option and Ψk is
the function indicating which points P has to be improved,
with Ψk its dual function - on which points no 
improvement is necessary. Ψk is obtained using the dual function of

Where eEC (τ, x) is the cost/effort to go from (τxC , xNk\C )
to x.
In period t of our consensus procedure, player a proposes
an agreement P. All players k ∈ A respond to a by 
accepting or rejecting P. The responses are made simultaneously.
If all players k ∈ A accept the offer, the game ends. If any
player k rejects P, then the next period t+1 begins: player a
makes another proposal P by taking into account 
information provided by the players and the ones that have rejected
P apply a penalty. Therefore, our negotiation protocol can
be as follows:
Protocol P1.
• At the beginning, we set period t = 0
• a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been
proposed before.
• Wait that all players of A give their opinion
Yes or No to the player a. If all players
agree on P, this later is chosen. Otherwise
t is incremented and we go back to previous
point.
• If there is no more offer left from P, the
default offer ˜P will be chosen.
• The utility of players regarding a given 
offer decreases over time. More precisely, the
utility of player k ∈ A at period t regarding
offer P is Uk(Φk(Pk), t) = ft(Uk(Φk(Pk))),
where one can take for instance ft(x) =
x.(δk)t
or ft(x) = x − δk.t, as penalty 
function.
Lemma 1. Protocol P1 has at least one subgame perfect
equilibrium 1
.
Proof : Protocol P1 is first transformed in a game in 
extensive form. To this end, one shall specify the order in which
the responders A react to the offer P of a. However the
order in which the players answer has no influence on the
course of the game and in particular on their personal 
utility. Hence protocol P1 is strictly equivalent to a game in
1
A subgame perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium such that
players" strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every
subgame of the original game [18, 16]. A Nash equilibrium
is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player
has incentive to unilaterally change his/her action [15].

extensive form, considering any order of the players A. This
game is clearly finite since P is finite and each offer can
only be proposed once. Finally P1 corresponds to a game
with perfect information. We end the proof by using a 
classical result stating that any finite game in extensive form
with perfect information has at least one subgame perfect
equilibrium (see e.g. [16]).
Rational players (in the sense of von Neumann and 
Morgenstern) involved in protocol P1 will necessarily come up
with a subgame perfect equilibrium.
Example 1. Consider an example with A = {1, 2} and
P = {P1
, P2
, P3
} where the default offer is P1
. Assume
that ft(x) = x − 0.1 t. Consider the following table giving
the utilities at t = 0.
P1
P2
P3
a 1 0.8 0.7
1 0.1 0.7 0.5
2 0.1 0.3 0.8
It is easy to see that there is one single subgame perfect 
equilibrium for protocol P1 corresponding to these values. This
equilibrium consists of the following choices: first a proposes
P3
; player 1 rejects this offer; a proposes then P2
and both
players 1 and 2 accepts otherwise they are threatened to 
receive the worse offer P1
for them. Finally offer P2
is 
chosen. Option P1
is the best one for a but the two other players
vetoed it. It is interesting to point out that, even though a
prefers P2
to P3
, offer P3
is first proposed and this make
P2
being accepted. If a proposes P2
first, then the subgame
perfect equilibrium in this situation is P3
. To sum up, the
worse preferred options have to be proposed first in order to
get finally the best one. But this entails a waste of time.
Analysing the previous example, one sees that the game
outcome at the equilibrium is P2
that is not very attractive
for player 2. Option P3
seems more balanced since no player
judges it badly. It could be seen as a better solution as a
consensus among the agents.
In order to introduce this notion of balanceness in the
protocol, we introduce a condition under which a player will
be obliged to accept the proposal, reducing the autonomy
of the agents but for increasing rationality and cooperation.
More precisely if the utility of a player is larger than a given
threshold then acceptance is required. The threshold 
decreases over time so that players have to make more and
more concession. Therefore, the protocol becomes as 
follows.
Protocol P2.
• At the beginning we set period t = 0
• a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been
proposed before.
• Wait that all players of A give their opinion
Yes or No to the player a. A player k must
accept the offer if Uk(Φk(Pk)) ≥ ρk(t) where
ρk(t) tends to zero when t grows. 
Moreover there exists T such that for all t ≥ T,
ρk(t) = 0. If all players agree on P, this
later is chosen. Otherwise t is incremented
and we go back to previous point.
• If there is no more offer left from P, the
default offer ˜P will be chosen.
One can show exactly as in Lemma 1 that protocol P2
has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium. We expect
that protocol P2 provides a solution not to far from P ,
so it favours fairness among the players. Therefore, our
cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue protocol is the
following:
Protocol P.
• At the beginning we set period t = 0
• a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not
been proposed before, considering Ψk(Pt
)
and Ψk(Pt
) for all players k ∈ A.
• Wait that all players of A give their opinion
(Yes , Ψk(Pt
)) or (No , Ψk(Pt
)) to the
player a. A player k must accept the offer
if Uk(Φk(Pk)) ≥ ρk(t) where ρk(t) tends to
zero when t grows. Moreover there exists
T such that for all t ≥ T, ρk(t) = 0. If
all players agree on P, this later is chosen.
Otherwise t is incremented and we go back
to previous point.
• If there is no more offer left from P, the
default offer ˜P will be chosen.
