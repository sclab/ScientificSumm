We consider a problem where an agent has several decision
criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k
involved in the negotiation protocol. These decision criteria
enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are 
negotiated. The issues correspond directly or not to the decision
criteria. However, for the example of the crisis management
944 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch 
between the hospitals. These issues are translated to decision
criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and
so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams
and so on. In order to take into account the complexity that
exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria 
decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed
at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive
Choquet integral which is a good compromise between 
versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions
between decision criteria [6].
The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk
1 , . . . , Xk
nk
.
All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the 
introduction of partial utility functions uk
i : Xk
i → [0, 1]. The
[0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding
the values of the attributes. An option x is identified to an
element of Xk
= Xk
1 × · · · × Xk
nk
, with x = (x1, . . . , xnk ).
Then the overall assessment of x is given by
Uk(x) = Hk(uk
1 (x1), . . . , uh
nk
(xnk )) (1)
where Hk : [0, 1]nk → [0, 1] is the aggregation function. The
overall preference relation over Xk
is then
x y ⇐⇒ Uk(x) ≥ Uk(y) .
The two-additive Choquet integral is defined for
(z1, . . . , znk ) ∈ [0, 1]nk by [7]
Hk(z1, . . . , znk ) =

where vk
i is the relative importance of criterion i for agent
k and Ik
i,j is the interaction between criteria i and j, ∧ and
∨ denote the min and max functions respectively. Assume
that zi < zj. A positive interaction between criteria i and
j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive
synergy) [7]. Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i 
conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to
a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of
the relative importance of the criteria taken independently
of the other ones. In other words, the score of z on criterion
j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a
negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts 
substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7]. The
score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on
criterion j.
In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations
corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth
to improve option x w.r.t. Hk on some criteria C ⊆ Nk as
follows
ωC (Hk, x)=
Z 1
0
Hk

(1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\C
´
− Hk(x)
EC (τ, x)
dτ
where ((1−τ)xC +τ, xNk\C ) is the compound act that equals
(1 − τ)xi + τ if i ∈ C and equals xi if i ∈ Nk \ C. Moreover,
EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile
((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\C ). Function ωC (Hk, x) depicts the 
average improvement of Hk when the criteria of coalition A
range from xC to 1C divided by the average effort needed
for this improvement. We generally assume that EC is of
order 1, that is EC (τ, x) = τ
P
i∈C (1 − xi). The expression
of ωC (Hk, x) when Hk is a Choquet integral, is given in [11].
The agent is then recommended to improve of coalition C
for which ωC (Hk, x) is maximum. This recommendation is
very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents
to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while
not revealing their own preference model.
