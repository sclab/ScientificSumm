This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.
Crisis management is a relatively new field of management
and is composed of three types of activities: crisis 
prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared
crisis. The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis
to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the 
crisis actually happens. The operational preparedness includes
strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to 
ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of 
resources to deal with possible emergencies. The management
of declared crisis is the response to - including the 
evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by
minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on
the community and environment and, on a longer term, by
bringing the community"s systems back to normal. In this
paper, we focus on the response part of the management of
declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation
of the injured people in disaster situations. When a crisis
is declared, the plans defined during the operational 
preparedness activity are executed. For disasters, master plans
are executed. These plans are elaborated by the authorities
with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police,
health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.
When a victim is found, several actions follow. First, a
rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is
given first aid on the spot. Then, the victims can be placed
in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical
advanced post. For all victims, a sorter physician - 
generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their
injuries and classifies the victims by pathology. The 
evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take
place after these clinical examinations and classifications.
Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians
contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical
assessments of the most urgent cases. The emergency call
centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in
the hospitals to care for these victims. The physicians are
informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the 
evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according
to the pathologies and the transport modes provided. In
this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based
on three important elements: the examination and 
classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the
transport. In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks,
for instance, some injured people did not receive the 
appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the
emergency call centre did not consider the transport 
constraints and, in particular, the traffic. Therefore, for a large
scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support
the emergency call centre and the physicians in the 
dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport 
constraints and availabilities.
