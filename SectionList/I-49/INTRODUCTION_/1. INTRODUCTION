Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important
field of study since negotiation problems in the real world
are often complex ones involving multiple issues. To date,
most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt 
almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving 
independent issues. However, real-world negotiation problems 
involve complex dependencies between multiple issues. When
one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given
car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort
and so on. The addition of such interdependencies greatly
complicates the agents utility functions and classical 
utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient
to model this kind of preferences. In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the
authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most 
often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can
deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks
to the modelling power of the Choquet integral. In [17],
the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are 
interested in a multilateral negotiation setting. Klein et al.
[10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator
too and information about the strength of the approval or
rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation. In
our protocol, we use more precise information to improve
the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and
tools used to model the preferences of our agents. Lin, in [14,
20], also presents a mediation service but using an 
evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained
in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly
interact with each other until the stable state is reached.
As the population size increases, the time it takes for the
population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive
computation, communication, and time overheads that can
become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many
negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of
players increases. In [9], the authors consider a non-linear
utility function by using constraints on the domain of the
issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids
maximizing the social welfare. Our preference model, a 
nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since
the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and
the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the
dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine
the utility. We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to
find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.
In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for
multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into 
account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and
recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.
Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using
a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take
into account information about the improvements that can
be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the
search for a consensus between the agents. Therefore, we
propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our 
decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision
aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based
multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol. This protocol
is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown

that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents
behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and 
Morgenstern. The approach proposed in this paper has been first
introduced and presented in [8]. In this paper, we present
our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a
more complex multi-agent system with representatives to
enable us to have a more robust system.
In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis 
management problem. Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the
proposed approach. The preference modelling is described
in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are 
considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in
sect. 6. Section 7 presents the formal modelling and 
properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments
in sect. 8. Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present
the future work.
