The selective-sharing mechanism presented in this paper does
not make any assumptions about the format of the data used or
about the structure of the distribution function of the parameter to
be estimated. It is computationally lightweight and very simple to
execute. Selective-sharing allows an agent to benefit from other
agents" observations in scenarios in which data sources of the same
type are available. It also guarantees, as a fallback, performance
equivalent to that of a self-learner when the information source is
unique. Furthermore, selective-sharing does not require any prior
knowledge about the types of information sources available in the
environment or of the number of agents associated with each type.
The results of our simulations demonstrate the selective-sharing
mechanism"s effectiveness in improving the estimation produced
for probabilistic parameters based on a limited set of observations.
Furthermore, most of the improvement is achieved in initial 
interactions, which is of great importance for agents operating in
fast-paced environments. Although we tested the selective-sharing
mechanism in the context of the Coordinators project, it is 
applicable in any MAS environment having the characteristics of a
fast-paced environment (e.g., rescue environments). Evidence for
its general effectiveness is given in the general evaluation section,
where environments were continuously randomly generated.
The Wilcoxon statistic used as described in this paper to provide
a classifier for similarity between users provides high flexibility
with low computational costs and is applicable for any 
characteristic being learned. Its use provides a good measure of similarity
which an agent can use to decide how much external information
to adopt for its assessments.
