Argumentation frameworks for multi-agent systems can be used
for different purposes like joint deliberation, persuasion, 
negotiation, and conflict resolution. In this paper we will present an 
argumentation framework for learning agents, and show that it can be
used for two purposes: (1) joint deliberation, and (2) learning from
communication.
Argumentation-based joint deliberation involves discussion over
the outcome of a particular situation or the appropriate course of 
action for a particular situation. Learning agents are capable of 
learning from experience, in the sense that past examples (situations and
their outcomes) are used to predict the outcome for the situation
at hand. However, since individual agents experience may be 
limited, individual knowledge and prediction accuracy is also limited.
Thus, learning agents that are capable of arguing their individual
predictions with other agents may reach better prediction accuracy
after such an argumentation process.
Most existing argumentation frameworks for multi-agent 
systems are based on deductive logic or some other deductive logic
formalism specifically designed to support argumentation, such as
default logic [3]). Usually, an argument is seen as a logical 
statement, while a counterargument is an argument offered in opposition
to another argument [4, 13]; agents use a preference relation to 
resolve conflicting arguments. However, logic-based argumentation
frameworks assume agents with preloaded knowledge and 
preference relation. In this paper, we focus on an Argumentation-based
Multi-Agent Learning (AMAL) framework where both knowledge
and preference relation are learned from experience. Thus, we 
consider a scenario with agents that (1) work in the same domain using
a shared ontology, (2) are capable of learning from examples, and
(3) communicate using an argumentative framework.
Having learning capabilities allows agents effectively use a 
specific form of counterargument, namely the use of 
counterexamples. Counterexamples offer the possibility of agents learning 
during the argumentation process. Moreover, learning agents allow
techniques that use learnt experience to generate adequate 
arguments and counterarguments. Specifically, we will need to address
two issues: (1) how to define a technique to generate arguments
and counterarguments from examples, and (2)how to define a 
preference relation over two conflicting arguments that have been 
induced from examples.
This paper presents a case-based approach to address both 
issues. The agents use case-based reasoning (CBR) [1] to learn from
past cases (where a case is a situation and its outcome) in order
to predict the outcome of a new situation. We propose an 
argumentation protocol inside the AMAL framework at supports agents
in reaching a joint prediction over a specific situation or problem
- moreover, the reasoning needed to support the argumentation
process will also be based on cases. In particular, we present two
case-based measures, one for generating the arguments and 
counterarguments adequate to a particular situation and another for 
determining preference relation among arguments. Finally, we 
evaluate (1) if argumentation between learning agents can produce a
joint prediction that improves over individual learning performance
and (2) if learning from the counterexamples conveyed during the
argumentation process increases the individual performance with
precisely those cases being used while arguing among them.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the 
relation among argumentation, collaboration and learning. Then 
Section 3 introduces our multi-agent CBR (MAC) framework and the
notion of justified prediction. After that, Section 4 formally 
defines our argumentation framework. Sections 5 and 6 present our
case-based preference relation and argument generation policies 
respectively. Later, Section 7 presents the argumentation protocol in
our AMAL framework. After that, Section 8 presents an 
exemplification of the argumentation framework. Finally, Section 9 presents
an empirical evaluation of our two main hypotheses. The paper
closes with related work and conclusions sections.
