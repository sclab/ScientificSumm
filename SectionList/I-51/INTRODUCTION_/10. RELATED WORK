Concerning CBR in a multi-agent setting, the first research was
on negotiated case retrieval [11] among groups of agents. Our
work on multi-agent case-based learning started in 1999 [6]; later
Mc Ginty and Smyth [7] presented a multi-agent collaborative CBR
approach (CCBR) for planning. Finally, another interesting 
approach is multi-case-base reasoning (MCBR) [5], that deals with

distributed systems where there are several case bases available for
the same task and addresses the problems of cross-case base 
adaptation. The main difference is that our MAC approach is a way to
distribute the Reuse process of CBR (using a voting system) while
Retrieve is performed individually by each agent; the other 
multiagent CBR approaches, however, focus on distributing the Retrieve
process.
Research on MAS argumentation focus on several issues like a)
logics, protocols and languages that support argumentation, b) 
argument selection and c) argument interpretation. Approaches for
logic and languages that support argumentation include defeasible
logic [4] and BDI models [13]. Although argument selection is a
key aspect of automated argumentation (see [12] and [13]), most 
research has been focused on preference relations among arguments.
In our framework we have addressed both argument selection and
preference relations using a case-based approach.
