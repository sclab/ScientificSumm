Query suggestion is a functionality to help users of a search
engine to better specify their information need, by narrowing
down or expanding the scope of the search with synonymous
queries and relevant queries, or by suggesting related queries that
have been frequently used by other users. Search engines, such as
Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, all have implemented query
suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search
method. In addition, the same technology has been leveraged to
recommend bidding terms to online advertiser in the 
pay-forperformance search market [12].
Query suggestion is closely related to query expansion which
extends the original query with new search terms to narrow the
scope of the search. But different from query expansion, query
suggestion aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated
by users so that the query integrity and coherence are preserved in
the suggested queries.
Typical methods for query suggestion exploit query logs and
document collections, by assuming that in the same period of
time, many users share the same or similar interests, which can be
expressed in different manners [12, 14, 26]. By suggesting the
related and frequently used formulations, it is hoped that the new
query can cover more relevant documents. However, all of the
existing studies dealt with monolingual query suggestion and to
our knowledge, there is no published study on cross-lingual query
suggestion (CLQS). CLQS aims to suggest related queries but in a
different language. It has wide applications on World Wide Web:
for cross-language search or for suggesting relevant bidding terms
in a different language. 1
CLQS can be approached as a query translation problem, i.e., to
suggest the queries that are translations of the original query.
Dictionaries, large size of parallel corpora and existing
commercial machine translation systems can be used for
translation. However, these kinds of approaches usually rely on
static knowledge and data. It cannot effectively reflect the quickly
shifting interests of Web users. Moreover, there are some
problems with translated queries in target language. For instance,
the translated terms can be reasonable translations, but they are
not popularly used in the target language. For example, the French
query aliment biologique is translated into biologic food by
Google translation tool2
, yet the correct formulation nowadays
should be organic food. Therefore, there exist many mismatch
cases between the translated terms and the really used terms in
target language. This mismatch makes the suggested terms in the
target language ineffective.
A natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the
queries in the source language and the queries in the target
language, by using the query log of a search engine. We exploit
the fact that the users of search engines in the same period of time
have similar interests, and they submit queries on similar topics in
different languages. As a result, a query written in a source
language likely has an equivalent in a query log in the target
language. In particular, if the user intends to perform CLIR, then
original query is even more likely to have its correspondent
included in the target language query log. Therefore, if a
candidate for CLQS appears often in the query log, then it is more
likely the appropriate one to be suggested.
In this paper, we propose a method of calculating the similarity
between source language query and the target language query by
exploiting, in addition to the translation information, a wide
spectrum of bilingual and monolingual information, such as term
co-occurrences, query logs with click-through data, etc. A
discriminative model is used to learn the cross-lingual query
similarity based on a set of manually translated queries. The
model is trained by optimizing the cross-lingual similarity to best
fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other
query"s translation. Besides being benchmarked as an independent
module, the resulting CLQS system is tested as a new means of
query translation in CLIR task on TREC collections. The results
show that this new translation method is more effective than the
traditional query translation method.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
introduces the related work; Section 3 describes in detail the
discriminative model for estimating cross-lingual query similarity;
Section 4 presents a new CLIR approach using cross-lingual query
suggestion as a bridge across language boundaries. Section 5
discusses the experiments and benchmarks; finally, the paper is
concluded in Section 6.
