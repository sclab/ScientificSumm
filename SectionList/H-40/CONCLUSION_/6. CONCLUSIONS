In this paper, we proposed a new approach to cross-lingual query
suggestion by mining relevant queries in different languages from
query logs. The key solution to this problem is to learn a 
crosslingual query similarity measure by a discriminative model
exploiting multiple monolingual and bilingual resources. The
model is trained based on the principle that cross-lingual
similarity should best fit the monolingual similarity between one
query and the other query"s translation.

The baseline CLQS system applies a typical query translation
approach, using a bilingual dictionary with co-occurrence-based
translation disambiguation. This approach only covers 10% of the
relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system (when the exact
translation of the original query is given). By leveraging
additional resources such as parallel corpora, web mining and 
logbased monolingual query expansion, the final system is able to
cover 42% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system
with precision as high as 79.6%.
To further test the quality of the suggested queries, CLQS system
is used as a query translation system in CLIR tasks.
Benchmarked using TREC 6 French to English CLIR task, CLQS
demonstrates higher effectiveness than the traditional query
translation methods using either bilingual dictionary or
commercial machine translation tools.
The improvement on TREC French to English CLIR task by
using CLQS demonstrates the high quality of the suggested
queries. This also shows the strong correspondence between the
input French queries and English queries in the log. In the future,
we will build CLQS system between languages which may be
more loosely correlated, e.g., English and Chinese, and study the
CLQS performance change due to the less strong correspondence
among queries in such languages.
