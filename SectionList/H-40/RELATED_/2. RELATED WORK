Most approaches to CLIR perform a query translation followed by
a monolingual IR. Typically, queries are translated either using a
bilingual dictionary [22], a machine translation software [9] or a
parallel corpus [20].
Despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words and translation disambiguation are the two major
bottlenecks for CLIR [20]. In [7, 27], OOV term translations are
mined from the Web using a search engine. In [17], bilingual
knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis. In addition,
word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been
leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19].

Nevertheless, it is arguable that accurate query translation may
not be necessary for CLIR. Indeed, in many cases, it is helpful to
introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any
query word, but are closely related to the meaning of the query.
This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query
expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18]. [2] reports the
enhancement on CLIR by post-translation expansion. [16]
develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the 
crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts. [18] makes
performance comparison on multiple CLQE techniques, including
pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion.
However, there is lack of a unified framework to combine the
wide spectrum of resources and recent advances of mining
techniques for CLQE.
CLQS is different from CLQE in that it aims to suggest full
queries that have been formulated by users in another language.
As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for
most user queries, we can find common formulations on these
topics in the query log in the target language. Therefore, CLQS
also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the
common formulations of similar topics in the target language.
Query logs have been successfully used for monolingual IR [8,
12, 15, 26], especially in monolingual query suggestions [12] and
relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion [8,
15]. In [1], the target language query log has been exploited to
help query translation in CLIR.
