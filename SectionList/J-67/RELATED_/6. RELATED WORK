In this section we describe related work other than the
two papers ([4] and [15]) on which this paper is based. 
Recent work related to this scheduling domain has focused on
competitive analysis in which the online algorithm uses a
faster processor than the oﬄine algorithm (see, e.g., [13,
14]). Mechanism design was also applied to a scheduling
problem in [18]. In their model, the center owns the jobs
in an oﬄine setting, and it is the agents who can execute
them. The private information of an agent is the time it will
require to execute each job. Several incentive compatible
mechanisms are presented that are based on approximation
algorithms for the computationally infeasible optimization
problem. This paper also launched the area of 
algorithmic mechanism design, in which the mechanism must 
sat69
isfy computational requirements in addition to the standard
incentive requirements. A growing sub-field in this area is
multicast cost-sharing mechanism design (see, e.g., [1]), in
which the mechanism must efficiently determine, for each
agent in a multicast tree, whether the agent receives the
transmission and the price it must pay. For a survey of
this and other topics in distributed algorithmic mechanism
design, see [9].
Online execution presents a different type of algorithmic
challenge, and several other papers study online algorithms
or mechanisms in economic settings. For example, [5] 
considers an online market clearing setting, in which the 
auctioneer matches buy and sells bids (which are assumed to be
exogenous) that arrive and expire over time. In [2], a 
general method is presented for converting an online algorithm
into an online mechanism that is incentive compatible with
respect to values. Truthful declaration of values is also 
considered in [3] and [16], which both consider multi-unit online
auctions. The main difference between the two is that the
former considers the case of a digital good, which thus has
unlimited supply. It is pointed out in [16] that their results
continue to hold when the setting is extended so that bidders
can delay their arrival.
The only other paper we are aware of that addresses the
issue of incentive compatibility in a real-time system is [11],
which considers several variants of a model in which the
center allocates bandwidth to agents who declare both their
value and their arrival time. A dominant strategy IC 
mechanism is presented for the variant in which every point in time
is essentially independent, while a Bayes-Nash IC 
mechanism is presented for the variant in which the center"s 
current decision affects the cost of future actions.
