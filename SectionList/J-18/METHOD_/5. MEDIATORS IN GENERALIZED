NEXTPRICE POSITION AUCTIONS
In the previous section we discussed the implementation
of the VCG outcome function in the next price position 
auction. In this section we deal with a more general family of
position auctions, in which the payment of each player who
has been assigned a position, is a function of the bids of
players assigned to lower positions than his own. The
payment scheme p of such a position auction satisfies the
following condition:
N1: For every j ∈ K and every b1
, b2
∈ B such that b1
(l) =
b2
(l) for every l > j, we have that pj(b1
) = pj(b2
).
We next provide sufficient conditions for implementing the
VCG outcome function by a valid mediator in position 
auctions whose payment schemes satisfy N1.
We need the following notation and definition. For every
position auction G and every b ∈ B let ϕG
(b) = (s(b), q(b)).
We say that G is a V CG cover if for every v ∈ V there
exists b ∈ B such that ϕG
(b) = ϕvcg
(v).
We say that G is monotone if pj(b) ≥ pj(b ) for every
j ∈ K and for every b ≥ b , where b ≥ b if and only if
bi ≥ bi for every i ∈ N.
We are now able to show:
Theorem 3. Let G = G(α, p) be a position auction such
that p satisfies N1. If the following conditions hold then
there exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg
in G:
1. G is a V CG cover
2. G is monotone.
The proof of Theorem 3 is given in the full version. We
next provide the construction of the valid mediator, which
will implement the VCG outcome function in a position 
auction G, which satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3:
Algorithm for building m for G:
• For every v ∈ V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is
some bid profile such that ϕG
(b(v)) = ϕvcg
(v)
• For every i and for every v−i ∈ V−i, let
vi
= (v−i, M(v−i)), where M(v−i) = 1 + maxj=ivj.
• For every i ∈ N and every v−i ∈ V−i, let mN\{i}(v−i) =
b−i(vi
), where b(vi
) is some bid profile such that
ϕG
(b(vi
)) = ϕvcg
(vi
).
• For every S ⊆ N, such that 1 ≤ |S| ≤ n − 2, let
mS(vS) = vS.
Remark: As we wrote, Theorem 3 applies in particular
to next-price position auctions discussed in Section 4. 
However, this Theorem applies to many other interesting 
position auctions as will be shown later. Moreover, the mediator
constructed for this general case is different from the one in
the proof of Theorem 2.
We now show that condition N1 as well as the 
requirement that G is a V CG cover, and the requirement that G
is monotone are all necessary for establishing our result. It
is easy to see that if G is not a V CG cover then Theorem
3 does not hold. The following example shows the necessity
of the monotonicity condition.
Example 4. Let G = G(α, p) be the following position
auction. Let n = 4, m = 3, α = (100, 10, 1), p1(b) = b(2) −
b(3) and p2(b) =
b(3)+b(4)
2
, and p3(b) = b(4). Notice that G
is not monotone. Observe that condition N1 is satisfied. In
the full version we show that G is a V CG cover, and it is
not possible to implement the VCG outcome function in G
with a valid mediator.
The next example shows that Theorem 3 does not hold,
when condition N1 is not satisfied.
Example 5. Let G = G(α, p) be the following position
auction. Let N = {1, 2, 3}, K = {1, 2} and α = (2, 1). Let
p1(b) =
b(1)
4
and p2(b) = b(2). It is immediate to see that the
monotonicity condition is satisfied. We next show that G is
a V CG cover. Let v ∈ V be an arbitrary valuation vector.
We need to find a bid profile b(v) such that ϕG
(b(v)) =
ϕvcg
(v). Note that pvcg
1 (v) =
v(2)+v(3)
2
and pvcg
2 (v) = v(3).
We define the bid profile b(v) as follows.
Let bδ(v,3)(v) =
v(3)
2
, bδ(v,2)(v) = v(3) and bδ(v,1)(v) =
2v2 + 2v(3).
By the construction of b(v), s(b(v), i) = s(v, i) for i =
1, 2, 3 . In addition observe that pj(b(v)) = pvcg
j (v) for
j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore ϕG
(b(v)) = ϕvcg(v). Since v is
arbitrary, G is a V CG cover.
Naturally N1 is not satisfied. Suppose in negation that
there exists a valid mediator m, which implements the VCG
outcome function in G. Consider the following vector of
valuations v = (12, 10, 8). If all players use the mediator
then player 2 (with valuation 10) gets position 2, pays 8, and
therefore her utility is 1(10−8) = 2. Player 2 can always bid
more than the other players, and by that cause some other
player to be positioned second; Since the mediator is required
to be valid it must be that the mediator submits not more
than 12 on behalf of both players 1 and 3. But then player
2 can bid 13, and win the first position; therefore, player 2"s
utility will be 2(10 − 13
4
) > 8. This contradicts that m is a
valid mediator that implements the VCG outcome function
in G.
To summarize, we have shown sufficient conditions for
transforming a large class of position auctions to the V CG
284
position auction by mediation. Moreover by dropping any
of our conditions we get that such transformation might not
be feasible.
In the next subsections we provide classes of interesting
position auctions which can be transformed to the VCG 
position auction by mediation. These auctions satisfy the 
conditions of Theorem 3. However, in order to use Theorem 3
one has to check that a certain position auction, G is a VCG
cover. In the full version paper, before we apply this 
theorem we present another useful theorem that gives sufficient
conditions guaranteeing that G is a VCG cover.
5.1 Generalized next-price position auctions
In a generalized next-price auction the payment scheme is
of the following form. For every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B
pj(b) = b(l(j)) where l(j) is an integer such that l(j) > j.9
.
We show:
Proposition 1. Let G be a generalized next-price 
position auction. There exists a valid mediator that implements
ϕvcg
in G if and only if the following two conditions hold:
(i) l(j + 1) > l(j) for j = 1, ..., m − 1, and (ii) l(m) ≤ n.
5.2 K-next-price position auctions
In k-next-price position auctions the payment scheme is
defined as follows: For every j ∈ K and for every b pj(b) =
b(j+k). K-next-price position auctions are, in particular 
generalized next-price position auctions. Therefore Proposition
1 yields as a corollary:
Proposition 2. Let k ≥ 1. Let G be a k-next-price 
position auction. There exists a valid mediator that implements
ϕvcg
in G if and only if n ≥ m + k − 1.
5.3 Weighted next-price position auctions
In weighted next-price position auctions the payment schemes
are of the following form. For every j ∈ K and for every
b ∈ B, pj(b) =
b(j+1)
cj
, where cj ≥ 1.
Proposition 3. Let G be a weighted next-price position
auction with the weights c1, c2, ..., cm. There exists a valid
mediator that implements ϕvcg
in G if and only if c1 ≥ · · · ≥
cm.
5.4 Google-like position auctions
Google-like ad auctions are slightly different from 
nextprice auction. In these auctions the click-trough rate of an
ad i in position j is the product of the quality of ad i,
βi > 0, and the position click-trough rate αj > 0.10
Players
are ranked in the positions by biβi.
Let b ∈ B. Let ˜δ(b, j) be defined as follows. For every
j ∈ K, let ˜δ(b, j) be the player i that obtains position j,
and for j = m let ˜δ(b, j) = i, where i obtained position m
in case there is more than one player i such that bi = b(m),
then i is chosen between them via the breaking rule ˜γ.
If player i obtains position j ∈ K then she pays pj(b) =
β˜δ(b,j+1)
b˜δ(b,j+1)
βi
. Therefore player i"s utility will be
αjβi(vi −
b˜δ(b,j+1)
βi
β˜δ(b,j+1)) = αj(viβi − b˜δ(b,j+1)β˜δ(b,j+1)).
9
Recall that b(j) = 0 for every j > n
10
See e.g. [17].
Hence by denoting ˜vi = viβi for every i ∈ N, and by 
applying Theorem 2 we obtain:
Proposition 4. There exists a valid mediator which 
implements the VCG outcome function in the Google-like 
position auction.
