AUCTIONS
We now show that there exists a valid mediator, which 
implements the VCG outcome function in next-price position
auctions. Although in the following section we prove a more
general result, we present this result first, given the 
importance of next-price position auctions in the literature and
in practice. Our proof makes use of the following technical
lemma.
Lemma 1. Let pvcg
be the VCG payment scheme.
1. pvcg
j (b) ≤ b(j+1) for every j ∈ K.
2. pvcg
j (b) ≥ pvcg
j+1(b) for every j = 1, ..., m − 1 and for
every b ∈ B, where for every j, equality holds if and
only if b(j+1) = b(j+2) = · · · = b(m+1).
The proof of Lemma 1 is given in the full version. We can
now show:
Theorem 2. Let G be a next-price position auction. There
exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg
in G.
Theorem 2 follows from a more general theorem given in the
next section. However, we still provide a proof since a more
simple and intuitive mediator is constructed for this case.
Proof of Theorem 2. We define a mediator m, which will
implement the VCG outcome function in G: For every v ∈
V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is defined as follows:
For every player i such that 2 ≤ s(v, i) ≤ m let bi(v) =
pvcg
s(v,i)−1(v).8
For every i ∈ δ(v, m + 1), bi(v) = pvcg
m (v).
Let bδ(v,1)(v) = 1 + max{i:s(v,i)≥2}bi(v).
For every S ⊆ N such that S = N and for every vS ∈ VS
let mS(v) = vS. This completes the description of the
mediator m.
We show that ϕm
(v) = ϕvcg
(v) for every v ∈ V . Let
v ∈ V be an arbitrary valuation vector.
We have to show that s(b(v)) = s(v) and that q(b(v)) =
qvcg
(v):
We begin by showing that s(b(v)) = s(v). It is sufficient
to show that whenever 1 ≤ s(v, i) < s(v, l) ≤ m + 1 for
some i = l, then s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
We first show it for s(v, i) = 1, that is δ(v, 1) = i. In
this case bδ(v,1)(v) > bj(v) for every j = i, s(b(v), i) = 1.
Therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l). If s(v, i) > 1, we 
distinguish between two cases.
1. vi = vl. Since s(v, i) < s(v, l), the fixed priority rule
implies that i < l. By the second part of Lemma 1,
pvcg
s(v,i)−1(v) ≥ pvcg
s(v,l)−1(v). Therefore bi(v) ≥ bl(v),
which yields s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
2. vi > vl. Let j + 1 = s(v, i). That is v(j+1) = vi, and
therefore by the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg
s(v,i)−1(v) >
pvcg
s(v,i)(v). Since s(v, i) ≤ s(v, l) − 1, by the second
part of Lemma 1, pvcg
s(v,i)(v) ≥ pvcg
s(v,l)−1(v). 
Therefore pvcg
s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg
s(v,l)−1(v), which yields bi(v) >
bl(v). Therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
This completes the proof that s(b(v)) = s(v) for all v ∈ V .
Observe that for every player i such that s(b(v), i) ∈ K
ps(b(v),i)(b(v)) = pvcg
s(v,i)(v).
Therefore qi(b(v)) = qvcg
i (v) for every i ∈ N. This shows
that q(b(v)) = qvcg
(v) for all v ∈ V . Hence, ϕm
= ϕvcg
.
We proceed to prove that the T-strategy is an ex-post
equilibrium. Note that by the truthfulness of VCG, it is not
beneficial for any player i to miss report her value to the
mediator, given that all other players use the T-strategy.
Next we show that it is not beneficial for a single player i ∈
N to participate in the auction directly if all other players
use the T-strategy. Fix some v ∈ V . Assume that player i
is the only player that participates directly in the auction.
Hence, v−i is the vector of bids submitted by the mediator.
Let bi be player i"s bid. Let k = s(v, i). Therefore, since
ϕm
= ϕvcg
, s(b(v), i) = k. Let j be player i"s position in the
deviation. Hence j = s((v−i, bi), i). If j /∈ K then player i"s
8
Recall that s(b, i) denotes the position of player i under the
bid profile b, and δ(b, j) denotes the set of players assigned
to position j. Whenever j ∈ K, we slightly abuse notations,
and also refer to δ(b, j) as the player that is assigned to
position j.

utility is zero and therefore deviating is not worthwhile for
i. Suppose j ∈ K. Then
αk(vi − pk(b(v))) = αk(vi − pvcg
k (v)) ≥
αj(vi − pvcg
j (v−i, bi)) ≥ αj(vi − v(j+1)),
where the first equality follows from ϕm
= ϕvcg
, the first
inequality follows since VCG is truthful, and the second 
inequality follows from the first part of Lemma 1. Since pj
is position j"s payment function in the next-price position
auction, αj(vi − v(j+1)) = αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)). Therefore
αk(vi − pk(b(v))) ≥ αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)).
Hence, player i does not gain from participating directly in
the auction.
Finally we show that m is valid. If all players choose
the mediator then by the first part of Lemma 1 each player
which uses the T-strategy will not pay more than his value.
Consider the situation in which a subset of players, S, 
participate directly in the auction. Since the mediator submits
the reported values on behalf of the other players, these
other players will not pay more than their reported values.
Hence a player which used the T-strategy will not pay more
than his value. 2
