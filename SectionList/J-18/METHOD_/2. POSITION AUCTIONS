In a position auction there is a seller who sells a finite
number of positions j ∈ K = {1, ..., m}. There is a finite
number of (potential) bidders i ∈ N = {1, ..., n}. We assume
that there are more bidders than positions, i.e. n > m.
The positions are sold for a fixed period of time. For each
position j there is a commonly-known number αj > 0, which
is interpreted as the expected number of visitors at that
position. αj is called the click-through rate of position j.
We assume that α1 > α2 > αm > 0. If i holds a position
then every visitor to this position gives i a revenue of vi > 0,
where vi is called the valuation of i. The set of possible
valuations of i is Vi = (0, ∞).
We assume that the players" utility functions are 
quasilinear. That is, if player i is assigned to position j and pays
pi per click then his utility is αj(vi − pi).
Every player is required to submit a bid, bi ∈ Bi = [0, ∞).
We assume that bidding 0 is a symbol for non-participation.
Therefore, a player with a bid 0 is not assigned to any 
position, and it pays 0.
In all position auctions we consider, the player with the
highest positive bid receives the first position, the player
with the second highest positive bid receives the second 
position, and so on. It is useful to define for every position
auction two dummy positions m + 1 and −1, which more
than one player may be assigned to. All players, who 
participate in the auction but do not get a position in K are
assigned to position m + 1 and all players who choose not
to participate are assigned to position −1. We also define
αm+1 = α−1 = 0.
An assignment of players to positions is called an 
allocation. Hence, an allocation is a vector s = (s1, s2, · · · , sn)
with si ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} such that if si ∈ K then si = sl
for every l = i; si is the position of player i. Given the
above, a position auction is defined by its tie breaking rule,
which determines the allocation in case of ties, and by its
payment scheme. These are discussed below.
2.1 Tie breaking rules
In practice, the most commonly used tie breaking rule
is the First-Arrival rule: if a set of players submit the same
bid, their priority in receiving the positions is determined by
the times their bids were recorded; An earlier bid receives
a higher priority. In auction theory this tie breaking rule is
typically modelled by assuming that the auctioneer is using
a random priority rule. More specifically, let Γ be the set of
all permutations, γ = (γ1, ..., γn) of N. Every such γ defines
a priority rule as follows: i has a higher priority than k if and
only if γi < γk. Every vector of bids b and a permutation
γ uniquely determine an allocation. An auctioneer who is
using the random priority rule chooses a fixed priority rule
γ by randomizing uniformly over Γ. However, the resulting
priority rule is not told to the players before they make their
bids. When the priority rule γ is told to the players before
they make their bids, the tie breaking rule is called a fixed
priority rule. Dealing with a fixed priority rule simplifies
notations and proofs, and in most cases, and in particular
in this paper, results that are obtained with this tie breaking
rule are identical to the results obtained with the random
priority rule. Therefore we will assume this tie breaking
rule. In contrast, in Section 7 we discuss a non-standard
approach for analyzing directly the first-arrival tie breaking
rule.
Unless we say specifically otherwise we assume in this 
paper a fixed priority rule.
Without loss of generality we assume that the fixed 
priority rule is defined by the natural order, ˜γ = (1, 2, ..., n).
That is, bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and
only if i < k. Given this fixed priority rule we can make the
following definitions, which apply to all position auctions:
We denote by s(b, i) the position player i is assigned to
when the bid profile is b. The allocation determined by b is
denoted by
s(b) = (s(b, 1), s(b, 2), · · · , s(b, n)).
For every j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} we denote by δ(b, j) the
set of players assigned to position j. Note that for j ∈ K,
δ(b, j) contains at most one player.
2.2 The payment schemes
Let α be a click-trough rate vector. Each position j ∈
K ∪ {−1, m + 1} is associated with a payment function,
pα
j : B → R+, where pα
j (b) is the payment for position j
when the bid profile is b. Naturally we assume that pα
−1
is identically zero. However, we also assume that pα
m+1 is
identically zero. Hence, a participant who is not assigned a
real position pays nothing.
We call the vector of payment functions pα
= (pα
j )j∈K the
position payment scheme.
Remark: Whenever α is fixed or its value is clear from the
context we will allow ourselves to omit the superscript α
from the payment and other functions.
We deal with anonymous position payment schemes, i.e.
the players" payments to the auctioneer are not influenced
by their identities. This is modeled as follows: Let b ∈ B =
B1 × B2 × · · · × Bn be a bid profile. We denote by b(j) the
jth
highest bid in b. For j > n we let b(j) = 0. For example
if b = (3, 7, 3, 0, 2) then b(1) = 7, b(2) = 3, b(3) = 3, b(4) =
2, b(5) = 0. We denote b∗
= (b(1), · · · , b(n)). Anonymity is
modeled by the requirement that for every two bid profiles
b, d ∈ B, p(b) = p(d) whenever b∗
= d∗
. That is, for
every position j there exists a real-valued function ˜pj defined
over all ordered vectors of bids such that for every b ∈ B
pj(b) = ˜pj(b∗
).
We further assume that a player never pays more than
his bid. That is pj(b) ≤ b(j) for every b ∈ B and for every
j ∈ K.
It is convenient in certain cases to describe the payment
functions indexed by the players. Let G be a position 
auction with a position payment scheme p.
For every player i we denote
qi(b) = ps(b,i)(b),
281
and
q(b) = (q1(b), q2(b), · · · qn(b)).
Note that the correspondence p → q is one-to-one. We call q
the player payment scheme. All our assumptions about the
position payment schemes can be transformed to analogous
assumptions about the player payment schemes. For 
convenience, a position auction will be described either by its
position payment scheme or by its player payment scheme.
The utility function for player i, wi : Vi × B → R+ is
defined as follows:
wi(vi, b) = αs(b,i)(vi − qi(b)) = αs(b,i)(vi − ps(b,i)(b)).
2.3 Central position auctions
We next describe the payment schemes of three central
position auctions.
Self-price position auctions: Each player who is assigned
to a position with a positive click-through rate pays his own
bid. That is, for every j ∈ K and every b ∈ B
pj(b) = b(j) (1)
Next-price position auctions: In this auction (run with
a slight variation by Google), every player who is assigned
to a position with a positive click-through rate pays the bid
of the player assigned to the position right after him if there
is such a player, and zero otherwise. That is for every j ∈ K
and for every b ∈ B
pj(b) = b(j+1) (2)
VCG position auctions: In a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
position auction the payment function for position j ∈ K is
defined as follows.6
For every b ∈ B
pvcg
j (b) =
Pm+1
k=j+1 b(k)(αk−1 − αk)
αj
(3)
Note that the VCG position auction is not the next-price
position auction unless there is only one position and α1 = 1.
2.4 Mediators for position auctions
We denote by G = G(α, p) the position auction with
the click-through rate vector α and the payment scheme
p. Recall that the set of types of i is Vi = (0, ∞). Let
V = V1 × V2 × · · · × Vn be the set of profile of types, and for
every S ⊆ N let VS = ×i∈SVi.
A mediator for G is a vector of functions m = (mS)S⊆N ,
where mS : VS → BS. The mediator m generates a 
preBayesian game Gm, which is called the mediated game. In
this game every player i receives his type vi and can either
send a type, ˆvi (not necessarily the true type) to the 
mediator, or send a bid directly to the auction. If S is the set of
players that send a type to the mediator, the mediator bids
on their behalf mS(ˆvS). Hence, the action set of player i in
the mediated game is Bi ∪Vi, where conveniently Vi denotes
both, (0, ∞) , and a copy of (0, ∞), which is disjoint from
6
We use the standard payment function of the VCG 
mechanism. A general VCG mechanism may be obtained from
the standard one by adding an additional payment function
to each player, which depends only on the types of the other
players. Some authors (see e.g., [7]) call the standard VCG
mechanism, the VC mechanism. According to this 
terminology we actually deal with VC position auctions. However,
we decided to use the more common terminology.
Bi. We introduce the following terminology: The T-strategy
for a player in the mediated game is the strategy, in which
this player uses the mediator"s services and reports his true
value to the mediator. The T-strategy profile is the profile of
strategies in which every player is using the T-strategy. The
T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated
game if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of
types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions
hold:
E1: i is not better off when he gives the mediator the right
of play and report a false type. That is, for every ˆvi ∈ Vi
wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i)) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i)).
E2: i is not better off when he bids directly. That is for
every bi ∈ Bi,
wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i)) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\i(v−i))).
Whenever the T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium
in Gm, the mediator m implements an outcome function
in G. This outcome function is denoted by ϕm
, and it is
defined as follows:
ϕm
(v) = (s(mN (v)), q(mN (v)).
Hence, the range of the function ϕm
is the Cartesian product
of the set of allocations with Rn
+.
