ARRIVAL RULE
Let G be a position auction with the first-arrival rule.
Every mediator for G has the ability to determine the order
in which the bids he submits on behalf of the players are
recorded; He can just submit the bids sequentially, waiting
for a confirmation before submitting the next bid. We need
the following notations.
Every order of bidding can be described by some γ ∈ Γ; i
bids before k if and only if γi < γk. Hence, an order of bids
can serve as a priority rule. For every order of bids γ and a
vector of bids b we define s(b, γ, i) as the position assigned
to i. We denote the payment of i when the vector of bids
is b and the order of bidding is γ by qi(b, γ) = ps(b,γ,i)(b),
and we denote wi(vi, b, γ) the utility of i.
A mediator for G should determine the bids of the players
who use its services and also the order of bids as a function
of the reported types. However, all mediators discussed in
this paper will use the same rule to determine the order of
bids: If all players report the vector of types ˆv, the 
mediator uses the order of bids γˆv
, which is defined as follows:
γˆv
i < γˆv
k if and only if ˆvi > ˆvk, or ˆvi = ˆvk and i < k. For
example, if n = 3 and the reported types are ˆv = (6, 7, 6),
then γˆv
= (2, 1, 3). If only a strict subset of the players
use the mediator"s services, the mediator applies the same
order of bids rule to this subset. A mediator for a position
auction with the first arrival rule is therefore defined by a
vector m = (mS)S⊆N . However, such a mediator is called
a directed mediator in order to stress the fact that it 
determines not only the bids but also the order of bids. To
summarize: If all players use the directed mediator m, and
the reported bids are ˆv, then the directed mediator bids
mN (ˆv)i on behalf of i, i receives the position s(ˆv, γˆv
, i),
and pays qi(mN (ˆv), γˆv
). If only the subset S uses the 
mediator"s services, the reported types are ˆvS, and the other
players bid directly b−S then the actual order of bids is not
uniquely determined. If this order is γ then the position
of i ∈ N is s(b, γ, i), and its payment is qi(b, γ), where
b = (mS(ˆvS), b−S). In particular, if every player is using
the T-strategy and the players" profile of types is v, then
the outcome generated by the directed mediator is
ψm
(v) = (s(v, γv
), q(mN (v), γv
).
But why should the players use the T strategy? Assume all
players but i use the T strategy. If player i deviates from the
T strategy by reporting a false type to the directed mediator,
the resulting outcome is well-defined. On the other hand,
when this player sends a bid directly to the auctioneer, the
resulting outcome is not clear, because the order of bids is
not clear.11
A good desired directed mediator would be one that no
player would want to deviate from the T strategy 
independently of the order in which the bids are recorded because
of his deviation. More specifically:
Definition: Let G be a position auction with the 
firstarrival rule, and let m be a directed mediator for G. The
11
It is clear however, that the resulting order γ is consistent
with the well-defined order of bids of N \ i.
T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium with respect to
m if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of
types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions
hold:
F1: i is not better off when he gives the directed mediator
the right of play and reports a false type. That is, for every
ˆvi ∈ Vi
wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i)
) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i), γ(ˆvi,v−i)
).
F2: i is not better off when he bids directly independently
of the resulting order of recorded bids. That is for every
bi ∈ Bi, and for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the
order of bids of members of N \ i resulting from the vector
of types v−i,
wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i)
) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\i(v−i)), γ).
The notion of valid directed mediators is analogously 
defined:
Definition: Let G be a position auction with the 
firstarrival rule. A directed mediator for G is valid, if for every
player, using the T-strategy guarantees a non-negative level
of utility.
Formally, a directed mediator m for G is valid, if for every
player i with type vi, for every subset S ⊆ N such that i ∈ S,
for every vS\i, and for every b−S, wi(vi, mS(vS), b−S, γ) ≥
0 for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the standard
order of bids of S determined by the mediator when the
reported types are vS.
The notion of implementation by mediation remains as
before: The directed mediator m implements the VCG 
outcome function in G if ψm
= ϕvcg
.
Our previous results remain true for directed mediators for
position auctions with the first arrival rule. Next we show
that in contrast to Theorem 6, it is possible to implement the
VCG outcome function in every self-price position auction
with the first-arrival rule.
Theorem 7. Let G = G(α, p) be the self-price position
auction with the first arrival rule. There exists a valid 
directed mediator that implements the VCG outcome function
in G.
In the following theorem we provide sufficient conditions
for implementing that the VCG outcome function in a 
position auction with the first-arrival rule. A special 
characteristic of auctions satisfying these sufficient conditions is
that players" payments may depend also on their own bid,
in contrast to the auctions discussed in Theorem 3. The long
proof of this theorem is in the spirit of all previous proofs,
and therefore it is omitted.
Theorem 8. Let G = G(α, p) be a position auction with
the first-arrival rule. If the following conditions hold then
there exists a valid directed mediator for G that implements
the VCG outcome function in G.
1. For every v ∈ V there exists b ∈ B such that pj(b) =
v(j) for every j ∈ K.
2. G is monotone.
3. pj(b) ≥ pj+1(b) for every j ∈ K and every b ∈ B.
4. For every j ∈ K and every b1
, b2
∈ B such that b1
(l) =
b2
(l) for every l ≥ j, pj(b1
) = pj(b2
).
