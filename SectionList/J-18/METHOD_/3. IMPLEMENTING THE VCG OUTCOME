FUNCTION BY MEDIATION
In general, except for the VCG position auction we do not
expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium.7
Therefore, the behavior of the participants in most position
auctions cannot be analytically predicted, and in practice it
can form a non-efficient allocation: an allocation that does
not maximize social surplus. In contrast, in the VCG 
position auction the truth-reporting strategy is a dominant
strategy for every player, and the resulting allocation is 
efficient. Given a position auction G our goal is to construct a
mediator that would implement the outcome function of the
VCG position auction. This outcome function is defined as
follows:
ϕvcg
(v) = (s(v), qvcg
(v)).
Definition: Let G be a position auction . Let m be a
mediator for G. We say the m implements the VCG outcome
function in G, or that it implements ϕvcg
in G if the 
Tstrategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in Gm, and ϕm
=
ϕvcg
.
We demonstrate our definitions so far by a simple 
example:
Example 1. Consider a self-price auction G = G(α, p)
with 2 players and one position, with α1 = 1. That is, G is
a standard two-person first-price auction. The 
corresponding VCG position auction is a standard second-price 
auction. We define a family of mediators mc
, c ≥ 1, each of
them implements the VCG position auction. Assume both
7
Actually, it can be shown that if a strategy profile b in
a position auction is an ex post equilibrium then for every
player i bi is a dominant strategy. It is commonly 
conjectured that except for some extremely artificial combinatorial
auctions , the VCG combinatorial auctions are the only ones
with dominant strategies (see [10]).

players use the mediator"s services and send him the types
ˆv = (ˆv1, ˆv2), then all mediators act similarly and as follows:
If ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 the mediator makes the following bids on behalf
of the players: b1 = ˆv2, and b2 = 0. If ˆv2 > ˆv1, the mediator
makes the bids b1 = 0, b2 = ˆv1. If only one player uses
the mediator services, say player i, then mediator mc
bids
bi = cˆvi on behalf of i. We claim that for every c > 1, the
T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated
game generated by mc
. Indeed, assume player 2 reports his
type v2 to the mediator, and consider player 1.
If v1 ≥ v2 then by using the T-strategy player 1 receives the
position and pays v2. Hence, 1"s utility is v1 −v2. If player 1
deviates by using the mediator"s services and reporting ˆv1 ≥
v2 his utility is still v1 − v2. If he reports ˆv1 < v2 his utility
will be 0. If player 1 does not use the mediator, he should
bid at least cv2 in order to get the positions, and therefore
his utility cannot exceed v1 − v2.
If v1 < v2, then the T-strategy yields 0 to player 1, and
any other strategy yields a non-positive utility.
Obviously each of the mediators mc
implements the VCG
outcome function. Note however, that the T-strategy is not
a dominant strategy when c > 1; e.g. if v1 > v2 and player
2 bids directly v2 (without using the mediator services), then
bidding directly v1 is better for player 1 than using the 
Tstrategy: in the former case player 1"s utility is 0 and in the
latter case her utility is negative.
It is interesting to note that this simple example can not
be extended to general self-price position auctions, as will
be discussed in section 4.
While each of the mediators mc
in Example 1 implements
the VCG outcome function, the mediator with c = 1 has
a distinct characteristic: a player who uses the T-strategy
cannot get a negative utility. In contrast, for every c > 1, if
say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates
directly and bids less than cv1, then the T-strategy yields a
negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1. This motivates our
definition of valid mediators:
Let G be a position auction. A mediator for G is valid,
if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a 
nonnegative level of utility.
Formally, a mediator m for G, is valid if for every subset
S ⊆ N and every player i ∈ S wi(vi, mS(vS), b−S) ≥ 0 for
every b−S ∈ B−S and every vs ∈ VS.
