Let G be a self-price position auction as described at 
section 2. At example 1 we showed that when there is one
position and two players, the VCG outcome function is 
implemented by a valid mediator in this auction. The proof
in this example can be easily generalized to show that the
VCG outcome function can be implemented by a valid 
mediator in a self-price position auction, in which there is one
position and an arbitrary number of players, n ≥ 2.
Next we show that it is impossible to implement the VCG
outcome function, even by a non-valid mediator, in a 
selfprice position auction which has more than one position
(m > 1).
Theorem 6. Let G be a self-price position auction with
more than one position. There is no mediator that 
implements the VCG outcome function in G.
Proof. Let v ∈ V be the following valuation profile. vn = 10
and v1 = v2 = · · · = vn−1 = 5. The VCG outcome function
assigns to this v an allocation, in which player n receives
position 1 and player 1 receives position 2. The payments of
players n and 1 are both equal to 5. In order to implement
such an outcome, a mediator must bid 5 on behalf of player
n (so that this player pays 5), and it must bid less than 5 on
behalf of any other player, because otherwise another player
receives position 1. Note that the bid of any other player
cannot equal 5 because every other player has an higher
priority than n. In particular, even if player 1 gets indeed
position 2 he will pay less than 5. Hence, no mediator can
implement the VCG outcome function in G.2
The proof of Theorem 6 heavily uses the fixed priority
rule assumption. However, as we have already said, all our
results including this theorem hold also for the tie breaking
rule defined by the random priority rule. The proof of the
impossibility theorem for the random priority rule uses the
fact that the particular bad priority rule used in the proof
of Theorem 6, has a positive probability.
As we previously discussed, the fixed and random 
priority rules are just convenient ways to model the first-arrival
rule, which is common in practice. When one attempts to
directly model position auctions that use the first-arrival
rule without these modeling choices he tackles a lot of 
modeling problems. In particular, it is not clear how to model a
position auction with the first-arrival rule as a game with 
incomplete information. To do this, one has to allow a player
not only to submit a bid but also to decide about the time
of the bid. This raises a lot of additional modeling 
problems, such as determining the relationship between the time
a player decides to submit a bid and the time in which this
bid is actually recorded. Hence, efficient modeling as a game
may be untractable. Nevertheless, in the next section we
will analyze mediators in position auctions, which use the
first-arrival rule. We will define ex post equilibrium and the
notion of implementation by mediation without explicitly
modeling well-defined games. We will show that in this case

there is a way to implement the VCG outcome function in
a self-price position auction. Moreover, we will find a valid
mediator that does the job.
