Before a negotiation starts human negotiators prepare the
dialogic exchanges that can be made along the five LOGIC
dimensions [7]:
• Legitimacy. What information is relevant to the 
negotiation process? What are the persuasive arguments
about the fairness of the options?

• Options. What are the possible agreements we can
accept?
• Goals. What are the underlying things we need or care
about? What are our goals?
• Independence. What will we do if the negotiation fails?
What alternatives have we got?
• Commitment. What outstanding commitments do we
have?
Negotiation dialogues, in this context, exchange 
dialogical moves, i.e. messages, with the intention of getting 
information about the opponent or giving away information
about us along these five dimensions: request for 
information, propose options, inform about interests, issue promises,
appeal to standards . . . A key part of any negotiation process
is to build a model of our opponent(s) along these 
dimensions. All utterances agents make during a negotiation give
away information about their current LOGIC model, that
is, about their legitimacy, options, goals, independence, and
commitments. Also, several utterances can have a 
utilitarian interpretation in the sense that an agent can associate
a preferential gain to them. For instance, an offer may 
inform our negotiation opponent about our willingness to sign
a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, and at the
same time the opponent can compute what is its associated
expected utilitarian gain. These two views: 
informationbased and utility-based, are central in the model proposed
in this paper.
2.1 Intimacy and Balance in relationships
There is evidence from psychological studies that humans
seek a balance in their negotiation relationships. The 
classical view [1] is that people perceive resource allocations as
being distributively fair (i.e. well balanced) if they are 
proportional to inputs or contributions (i.e. equitable). 
However, more recent studies [16, 17] show that humans follow
a richer set of norms of distributive justice depending on
their intimacy level: equity, equality, and need. Equity 
being the allocation proportional to the effort (e.g. the profit
of a company goes to the stock holders proportional to their
investment), equality being the allocation in equal amounts
(e.g. two friends eat the same amount of a cake cooked by
one of them), and need being the allocation proportional to
the need for the resource (e.g. in case of food scarcity, a
mother gives all food to her baby). For instance, if we are in
a purely economic setting (low intimacy) we might request
equity for the Options dimension but could accept equality
in the Goals dimension.
The perception of a relation being in balance (i.e. fair)
depends strongly on the nature of the social relationships
between individuals (i.e. the intimacy level). In purely 
economical relationships (e.g., business), equity is perceived as
more fair; in relations where joint action or fostering of social
relationships are the goal (e.g. friends), equality is perceived
as more fair; and in situations where personal development
or personal welfare are the goal (e.g. family), allocations are
usually based on need.
We believe that the perception of balance in dialogues (in
negotiation or otherwise) is grounded on social relationships,
and that every dimension of an interaction between humans
can be correlated to the social closeness, or intimacy, 
between the parties involved. According to the previous 
studies, the more intimacy across the five LOGIC dimensions the
more the need norm is used, and the less intimacy the more
the equity norm is used. This might be part of our social
evolution. There is ample evidence that when human 
societies evolved from a hunter-gatherer structure1
to a 
shelterbased one2
the probability of survival increased when food
was scarce.
In this context, we can clearly see that, for instance, 
families exchange not only goods but also information and 
knowledge based on need, and that few families would consider
their relationships as being unbalanced, and thus unfair,
when there is a strong asymmetry in the exchanges (a mother
explaining everything to her children, or buying toys, does
not expect reciprocity). In the case of partners there is some
evidence [3] that the allocations of goods and burdens (i.e.
positive and negative utilities) are perceived as fair, or in
balance, based on equity for burdens and equality for goods.
See Table 1 for some examples of desired balances along the
LOGIC dimensions.
The perceived balance in a negotiation dialogue allows 
negotiators to infer information about their opponent, about
its LOGIC stance, and to compare their relationships with
all negotiators. For instance, if we perceive that every time
we request information it is provided, and that no significant
questions are returned, or no complaints about not 
receiving information are given, then that probably means that
our opponent perceives our social relationship to be very
close. Alternatively, we can detect what issues are causing
a burden to our opponent by observing an imbalance in the
information or utilitarian senses on that issue.
