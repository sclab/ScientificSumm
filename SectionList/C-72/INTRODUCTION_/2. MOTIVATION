To estimate the scale of the problem, In-stat predicts that
the number of WiFi-enabled devices sold annually alone will
grow to 430 million by 2009 [2]. Therefore, it would be 
reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment
will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range
of each other. As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and
allocation would become both important and fundamental.
Coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential
due to limited device sensing resolution and physical RF 
effects such as shadowing. Cabric et al. [5] illustrate the gains
from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction
in the probability of interference with the primary user when
only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.
However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the
limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to
communicate this information on short timescales, and (3)
the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.
Limited Bandwidth: Due to restrictions of cost and
power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware
for supporting coordination. This implies that both data
and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a
single radio interface. Therefore, any time spent 
communicating sensory information takes away from the device"s
ability to perform its intended function. Thus, any such
coordination must incur minimal network overhead.
Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem
is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory
data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely 
fashion. This is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes
of the RF environment can occur due to device and obstacle
movements. Here, fading and multi-path interference 
heavily impact sensing abilities. Signal level can drop to a deep
null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm
at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14]. Coordination
which does not support rapid dissemination of information
will not be able to account for such RF variations.
Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can 
potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be 
numerous channels that they need to scan. Suppose we wish to
compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized
frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete
energy levels. Exchanging complete sensory information 
between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for
100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information). 
Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50
devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50 
devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate
network bandwidth.
Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to
disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors
to perform in-network aggregation. By applying gossip and
FM aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to
(c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission)
= 0.40 Mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate
the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1
). This is
explained further in Section 4.
Based on these insights, we propose GUESS, a low-overhead
approach which uses incremental extensions to FM 
aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination
within a cognitive radio network. As we show in Section 7,

Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology
of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment.

these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth
requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard 
approaches discussed above.
