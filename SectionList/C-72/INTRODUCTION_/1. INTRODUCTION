There has recently been a huge surge in the growth of
wireless technology, driven primarily by the availability of
unlicensed spectrum. However, this has come at the cost
of increased RF interference, which has caused the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States to
re-evaluate its strategy on spectrum allocation. Currently,
the FCC has licensed RF spectrum to a variety of public and
private institutions, termed primary users. New spectrum
allocation regimes implemented by the FCC use dynamic
spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or 
opportunistically allocate RF spectrum to unlicensed secondary users

that can use it when the primary user is absent. The second
type of allocation scheme is termed opportunistic spectrum
sharing. The FCC has already legislated this access method
for the 5 GHz band and is also considering the same for
TV broadcast bands [1]. As a result, a new wave of 
intelligent radios, termed cognitive radios (or software defined
radios), is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their 
radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding
environment.
Under the new opportunistic allocation strategy, 
secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary
users (senders or receivers). This can be done by sensing
the environment to detect the presence of primary users.
However, local sensing is not always adequate, especially in
cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary
user, as illustrated in Figure 1. Here, coordination between
secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to 
detect the primary. In general, cooperation improves sensing
accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not
cooperating at all [5].
To realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access, two 
fundamental problems must be solved: (1) Efficient and 
coordinated spectrum sensing and (2) Distributed spectrum 
allocation. In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated
spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales
comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are
resilient to network failures and alterations. We defer the
problem of spectrum allocation to future work.
Spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks
[4, 17] are broadly classified into three regimes; (1) 
centralized coordinated techniques, (2) decentralized coordinated
techniques, and (3) decentralized uncoordinated techniques.
We advocate a decentralized coordinated approach, similar
in spirit to OSPF link-state routing used in the Internet.
This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches 
because making decisions based only on local information is
fallible (as shown in Figure 1). Moreover, compared to 
cen12
tralized approaches, decentralized techniques are more 
scalable, robust, and resistant to network failures and security
attacks (e.g. jamming).
Coordinating sensory data between cognitive radio devices
is technically challenging because accurately assessing 
spectrum usage requires exchanging potentially large amounts of
data with many radios at very short time scales. Data size
grows rapidly due to the large number (i.e. thousands) of
spectrum bands that must be scanned. This data must also
be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring
secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid
changes in the RF environment.
This paper presents GUESS, a novel approach to 
coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks. Our
approach is motivated by the following key observations:
1. Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most 
devices have limited sensing resolution because they are
low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot
perform complex RF signal processing (e.g. matched
filtering). Many are typically equipped with simple
energy detectors that gather only approximate 
information.
2. Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination:
Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are
sufficient for correlating sensed information between
radios, as relative usage information is more 
important than absolute usage data. Thus, exchanging 
exact RF information may not be necessary, and more
importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum
sensing.
3. RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands,
RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently. 
Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that
band and not the entire spectrum. Therefore, if the
usage pattern of a particular band changes 
substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an 
update protocol to update the information for that band
alone, leaving in place information already collected
for other bands. This allows rapid detection of change
while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary
information.
Based on these observations, GUESS makes the following
contributions:
1. A novel approach that applies randomized gossiping 
algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum 
sensing. These algorithms are well suited to coordinated
spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of
the problem: i.e. radios are power-limited, mobile and
have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing
capabilities.
2. An application of in-network aggregation for 
dissemination of spectrum summaries. We argue that 
approximate summaries are adequate for performing accurate
radio parameter tuning.
3. An extension of in-network aggregation and 
randomized gossiping to support incremental maintenance of
spectrum summaries. Compared to standard 
gossiping approaches, incremental techniques can further 
reduce overhead and protocol execution time by 
requiring fewer radio resources.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to
coordinated spectrum sensing. Section 3 discusses related
work in the area, while Section 4 provides a background on
in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping. Sections
5 and 6 discuss extensions and protocol details of these 
techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing. Section 7 presents
simulation results showcasing the benefits of GUESS, and
Section 8 presents a discussion and some directions for 
future work.
