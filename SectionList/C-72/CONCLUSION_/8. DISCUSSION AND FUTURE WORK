We have only just scratched the surface in addressing the
problem of coordinated spectrum sensing using incremental
gossiping. Next, we outline some open areas of research.
Spatial Decay: Devices performing coordinated sensing
are primarily interested in the spectrum usage of their local
neighborhood. Therefore, we recommend the use of 
spatially decaying aggregates [6], which limits the impact of an
update on more distant nodes. Spatially decaying 
aggregates work by successively reducing (by means of a decay
function) the value of the update as it propagates further
from its origin. One challenge with this approach is that
propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time
and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.
Therefore, finding the optimal decay function is non-trivial,
and an interesting subject of future work.
Significance Threshold: RF spectrum bands 
continually experience small-scale changes which may not 
necessarily be significant. Deciding if a change is significant can be
done using a significance threshold β, below which any 
observed change is not propagated by the node. Choosing an
appropriate operating value for β is application dependent,
and explored further in [3].
Weighted Readings: Although we argued that most
devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing 
equipment, there may be situations where there are some special
infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than
others. Weighting their measurements more heavily could
be used to maintain a higher degree of accuracy. 
Determining how to assign such weights is an open area of research.
Implementation Specifics: Finally, implementing 
gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open. If 
implemented at the MAC layer, it may be feasible to piggy-back
gossip messages over existing management frames (e.g. 
networking advertisement messages). As well, we also require
the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing 
information. There are a variety of alternatives for 
implementing such a channel, some of which are outlined in [4]. The
trade-offs of different approaches to implementing GUESS
is a subject of future work.
