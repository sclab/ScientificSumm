Spectrum sensing is a key requirement for dynamic 
spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. The nature of
the RF environment necessitates coordination between 
cognitive radio devices. We propose GUESS, an approximate
yet low overhead approach to perform efficient coordination
between cognitive radios. The fundamental contributions of
GUESS are: (1) an FM aggregation scheme for efficient 
innetwork aggregation, (2) a randomized gossiping approach
which provides exponentially fast convergence and 
robustness to network alterations, and (3) incremental variations
of FM and gossip which we show can reduce the 
communication time by up to a factor of 2.7 and reduce network
overhead by up to a factor of 2.4. Our preliminary 
simulation results showcase the benefits of this approach and we
also outline a set of open problems that make this a new
and exciting area of research.
