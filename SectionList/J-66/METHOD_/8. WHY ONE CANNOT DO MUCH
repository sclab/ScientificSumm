BETTER THAN LINEAR
PROGRAMMING
One may wonder if, for the special cases of the 
DONATIONCLEARING problem that can be solved in polynomial time
with linear programming, there exist special purpose 
algorithms that are much faster than linear programming 
algorithms. In this section, we show that this is not the case.
We give a reduction from (the decision variant of) the 
general linear programming problem to (the decision variant
of) a special case of the DONATION-CLEARING problem
(which can be solved in polynomial time using linear 
programming). (The decision variant of an optimization 
problem asks the binary question: Can the objective value 
exceed o?) Thus, any special-purpose algorithm for solving
the decision variant of this special case of the 
DONATIONCLEARING problem could be used to solve a decision 
question about an arbitrary linear program just as fast. (And
thus, if we are willing to call the algorithm a logarithmic
number of times, we can solve the optimization version of
the linear program.)
We first observe that for linear programming, a decision
question about the objective can simply be phrased as 
another constraint in the LP (forcing the objective to exceed
the given value); then, the original decision question 
coincides with asking whether the resulting linear program has
a feasible solution.
Theorem 3. The question of whether an LP (given by a
set of linear constraints4
) has a feasible solution can be 
modeled as a DONATION-CLEARING instance with payment
maximization as the objective, with 2v charities and v + c
bids (where v is the number of variables in the LP, and c is
the number of constraints). In this model, each bid bj has
only linear ui
j functions, and is a partially acceptable 
threshold bid (wj(u) = tj for u ≥ sj, otherwise wj(u) =
utj
sj
). The
v bids corresponding to the variables mention only two 
charities each; the c bids corresponding to the constraints mention
only two times the number of variables in the corresponding
constraint.
Proof. For every variable xi in the LP, let there be two
charities, c+xi and c−xi . Let H be some number such that
if there is a feasible solution to the LP, there is one in which
every variable has absolute value at most H.
In the following, we will represent bids as follows:
({(ck, ak)}, s, t) indicates that uk
j (πck ) = akπck (this 
function is 0 for ck not mentioned in the bid), and wj(uj) = t
for uj ≥ s, wj(uj) =
uj t
s
otherwise.
For every variable xi in the LP, let there be a bid bxi =
({(c+xi , 1), (c−xi , 1)}, 2H, 2H − c
v
). For every constraint
i
rj
i xi ≤ sj in the linear program, let there be a bid bj =
({(c−xi , rj
i )}i:r
j
i >0
∪ {(c+xi , −rj
i )}i:r

i <0
, (
i

Let the target total amount donated be 2vH.
Suppose there is a feasible solution (x∗
1, x∗
2, . . . , x∗
v) to the
LP. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that |x∗
i | ≤ H
for all i. Then, in the DONATION-CLEARING instance,

These constraints must include bounds on the variables
(including nonnegativity bounds), if any.

for every i, let πc+xi
= H + x∗
i , and let πc−xi
= H − x∗
i
(for a total payment of 2H to these two charities). This
allows us to extract the maximum payment from the bids
bxi -a total payment of 2vH − c. Additionally, the utility
of bidder bj is now

rj
i x∗
i ≥ (
i
|rj
i |)H − sj (where the last 
inequality stems from the fact that constraint j must be 
satisfied in the LP solution), so it follows we can extract the
maximum payment from all the bidders bj, for a total 
payment of c. It follows that we can extract the required 2vH
payment from the bidders, and there exists a solution to
the DONATION-CLEARING instance with a total amount
donated of at least 2vH.
Now suppose there is a solution to the 
DONATIONCLEARING instance with a total amount donated of at
least vH. Then the maximum payment must be extracted
from each bidder. From the fact that the maximum payment
must be extracted from each bidder bxi , it follows that for
each i, πc+xi
+ πc−xi
≥ 2H. Because the maximum 
extractable total payment is 2vH, it follows that for each i,
πc+xi
+ πc−xi
= 2H. Let x∗
i = πc+xi
− H = H − πc−xi
.
Then, from the fact that the maximum payment must be
extracted from each bidder bj, it follows that (
