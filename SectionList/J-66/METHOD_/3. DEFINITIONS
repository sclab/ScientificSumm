Throughout this paper, we will refer to the offers that the
donating parties make as bids, and to the donating parties
as bidders. In our bidding framework, a bid will specify,
for each vector of total payments made to the charities, how
much that bidder is willing to contribute. (The contribution
of this bidder is also counted in the vector of 
paymentsso, the vector of total payments to the charities represents
the amount given by all donating parties, not just the ones
other than this bidder.) The bidding language is expressive
enough that no bidder should have to make more than one
bid. The following definition makes the general form of a
bid in our framework precise.
Definition 1. In a setting with m charities c1, c2, . . . , cm,
a bid by bidder bj is a function vj : Rm
→ R. The 
interpretation is that if charity ci receives a total amount of πci , then
bidder j is willing to donate (up to) vj(πc1 , πc2 , . . . , πcm ).
We now define possible outcomes in our model, and which
outcomes are valid given the bids that were made.
Definition 2. An outcome is a vector of payments made
by the bidders (πb1 , πb2 , . . . , πbn ), and a vector of payments
received by the charities (πc1 , πc2 , . . . , πcm ). A valid 
outcome is an outcome where
1.
n
j=1
πbj ≥
m
i=1
πci (at least as much money is collected
as is given away);
2. For all 1 ≤ j ≤ n, πbj ≤ vj(πc1 , πc2 , . . . , πcm ) (no
bidder gives more than she is willing to).
Of course, in the end, only one of the valid outcomes can
be chosen. We choose the valid outcome that maximizes the
objective that we have for the donation process.
Definition 3. An objective is a function from the set of
all outcomes to R.2
After all bids have been collected, a valid
outcome will be chosen that maximizes this objective.
One example of an objective is surplus, given by
n
j=1
πbj −
m
i=1
πci . The surplus could be the profits of a company
managing the expressive donation marketplace; but, 
alternatively, the surplus could be returned to the bidders, or
given to the charities. Another objective is total amount 
donated, given by
m
i=1
πci . (Here, different weights could also
be placed on the different charities.)
Finding the valid outcome that maximizes the objective
is a (nontrivial) computational problem. We will refer to it
as the clearing problem. The formal definition follows.
Definition 4 (DONATION-CLEARING). We are
given a set of n bids over charities c1, c2, . . . , cm. 
Additionally, we are given an objective function. We are asked to
find an objective-maximizing valid outcome.
How difficult the DONATION-CLEARING problem is 
depends on the types of bids used and the language in which
they are expressed. This is the topic of the next section.

In general, the objective function may also depend on the
bids, but the objective functions under consideration in this
paper do not depend on the bids. The techniques presented
in this paper will typically generalize to objectives that take
the bids into account directly.
