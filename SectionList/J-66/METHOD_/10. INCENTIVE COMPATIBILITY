Up to this point, we have not discussed the bidders" 
incentives for bidding any particular way. Specifically, the bids
may not truthfully reflect the bidders" preferences over 
charities because a bidder may bid strategically, misrepresenting
her preferences in order to obtain a result that is better to
herself. This means the mechanism is not strategy-proof.
(We will show some concrete examples of this shortly.) This
is not too surprising, because the mechanism described so
far is, in a sense, a first-price mechanism, where the 
mechanism will extract as much payment from a bidder as her bid
allows. Such mechanisms (for example, first-price auctions,
where winners pay the value of their bids) are typically not
strategy-proof: if a bidder reports her true valuation for an
outcome, then if this outcome occurs, the payment the 
bidder will have to make will offset her gains from the outcome
completely. Of course, we could try to change the rules of
the game-which outcome (payment vector to charities) do
we select for which bid vector, and which bidder pays how
much-in order to make bidding truthfully beneficial, and
to make the outcome better with regard to the bidders" true
preferences. This is the field of mechanism design. In this
section, we will briefly discuss the options that mechanism
design provides for the expressive charity donation problem.
10.1 Strategic bids under the first-price
mechanism
We first point out some reasons for bidders to misreport
their preferences under the first-price mechanism described
in the paper up to this point. First of all, even when there is
only one charity, it may make sense to underbid one"s true
valuation for the charity. For example, suppose a bidder
would like a charity to receive a certain amount x, but does
not care if the charity receives more than that. Additionally,
suppose that the other bids guarantee that the charity will
receive at least x no matter what bid the bidder submits
(and the bidder knows this). Then the bidder is best off not
bidding at all (or submitting a utility for the charity of 0),
to avoid having to make any payment. (This is known in
economics as the free rider problem [14].
With multiple charities, another kind of manipulation may
occur, where the bidder attempts to steer others" payments
towards her preferred charity. Suppose that there are two
charities, and three bidders. The first bidder bids u1
1(πc1 ) =
1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1
1(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; u2
1(πc2 ) = 1 if πc2 ≥ 1,
u2
1(πc2 ) = 0 otherwise; and w1(u1) = u1 if u1 ≤ 1, w1(u1) =
1+ 1
100
(u1 −1) otherwise. The second bidder bids u1
2(πc1 ) =
1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1
1(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; u2
2(πc2 ) = 0 (always);
w2(u2) = 1
4
u2 if u2 ≤ 1, w2(u2) = 1
4
+ 1
100
(u2 −1) otherwise.
Now, the third bidder"s true preferences are accurately 
represented5
by the bid u1
3(πc1 ) = 1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1
3(πc1 ) = 0
otherwise; u2
3(πc2 ) = 3 if πc2 ≥ 1, u2
3(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise;
and w3(u3) = 1
3
u3 if u3 ≤ 1, w3(u3) = 1
3
+ 1
100
(u3 − 1) 
otherwise. Now, it is straightforward to check that, if the third
bidder bids truthfully, regardless of whether the objective is
surplus maximization or total donated, charity 1 will receive
at least 1, and charity 2 will receive less than 1. The same is
true if bidder 3 does not place a bid at all (as in the previous
type of manipulation); hence bidder 2"s utility will be 1 in
this case. But now, if bidder 3 reports u1
3(πc1 ) = 0 
everywhere; u2
3(πc2 ) = 3 if πc2 ≥ 1, u2
3(πc2 ) = 0 otherwise (this
part of the bid is truthful); and w3(u3) = 1
3
u3 if u3 ≤ 1,
w3(u3) = 1
3
otherwise; then charity 2 will receive at least
1, and bidder 3 will have to pay at most 1
3
. Because up to
this amount of payment, one unit of money corresponds to
three units of utility to bidder 3, it follows his utility is now
at least 3 − 1 = 2 > 1. We observe that in this case, the
strategic bidder is not only affecting how much the bidders
pay, but also how much the charities receive.
10.2 Mechanism design in the quasilinear
setting
There are four reasons why the mechanism design 
approach is likely to be most successful in the setting of 
quasilinear preferences. First, historically, mechanism design has
been been most successful when the quasilinear assumption
could be made. Second, because of this success, some very
general mechanisms have been discovered for the 
quasilinear setting (for instance, the VCG mechanisms [24, 4, 10],
or the dAGVA mechanism [6, 1]) which we could apply 
directly to the expressive charity donation problem. Third, as
we saw in Section 9, the clearing problem is much easier in
5
Formally, this means that if the bidder is forced to pay
the full amount that his bid allows for a particular vector of
payments to charities, the bidder is indifferent between this
and not participating in the mechanism at all. (Compare
this to bidding truthfully in a first-price auction.)
58
this setting, and thus we are less likely to run into 
computational trouble for the mechanism design problem. Fourth, as
we will show shortly, the quasilinearity assumption in some
cases allows for decomposing the mechanism design problem
over the charities (as it did for the simple clearing problem).
Moreover, in the quasilinear setting (unlike in the general
setting), it makes sense to pursue social welfare (the sum
of the utilities) as the objective, because now 1) units of
utility correspond directly to units of money, so that we do
not have the problem of the bidders arbitrarily scaling their
utilities; and 2) it is no longer possible to give a payment
willingness function of 0 while still affecting the donations
through a utility function.
Before presenting the decomposition result, we introduce
some terms from game theory. A type is a preference profile
that a bidder can have and can report (thus, a type report
is a bid). Incentive compatibility (IC) means that bidders
are best off reporting their preferences truthfully; either 
regardless of the others" types (in dominant strategies), or in
expectation over them (in Bayes-Nash equilibrium). 
Individual rationality (IR) means agents are at least as well off
participating in the mechanism as not participating; either
regardless of the others" types (ex-post), or in expectation
over them (ex-interim). A mechanism is budget balanced
if there is no flow of money into or out of the system-in
general (ex-post), or in expectation over the type reports
(ex-ante). A mechanism is efficient if it (always) produces
the efficient allocation of wealth to charities.
Theorem 7. Suppose all agents" preferences are 
quasilinear. Furthermore, suppose that there exists a single-charity
mechanism M that, for a certain subclass P of (quasilinear)
preferences, under a given solution concept S 
(implementation in dominant strategies or Bayes-Nash equilibrium) and
a given notion of individual rationality R (ex post, ex 
interim, or none), satisfies a certain notion of budget balance
(ex post, ex ante, or none), and is ex-post efficient. Then
there exists such a mechanism for any number of charities.
Two mechanisms that satisfy efficiency (and can in fact be
applied directly to the multiple-charity problem without use
of the previous theorem) are the VCG (which is incentive
compatible in dominant strategies) and dAGVA (which is
incentive compatible only in Bayes-Nash equilibrium) 
mechanisms. Each of them, however, has a drawback that would
probably make it impractical in the setting of donations to
charities. The VCG mechanism is not budget balanced. The
dAGVA mechanism does not satisfy ex-post individual 
rationality. In the next subsection, we will investigate if we
can do better in the setting of donations to charities.
10.3 Impossibility of efficiency
In this subsection, we show that even in a very restricted
setting, and with minimal requirements on IC and IR 
constraints, it is impossible to create a mechanism that is 
efficient.
Theorem 8. There is no mechanism which is ex-post 
budget balanced, ex-post efficient, and ex-interim individually
rational with Bayes-Nash equilibrium as the solution concept
(even with only one charity, only two quasilinear bidders,
with identical type distributions (uniform over two types,
with either both utility functions being step functions or both
utility functions being concave piecewise linear functions)).
The case of step-functions in this theorem corresponds 
exactly to the case of a single, fixed-size, nonexcludable public
good (the public good being that the charity receives the
desired amount)-for which such an impossibility result is
already known [14]. Many similar results are known, 
probably the most famous of which is the Myerson-Satterthwaite
impossibility result, which proves the impossibility of 
efficient bilateral trade under the same requirements [15].
Theorem 7 indicates that there is no reason to decide on
donations to multiple charities under a single mechanism
(rather than a separate one for each charity), when an 
efficient mechanism with the desired properties exists for the
single-charity case. However, because under the 
requirements of Theorem 8, no such mechanism exists, there may
be a benefit to bringing the charities under the same 
umbrella. The next proposition shows that this is indeed the
case.
Proposition 2. There exist settings with two charities
where there exists no ex-post budget balanced, ex-post 
efficient, and ex-interim individually rational mechanism with
Bayes-Nash equilibrium as the solution concept for either
charity alone; but there exists an ex-post budget balanced,
ex-post efficient, and ex-post individually rational 
mechanism with dominant strategies as the solution concept for
both charities together. (Even when the conditions are the
same as in Theorem 8, apart from the fact that there are
now two charities.)
