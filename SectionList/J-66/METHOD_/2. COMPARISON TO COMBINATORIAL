AUCTIONS AND EXCHANGES
This section discusses the relationship between expressive
charity donation and combinatorial auctions and exchanges.
It can be skipped, but may be of interest to the reader with
a background in combinatorial auctions and exchanges.
In a combinatorial auction, there are m items for sale,
and bidders can place bids on bundles of one or more items.
The auctioneer subsequently labels each bid as winning or
losing, under the constraint that no item can be in more
than one winning bid, to maximize the sum of the values of
the winning bids. (This is known as the clearing problem.)
Variants include combinatorial reverse auctions, where the
auctioneer is seeking to procure a set of items; and 
combinatorial exchanges, where bidders can both buy and and sell
items (even within the same bid). Other extensions include
allowing for side constraints, as well as the specification of
attributes of the items in bids. Combinatorial auctions and
exchanges have recently become a popular research topic [20,
21, 17, 22, 9, 18, 13, 3, 12, 26, 19, 25, 2].
The problems of clearing expressive charity donation 
markets and clearing combinatorial auctions or exchanges are
very different in formulation. Nevertheless, there are 
interesting parallels. One of the main reasons for the interest
in combinatorial auctions and exchanges is that it allows
for expressive bidding. A bidder can express exactly how
much each different allocation is worth to her, and thus the
globally optimal allocation may be chosen by the 
auctioneer. Compare this to a bidder having to bid on two different
items in two different (one-item) auctions, without any way
of expressing that (for instance) one item is worthless if the
other item is not won. In this scenario, the bidder may win
the first item but not the second (because there was another
high bid on the second item that she did not anticipate),
leading to economic inefficiency.
Expressive bidding is also one of the main benefits of the
expressive charity donation market. Here, bidders can 
express exactly how much they are willing to donate for every
vector of amounts donated to charities. This may allow
bidders to negotiate a complex arrangement of who gives
how much to which charity, which is beneficial to all 
parties involved; whereas no such arrangement may have been
possible if the bidders had been restricted to using simple
matching offers on individual charities. Again, expressive
bidding is necessary to achieve economic efficiency.
Another parallel is the computational complexity of the
clearing problem. In order to achieve the full economic 
efficiency allowed by the market"s expressiveness (or even come
close to it), hard computational problems must be solved
in combinatorial auctions and exchanges, as well as in the
charity donation market (as we will see).
