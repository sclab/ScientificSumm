We introduced a bidding language for expressing very 
general types of matching offers over multiple charities. We 
formulated the corresponding clearing problem (deciding how
much each bidder pays, and how much each charity receives),
and showed that it is NP-complete to approximate to any 
ratio even in very restricted settings. We gave a mixed-integer
program formulation of the clearing problem, and showed
that for concave bids (where utility functions and payment
willingness function are concave), the program reduces to a
linear program and can hence be solved in polynomial time.
We then showed that the clearing problem for a subclass of
concave bids is at least as hard as the decision variant of 
linear programming, suggesting that we cannot do much better
than a linear programming implementation for such bids.
Subsequently, we showed that the clearing problem is much
easier when bids are quasilinear (where payment willingness
functions are linear)-for surplus, the problem decomposes
across charities, and for payment maximization, a greedy
approach is optimal if the bids are concave (although this
latter problem is weakly NP-complete when the bids are not
concave). For the quasilinear setting, we studied the 
mechanism design question of making the bidders report their
preferences truthfully rather than strategically. We showed
that an ex-post efficient mechanism is impossible even with
only one charity and a very restricted class of bids. We
also showed that even though the clearing problem 
decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be
benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design
standpoint.
There are many directions for future research. One is to
build a web-based implementation of the (first-price) 
mechanism proposed in this paper. Another is to study the 
computational scalability of our MIP/LP approach. It is also
59
important to identify other classes of bids (besides concave
ones) for which the clearing problem is tractable. Much
crucial work remains to be done on the mechanism design
problem. Finally, are there good iterative mechanisms for
charity donation?6
