When money is donated to a charitable (or other) cause
(hereafter referred to as charity), often the donating party
gives unconditionally: a fixed amount is transferred from
the donator to the charity, and none of this transfer is 
contingent on other events-in particular, it is not contingent
on the amount given by other parties. Indeed, this is 
currently often the only way to make a donation, especially for
small donating parties such as private individuals. However,
when multiple parties support the same charity, each of them
would prefer to see the others give more rather than less to
this charity. In such scenarios, it is sensible for a party to
use its contemplated donation as negotiating material to 
induce the others to give more. This is done by making the
donation conditional on the others" donations. The 
following example will illustrate this, and show that the donating
parties as well as the charitable cause may simultaneously
benefit from the potential for such negotiation.
Suppose we have two parties, 1 and 2, who are both 
supporters of charity A. To either of them, it would be worth
$0.75 if A received $1. It follows neither of them will be 
willing to give unconditionally, because $0.75 < $1. However, if
the two parties draw up a contract that says that they will
each give $0.5, both the parties have an incentive to accept
this contract (rather than have no contract at all): with the
contract, the charity will receive $1 (rather than $0 
without a contract), which is worth $0.75 to each party, which
is greater than the $0.5 that that party will have to give.
Effectively, each party has made its donation conditional on
the other party"s donation, leading to larger donations and
greater happiness to all parties involved.

One method that is often used to effect this is to make
a matching offer. Examples of matching offers are: I will
give x dollars for every dollar donated., or I will give x
dollars if the total collected from other parties exceeds y.
In our example above, one of the parties can make the offer
I will donate $0.5 if the other party also donates at least
that much, and the other party will have an incentive to
indeed donate $0.5, so that the total amount given to the
charity increases by $1. Thus this matching offer implements
the contract suggested above. As a real-world example, the
United States government has authorized a donation of up to
$1 billion to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria,
under the condition that the American contribution does not
exceed one third of the total-to encourage other countries
to give more [23].
However, there are several severe limitations to the simple
approach of matching offers as just described.
1. It is not clear how two parties can make matching 
offers where each party"s offer is stated in terms of the
amount that the other pays. (For example, it is not
clear what the outcome should be when both parties
offer to match the other"s donation.) Thus, matching
offers can only be based on payments made by 
parties that are giving unconditionally (not in terms of a
matching offer)-or at least there can be no circular
dependencies.1
2. Given the current infrastructure for making matching
offers, it is impractical to make a matching offer 
depend on the amounts given to multiple charities. For
instance, a party may wish to specify that it will pay
$100 given that charity A receives a total of $1000,
but that it will also count donations made to charity
B, at half the rate. (Thus, a total payment of $500 to
charity A combined with a total payment of $1000 to
charity B would be just enough for the party"s offer to
take effect.)
In contrast, in this paper we propose a new approach
where each party can express its relative preferences for 
different charities, and make its offer conditional on its own
appreciation for the vector of donations made to the 
different charities. Moreover, the amount the party offers to
donate at different levels of appreciation is allowed to vary
arbitrarily (it does need to be a dollar-for-dollar (or 
n-dollarfor-dollar) matching arrangement, or an arrangement where
the party offers a fixed amount provided a given (strike)
total has been exceeded). Finally, there is a clear 
interpretation of what it means when multiple parties are making
conditional offers that are stated in terms of each other.
Given each combination of (conditional) offers, there is a
(usually) unique solution which determines how much each
party pays, and how much each charity is paid.
However, as we will show, finding this solution (the 
clearing problem) requires solving a potentially difficult 
optimization problem. A large part of this paper is devoted to 
studying how difficult this problem is under different assumptions
on the structure of the offers, and providing algorithms for
solving it.

Typically, larger organizations match offers of private 
individuals. For example, the American Red Cross Liberty 
Disaster Fund maintains a list of businesses that match their
customers" donations [8].
Towards the end of the paper, we also study the 
mechanism design problem of motivating the bidders to bid 
truthfully.
In short, expressive negotiation over donations to charities
is a new way in which electronic commerce can help the
world. A web-based implementation of the ideas described
in this paper can facilitate voluntary reallocation of wealth
on a global scale. Aditionally, optimally solving the clearing
problem (and thereby generating the maximum economic
welfare) requires the application of sophisticated algorithms.
