We have solved the open question of determining the
complexity of computing a structured item graph 
associated with a combinatorial auction scenario. The result is
bad news, since it turned out that it is NP-complete to
check whether a combinatorial auction has a structured item
graph, even for treewidth 3. Motivated by this result, we 
investigated the use of hypertree decomposition (on the dual
hypergraph associated with the scenario) and we shown that
the problem is tractable on the class of those instances whose
dual hypergraphs have bounded hypertree width. For some
special, yet relevant cases, a highly parallelizable algorithm
is also discussed. Interestingly, it also emerged that the class
of structured item graphs is properly contained in the class
of instances having bounded hypertree width (hence, the
reason of their intractability is not their generality).
In particular, the latter result is established by showing
a precise relationship between structured item graphs and
restricted forms of hypertree decompositions (on the dual
hypergraph), called query decompositions (see, e.g., [7]). In
the light of this observation, we note that proving some 
approximability results for structured item graphs requires a
deep understanding of the approximability of query 
decompositions, which is currently missing in the literature.
As a further avenue of research, it would be relevant to
enhance the algorithm ComputeSetPackingk, e.g., by using
specialized data structures, in order to avoid the quadratic
dependency from (|E(H)| + 1)k
.
Finally, an other interesting question is to assess whether
the structural decomposition techniques discussed in the 
paper can be used to efficiently deal with generalizations of the
winner determination problem. For instance, it might be 
relevant in several application scenarios to design algorithms
that can find a selling strategy when several copies of the
same item are available for selling, and when moreover the
auctioneer is satisfied when at least a given number of copies
is actually sold.
