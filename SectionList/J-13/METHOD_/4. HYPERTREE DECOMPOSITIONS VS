STRUCTURED ITEM GRAPHS
Given that the class C(hw, k) has been shown to be an
island of tractability for the winner determination problem,
and given that the class C(ig, k) has been shown not to be
efficiently recognizable, one may be inclined to think that
there are instances having unbounded hypertree width, but
admitting an item graph of bounded tree width (so that the
intractability of structured item graphs would lie in their
generality).
Surprisingly, we establish this is not the case. The line of
the proof is to first show that structured item graphs are in
one-to-one correspondence with a special kind of hypertree
decompositions of the dual hypergraph, which we shall call
strict. Then, the result will follow by proving that k-width
strict hypertree decompositions are less powerful than 
kwith hypertree decompositions.
4.1 Strict Hypertree Decompositions
Let H be a hypergraph, and let V ⊆ N(H) be a set of
nodes and X, Y ∈ N(H). X is [V ]-adjacent to Y if there
exists an edge h ∈ E(H) such that {X, Y } ⊆ (h − V ). A
[V ]-path π from X to Y is a sequence X = X0, . . . , X = Y
of variables such that: Xi is [V ]-adjacent to Xi+1, for each
i ∈ [0... -1]. A set W ⊆ N(H) of nodes is [V ]-connected
if ∀X, Y ∈ W there is a [V ]-path from X to Y . A
[V ]-component is a maximal [V ]-connected non-empty set
of nodes W ⊆ (N(H) − V ). For any [V ]-component C, let
E(C) = {h ∈ E(H) | h ∩ C = ∅}.
Definition 2. A hypertree decomposition HD =
T, χ, λ of H is strict if the following conditions hold:
1. for each pair of vertices r and s in vertices(T)
such that s is a child of r, and for each
[χ(r)]-component Cr s.t. Cr ∩ χ(Ts) = ∅, Cr is a
[χ(r) ∩ N(λ(r) ∩ λ(s))]-component;
2. for each edge h ∈ E(H), there is a vertex p such that
h ∈ λ(p) and h ⊆ χ(p) (we say p strongly covers h);
3. for each edge h ∈ E(H), the set {p ∈ vertices(T) | h ∈
λ(p)} induces a (connected) subtree of T.
The strict hypertree width shw(H) of H is the minimum
width over all its strict hypertree decompositions. P
The basic relationship between nice hypertree 
decompositions and structured item graphs is shown in the following
theorem.
Theorem 6. Let H be a hypergraph such that for each
node v ∈ N(H), {v} is in E(H). Then, a k-width tree 
decomposition of an item graph for H exists if and only if ¯H
has a (k + 1)-width strict hypertree decomposition2
.
Note that, as far as the maximum weighted-set packing
problem is concerned, given a hypergraph H, we can always
assume that for each node v ∈ N(H), {v} is in E(H). In
fact, if this hyperedge is not in the hypergraph, then it can
be added without loss of generality, by setting w({v}) = 0.
Therefore, letting C(shw, k) denote the class of all the 
hypergraphs whose dual hypergraphs (associated with maximum

of the different definition of width for tree decompositions
and hypertree decompositions.

weighted-set packing problems) have strict hypertree width
bounded by k, we have that C(shw, k + 1) = C(ig, k).
By definition, strict hypertree decompositions are special
hypertree decompositions. In fact, we are able to show that
the additional conditions in Definition 2 induce an actual
restriction on the decomposition power.
Theorem 7. C(ig, k) = C(shw, k + 1) ⊂ C(hw, k + 1).
A Game Theoretic View. We shed further lights on
strict hypertree decompositions by discussing an interesting
characterization based on the strict Robber and Marshals
Game, defined by adapting the Robber and Marshals game
defined in [6], which characterizes hypertree width.
The game is played on a hypergraph H by a robber against
k marshals which act in coordination. Marshals move on
the hyperedges of H, while the robber moves on nodes of
H. The robber sees where the marshals intend to move, and
reacts by moving to another node which is connected with
its current position and through a path in G(H) which does
not use any node contained in a hyperedge that is occupied
by the marshals before and after their move-we say that
these hyperedges are blocked. Note that in the basic game
defined in [6], the robber is not allowed to move on vertices
that are occupied by the marshals before and after their
move, even if they do not belong to blocked hyperedges.
Importantly, marshals are required to play monotonically,
i.e., they cannot occupy an edge that was previously 
occupied in the game, and which is currently not. The marshals
win the game if they capture the robber, by occupying an
edge covering a node where the robber is. Otherwise, the
robber wins.
Theorem 8. Let H be a hypergraph such that for each
node v ∈ N(H), {v} is in E(H). Then, ¯H has a k-width
strict hypertree decomposition if and only if k marshals can
win the strict Robber and Marshals Game on ¯H, no matter
of the robber"s moves.
