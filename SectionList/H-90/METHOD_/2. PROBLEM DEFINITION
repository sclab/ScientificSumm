There are two kinds of context information we can use for 
implicit feedback. One is short-term context, which is the immediate
surrounding information which throws light on a user"s current 
information need in a single session. A session can be considered as a
period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.
The category of a user"s information need (e.g., kids or sports), 
previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of
short-term context. Such information is most directly related to the
current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be
most useful for improving the current search. In general, short-term
context is most useful for improving search in the current session,
but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different 
session. The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers
to information such as a user"s education level and general interest,
accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough 
information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is
often accumulated over time. Long-term context can be applicable
to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context
in improving search accuracy for a particular session. In this paper,
we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods
can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.
In a single search session, a user may interact with the search
system several times. During interactions, the user would 
continuously modify the query. Therefore for the current query Qk 
(except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history,
HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the 
preceding queries given by the same user in the current session. Note
that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.
In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session
boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16]. Traditionally, the
retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval. But
the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about
the user"s current information need as seen in the java example
given in the previous section. Indeed, our previous work [15] has
shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving 
retrieval accuracy.
In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term
context information available. For example, a user would 
presumably frequently click some documents to view. We refer to data
associated with these actions as clickthrough history. The 
clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the
content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document. 
Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually 
relevant to the user"s information need, we may safely assume that
the displayed summary/title information about the document is 
attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the user"s 
information need. Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text 
information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we
will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval. In
general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.
We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1)
to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk. Previous
work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough 
information [11, 17].
Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit 
feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information
retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them. In
this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ),
develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough
history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate
these models.
