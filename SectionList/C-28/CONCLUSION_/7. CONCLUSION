In this article, we proposed and evaluated PackageBLAST,
an adaptive multi-policy grid service to execute master/slave
BLAST searches. PackageBLAST contains a framework
where the user can choose or incorporate allocation policies.
We also defined a strategy, PSS, that adapts the chosen 
policy to a heterogeneous non-dedicated grid environment.
The results collected by running PackageBLAST with 5
allocation policies in a grid testbed were very good. In 
order to compare a 10KBP real DNA sequence against the
nr genetic database, we were able to reduce execution time
from 30.88 min to 2.11 min. Also, we showed that, in our
testbed, there is no allocation policy that always achieves
the best performance and that makes evident the 
importance of providing multiple policies. Moreover, we showed
that the introduction of PSS led to very good performance
gains for some policies.
As future work, we intend to run PackageBLAST in a 
geographically dispersed grid, to evaluate the impact of high
network latencies in the allocation policies and in PSS. Also,
we intend to provide support for genomic database 
synchronization and dynamic join/leave operations for slaves.
