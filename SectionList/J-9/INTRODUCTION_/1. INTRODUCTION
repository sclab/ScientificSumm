The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states
that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all 
information available to all traders. As a result, market prices 
encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all 
information, even if that information is distributed across many
sources. Supporting evidence can be found in empirical
studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8,
22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets
[30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of
experimental markets [6, 25, 26].
The process of information incorporation is, at its essence,
a distributed computation. Each trader begins with his or
her own information. As trades are made, summary 
information is revealed through market prices. Traders learn or
infer what information others are likely to have by observing
prices, then update their own beliefs based on their 
observations. Over time, if the process works as advertised, all
information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same
information state. At this point, the market is in what is
called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19]. All
information available to all traders is now reflected in the
going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some
new information becomes available.
While most markets are not designed with information 
aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives
156
markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports
betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets
have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating 
information on a topic of interest. The Iowa Electronic 
Market1
is a prime example, operated by the University of Iowa
Tippie College of Business for the purpose of investigating
how information about political elections distributed among
traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are
tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8].
In this paper, we investigate the nature of the 
computational process whereby distributed information is revealed
and combined over time into the prices in information 
markets. To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an 
information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and,
we believe, captures much of the important essence of real
information markets. In Section 4, we present our main 
theoretical results concerning this model. We prove that only
Boolean securities whose payoffs can be expressed as 
threshold functions of the distributed input bits of information are
guaranteed to converge as predicted by rational expectations
theory. Boolean securities with more complex payoffs may
not converge under some prior distributions. We also 
provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence time for
these threshold securities. We show that, for all prior 
distributions, the price of a threshold security converges to its
rational expectations equilibrium price in at most n rounds,
where n is the number of bits of distributed information. We
show that this worst-case bound is tight within a factor of
two by illustrating a situation in which a threshold security
requires n/2 rounds to converge.
