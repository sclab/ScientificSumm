MARKET
To investigate the properties and limitations of the 
process whereby an information market converges toward its
rational-expectations equilibrium, we formulate a 
representative model of the market. In designing the model, our
goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to
be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to
admit meaningful analysis. Any modeling decisions must
trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the 
decision process is as much an art as a science. Nonetheless,
we believe that our model captures enough of the essence
of real information markets to lend credence to the results
that follow. In this section, we present our modeling 
assumptions and justifications in detail. Section 3.1 describes
the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers
the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents"
strategies.
3.1 Initial information state
There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom
is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi. The 
vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn). In the
initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of 
information. All agents have a common prior regarding the
joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any
specific information about the actual value of bits held by
others. Note that this common-prior assumption-typical
in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents
agree. To the contrary, because each agent has different
information, the initial state of the system is in general a
state of disagreement. Nearly any disagreement that could
be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be 
mod157
eled by assuming a common prior with different information,
and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it
may seem.
3.2 Market mechanism
The security being traded by the agents is a financial 
instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents" bits.
The form of f (the description of the security) is common
knowledge3
among agents. We sometimes refer to the xi as
the input bits. At some time in the future after trading is
completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4
and every
owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per
unit owned. If an agent ends with a negative quantity of
the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the
amount f(x) in cash per unit. Note that if someone were
to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that
person would know the true value f(x) of the security with
certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price
lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than
f(x).5
Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and 
Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation
process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].
The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The 
market proceeds in synchronous rounds. In each round, each
agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi. The semantics
are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and
an amount bi of money to be traded in the market. For 
simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit
or short sales, and so an agent"s trade is not constrained
by her possessions. The market clears in each round by
settling at a single price that balances the trade in that
round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi. At the end
of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the
money she bid: qi = bi/p. In addition, she is left with an
amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p:
bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi. Note that agent i"s net trade in
the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.
After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.
Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information
garnered from the new price. The next round proceeds as
the previous. The process continues until an equilibrium is
reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from
one round to the next.
In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction
on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for
each agent i. This modeling assumption serves two 
analytical purposes. First, it ensures that there is forced trade in
every round. Classic results in economics show that 
perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with
each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have
differing information) [20]. There are many factors that can
induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of
risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading
for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a 
market maker who is pumping money into the market through a
subsidy. We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the

that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad
infinitum [5].

informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons). 
Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume
of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing
price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple
function of the agents" bids, p = i bi/n. We will discuss
the implications of alternative market models in Section 5.
3.3 Agent strategies
In order to draw formal conclusions about the price 
evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how
agents behave. Essentially we assume that agents are 
riskneutral, myopic,6
and bid truthfully: Each agent in each
round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which
is that agent"s estimation of the expected payoff of the 
security. Expectations are computed according to each agent"s
probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes" rule
when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) 
becomes available. We also assume that it is common 
knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.
Would rational agents actually behave according to this
strategy? It"s hard to say. Certainly, we do not claim that
this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.
Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some 
legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to
effect other agents" judgments in the following rounds 
(nonmyopic reasoning). However, we believe that the strategy
outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis. Solving
for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting
seems extremely difficult. Our assumptions seem 
reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that
extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve
upon simply bidding one"s true expected value. In this case,
according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the 
clearing price is below an agent"s expected value that agent will
end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the
clearing price is above the agent"s expected value, the agent
will end up selling (also increasing expected profit).
