One key obstacle to using voting for preference 
aggregation is the communication burden that an election places
on the voters. By lowering this burden, it may become 
feasible to conduct more elections over more issues. In the
limit, this could lead to a shift from representational 
government to a system in which most issues are decided by
referenda-a veritable e-democracy. In this paper, we 
analyzed the communication complexity of the common voting
rules. Knowing which voting rules require little 
communication is especially important when the issue to be voted
on is of low enough importance that the following is true:
the parties involved are willing to accept a rule that tends
86
to produce outcomes that are slightly less representative of
the voters" preferences, if this rule reduces the 
communication burden on the voters significantly. The following table
summarizes the results we obtained.
Rule Lower bound Upper bound
plurality Ω(n log m) O(n log m)
plurality w/ runoff Ω(n log m) O(n log m)
STV Ω(n log m) O(n(log m)2)
Condorcet Ω(nm) O(nm)
approval Ω(nm) O(nm)
Bucklin Ω(nm) O(nm)
cup Ω(nm) O(nm)
maximin Ω(nm) O(nm)
Borda Ω(nm log m) O(nm log m)
Copeland Ω(nm log m) O(nm log m)
ranked pairs Ω(nm log m) O(nm log m)
Communication complexity of voting rules, sorted from low
to high. All of the upper bounds are deterministic (with
the exception of maximin, for which the best deterministic
upper bound we proved is O(nm log m)). All of the lower
bounds hold even for nondeterministic communication and
even just for determining whether a given candidate a is
the winner.
One area of future research is to study what happens when
we restrict our attention to communication protocols that
do not reveal any strategically useful information. This 
restriction may invalidate some of the upper bounds that we
derived using multistage communication protocols. Also, all
of our bounds are worst-case bounds. It may be possible to
outperform these bounds when the distribution of votes has
additional structure.
When deciding which voting rule to use for an election,
there are many considerations to take into account. The
voting rules that we studied in this paper are the most 
common ones that have survived the test of time. One way to
select among these rules is to consider recent results on 
complexity. The table above shows that from a communication
complexity perspective, plurality, plurality with runoff, and
STV are preferable. However, plurality has the undesirable
property that it is computationally easy to manipulate by
voting strategically [3, 7]. Plurality with runoff is NP-hard
to manipulate by a coalition of weighted voters, or by an
individual that faces correlated uncertainty about the 
others" votes [7, 6]. STV is NP-hard to manipulate in those
settings as well [7], but also by an individual with perfect
knowledge of the others" votes (when the number of 
candidates is unbounded) [2]. Therefore, STV is more robust,
although it may require slightly more worst-case 
communication as per the table above. Yet other selection criteria
are the computational complexity of determining whether
enough information has been elicited to declare a winner,
and that of determining the optimal sequence of queries [8].
