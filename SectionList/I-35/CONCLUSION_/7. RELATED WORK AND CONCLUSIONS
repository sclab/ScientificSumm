Our contributions in this paper are three-fold. Firstly, we
introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning
about norms in a distributed manner.
To our knowledge, there is little work published in this
direction. In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the
distributed enforcement of norms in MAS. However, in both
works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards
legal messages according to a set of norms. Since these 
interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed
in terms of actions of that agent. This is a serious 
disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one
agent due to a certain message of another one.
The second contribution is the proposal of a normative
structure. The notion is fruitful because it allows the 
separation of normative and procedural concerns. The normative
structure we propose makes evident the similarity between
the propagation of normative positions and the propagation

of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets. That similarity readily
suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to
a convenient analytical treatment of the normative 
structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection,
in particular. The idea of modelling interactions (in the
form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated
in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents
are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently 
combined for analysis. In [5], conversations are first designed
and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated
into protocols. Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to
CPNs. To our knowledge, the use of this representation in
the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not
been reported elsewhere.
Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve
normative conflicts. Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts
from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to
order the norms involved. His idea is implemented in [12]
but requires a central resource for norm maintenance. The
approach to conflict detection and resolution is an 
adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs 
reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27]. The algorithm
presented in the current paper can be used to manage 
normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen
in parallel have an associated normative state Î” to which the
algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is
to be introduced.
These three contributions we present in this paper open
many possibilities for future work. We should mention first,
that as a broad strategy we are working on a 
generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate
with different coordination models, with richer deontic 
content and on top of different computational realisations of
regulated MAS. As a first step in this direction we are 
taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction 
protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative
structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for
electronic institutions (as defined in [1]). We expect such
coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more 
flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.
Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several
directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part
of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time;
(2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities
based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3]
and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2];
(3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different
semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting 
different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus
obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).
On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis 
techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs
(e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of
Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable 
offline conflict detection. The combination of these techniques
along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is 
intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to 
incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way.
