We use a supply-chain scenario in which companies and
individuals come together at an online marketplace to 
conduct business. The overall transaction procedure may be
organised as six distributed activities, represented as nodes
in the diagram in Figure 1. They involve different 
participants whose behaviour is coordinated through protocols.
In this scenario agents can play one of four roles: 
marExit
Registration
Payment
Delivery
Negotiation
Coordination Model
Contract
Figure 1: Activity Structure of the Scenario
ketplace accountant (acc), client, supplier (supp) and 
warehouse managers (wm). The arrows connecting the activities
represent how agents can move from one activity to another.
After registering at the marketplace, clients and suppliers
get together in an activity where they negotiate the terms of
their transaction, i.e. prices, amounts of goods to be 
delivered, deadlines and other details. In the contract activity,
the order becomes established and an invoice is prepared.
The client will then participate in a payment activity, 
verifying his credit-worthiness and instructing his bank to transfer
the correct amount of money. The supplier in the meantime
will arrange for the goods to be delivered (e.g. via a 
warehouse manager) in the delivery activity. Finally, agents can
leave the marketplace conforming to a predetermined exit
protocol. The marketplace accountant participates in most
of the activities as a trusted provider of auditing tools.
In the rest of the paper we shall build on this scenario
to exemplify the notion of normative structure and to 
illustrate our approach to conflict detection and resolution in a
distributed setting.
