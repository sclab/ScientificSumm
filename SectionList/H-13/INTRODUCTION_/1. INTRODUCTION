The major commercial Web search engines all present
their results in much the same way. Each search result is
described by a brief caption, comprising the URL of the 
associated Web page, a title, and a brief summary (or 
snippet) describing the contents of the page. Often the snippet
is extracted from the Web page itself, but it may also be
taken from external sources, such as the human-generated
summaries found in Web directories.
Figure 1 shows a typical Web search, with captions for the
top three results. While the three captions share the same
basic structure, their content differs in several respects. The
snippet of the third caption is nearly twice as long as that
of the first, while the snippet is missing entirely from the
second caption. The title of the third caption contains all
of the query terms in order, while the titles of the first and
second captions contain only two of the three terms. One of
the query terms is repeated in the first caption. All of the
query terms appear in the URL of the third caption, while
none appear in the URL of the first caption. The snippet
of the first caption consists of a complete sentence that 
concisely describes the associated page, while the snippet of the
third caption consists of two incomplete sentences that are
largely unrelated to the overall contents of the associated
page and to the apparent intent of the query.
While these differences may seem minor, they may also
have a substantial impact on user behavior. A principal
motivation for providing a caption is to assist the user in
determining the relevance of the associated page without
actually having to click through to the result. In the case of
a navigational query - particularly when the destination is
well known - the URL alone may be sufficient to identify
the desired page. But in the case of an informational query,
the title and snippet may be necessary to guide the user in
selecting a page for further study, and she may judge the
relevance of a page on the basis of the caption alone.
When this judgment is correct, it can speed the search
process by allowing the user to avoid unwanted material.
When it fails, the user may waste her time clicking through
to an inappropriate result and scanning a page containing
little or nothing of interest. Even worse, the user may be
misled into skipping a page that contains desired 
information.
All three of the results in figure 1 are relevant, with some
limitations. The first result links to the main Yahoo Kids!
homepage, but it is then necessary to follow a link in a menu
to find the main page for games. Despite appearances, the
second result links to a surprisingly large collection of 
online games, primarily with environmental themes. The third
result might be somewhat disappointing to a user, since it
leads to only a single game, hosted at the Centers for Disease
Control, that could not reasonably be described as online.
Unfortunately, these page characteristics are not entirely 
reflected in the captions.
In this paper, we examine the influence of caption 
features on user"s Web search behavior, using clickthroughs
extracted from search engines logs as our primary 
investigative tool. Understanding this influence may help to validate
algorithms and guidelines for the improved generation of the

captions themselves. In addition, these features can play a
role in the process of inferring relevance judgments from user
behavior [1]. By better understanding their influence, better
judgments may result.
Different caption generation algorithms might select 
snippets of different lengths from different areas of a page. 
Snippets may be generated in a query-independent fashion, 
providing a summary of the page as a whole, or in a 
querydependent fashion, providing a summary of how the page
relates to the query terms. The correct choice of snippet
may depend on aspects of both the query and the result
page. The title may be taken from the HTML header or
extracted from the body of the document [8]. For links that
re-direct, it may be possible to display alternative URLs.
Moreover, for pages listed in human-edited Web directories
such as the Open Directory Project1
, it may be possible
to display alternative titles and snippets derived from these
listings.
When these alternative snippets, titles and URLs are 
available, the selection of an appropriate combination for display
may be guided by their features. A snippet from a Web 
directory may consist of complete sentences and be less 
fragmentary than an extracted snippet. A title extracted from
the body may provide greater coverage of the query terms.
A URL before re-direction may be shorter and provide a
clearer idea of the final destination.
The work reported in this paper was undertaken in the
context of the Windows Live search engine. The image in 
figure 1 was captured from Windows Live and cropped to 
eliminate branding, advertising and navigational elements. The
experiments reported in later sections are based on 
Windows Live query logs, result pages and relevance judgments
collected as part of ongoing research into search engine 
performance [1,2]. Nonetheless, given the similarity of caption
formats across the major Web search engines we believe the
results are applicable to these other engines. The query in

figure 1 produces results with similar relevance on the other
major search engines. This and other queries produce 
captions that exhibit similar variations. In addition, we believe
our methodology may be generalized to other search 
applications when sufficient clickthrough data is available.
