For understanding the ideas behind the analysis of the general
model, it is very useful to first consider a special case with a

Kranton and Minehart, however, can also analyze a more 
general setting in which buyers values are private and thus buyers and
sellers play a game of incomplete information. We deal only with
complete information.

stricted form of traders that we refer to as pair-traders. In this case,
each trader is connected to just one buyer and one seller. (Thus, it
essentially serves as a trade route between the two.) The 
techniques we develop to handle this case will form a useful basis for
reasoning about the case of traders that may be connected 
arbitrarily to the sellers and buyers.
We will relate profits in a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium to
optimal solutions of a certain linear program, use this relation to
show that all equilibria result in efficient allocation of the goods,
and show that a pure equilibrium always exists. First, we consider
the simplest model where sellers have indistinguishable items, and
each buyer is interested in getting one item. Then we extend the
results to the more general case of a matching market, as discussed
in the previous section, where valuations depend on the identity
of the seller and buyer. We then characterize the minimum and
maximum profits traders can make. In the next section, we extend
the results to traders that may be connected to any subset of sellers
and buyers.
Given that we are working with pair-traders in this section, we
can represent the problem using a bipartite graph G whose node set
is B ∪ S, and where each trader t, connecting seller i and buyer j,
appears as an edge t = (i, j) in G. Note, however, that we allow
multiple traders to connect the same pair of agents. For each buyer
and seller i, we will use adj(i) to denote the set of traders who can
trade with i.
2.1 Indistinguishable Goods
The socially optimal trade for the case of indistinguishable goods
is the solution of the transportation problem: sending goods along
the edges representing the traders. The edges along which trade
occurs correspond to a matching in this bipartite graph, and the
optimal trade is described by the following linear program.
max SV (x) =
X
t∈T :t=(i,j)
xt(θj − θi)
xt ≥ 0 ∀t ∈ T
X
t∈adj(i)
xt ≤ 1 ∀i ∈ S
X
t∈adj(j)
xt ≤ 1 ∀j ∈ B
Next we consider an equilibrium. Each trader t = (i, j) must
offer a bid βt and an ask αt. (We omit the subscript denoting the
seller and buyer here since we are dealing with pair-traders.) Given
the bid and ask price, the agents react to these prices, as described
earlier. Instead of focusing on prices, we will focus on profits. If
a seller i sells to a trader t ∈ adj(i) with bid βt then his profit is
pi = βt − θi. Similarly, if a buyer j buys from a trader t ∈ adj(j)
with ask αt, then his profit is pj = θj − αt. Finally, if a trader t
trades with ask αt and bid βt then his profit is yt = αt − βt. All
agents not involved in trade make 0 profit. We will show that the
profits at equilibrium are an optimal solution to the following linear
program.
min sum(p, y) =
X
i∈B∪S
pi +
X
t∈T
yt
yt ≥ 0 ∀t ∈ T :
pi ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ S ∪ B :
yt ≥ (θj − pj) − (θi + pi) ∀t = (i, j) ∈ T
LEMMA 2.1. At equilibrium the profits must satisfy the above
inequalities.
Proof. Clearly all profits are nonnegative, as trading is optional for
all agents.
To see why the last set of inequalities holds, consider two cases
separately. For a trader t who conducted trade, we get equality by
definition. For other traders t = (i, j), the value pi +θi is the price
that seller i sold for (or θi if seller i decided to keep the good).
Offering a bid βt > pi + θi would get the seller to sell to trader t.
Similarly, θj − pj is the price that buyer j bought for (or θj if he
didn"t buy), and for any ask αt < θj − pj, the buyer will buy from
trader t. So unless θj − pj ≤ θi + pi the trader has a profitable
deviation.
Now we are ready to prove our first theorem:
THEOREM 2.2. In any equilibrium the trade is efficient.
Proof. Let x be a flow of goods resulting in an equilibrium, and let
variables p and y be the profits.
Consider the linear program describing the socially optimal trade.
We will also add a set of additional constraints xt ≤ 1 for all traders
t ∈ T; this can be added to the description, as it is implied by the
other constraints. Now we claim that the two linear programs are
duals of each other. The variables pi for agents B ∪ S correspond
to the equations
P
t∈adj(i) xt ≤ 1. The additional dual variable yt
corresponds to an additional inequality xt ≤ 1.
The optimality of the social value of the trade will follow from
the claim that the solution of these two linear programs derived
from an equilibrium satisfy the complementary slackness 
conditions for this pair of linear programs, and hence both x and (p, y)
are optimal solutions to the corresponding linear programs.
There are three different complementary slackness conditions we
need to consider, corresponding to the three sets of variables x, y
and p. Any agent can only make profit if he transacts, so pi > 0
implies
P
t∈adj(i) xt = 1, and similarly, yt > 0 implies that xt =
1 also. Finally, consider a trader t with xt > 0 that trades between
seller i and buyer j, and recall that we have seen above that the
inequality yt ≥ (θj − pj) − (θi + pi) is satisfied with equality for
those who trade.
Next we argue that equilibria always exist.
THEOREM 2.3. For any efficient trade between buyers and 
sellers there is a pure equilibrium of bid-ask values that supports this
trade.
Proof. Consider an efficient trade; let xt = 1 if t trades and 0
otherwise; and consider an optimal solution (p, y) to the dual linear
program.
We would like to claim that all dual solutions correspond to 
equilibrium prices, but unfortunately this is not exactly true. Before we
can convert a dual solution to equilibrium prices, we may need to
modify the solution slightly as follows. Consider any agent i that
is only connected to a single trader t. Because the agent is only
connected to a single trader, the variables yt and pi are dual 
variables corresponding to the same primal inequality xt ≤ 1, and
they always appear together as yt + pi in all inequalities, and also
in the objective function. Thus there is an optimal solution in which
pi = 0 for all agents i connected only to a single trader.
Assume (p, y) is a dual solution where agents connected only
to one trader have pi = 0. For a seller i, let βt = θi + pi be
the bid for all traders t adjacent to i. Similarly, for each buyer j,
let αt = θj − pj be the ask for all traders t adjacent to j. We
claim that this set of bids and asks, together with the trade x, are an
equilibrium. To see why, note that all traders t adjacent to a seller
or buyer i offer the same ask or bid, and so trading with any trader
is equally good for agent i. Also, if i is not trading in the solution
147
x then by complementary slackness pi = 0, and hence not trading
is also equally good for i. This shows that sellers and buyers don"t
have an incentive to deviate.
We need to show that traders have no incentive to deviate either.
When a trader t is trading with seller i and buyer j, then profitable
deviations would involve increasing αt or decreasing βt. But by
our construction (and assumption about monopolized agents) all
sellers and buyers have multiple identical ask/bid offers, or trade
is occurring at valuation. In either case such a deviation cannot be
successful.
Finally, consider a trader t = (i, j) who doesn"t trade. A 
deviation for t would involve offering a lower ask to seller i and a
higher bid to seller j than their current trade. However, yt = 0 by
complementary slackness, and hence pi + θi ≥ θj − pj, so i sells
for a price at least as high as the price at which j buys, so trader t
cannot create profitable trade.
Note that a seller or buyer i connected to a single trader t cannot
have profit at equilibrium, so possible equilibrium profits are in
one-to-one correspondence with dual solutions for which pi = 0
whenever i is monopolized by one trader.
A disappointing feature of the equilibrium created by this proof
is that some agents t may have to create ask-bid pairs where βt >
αt, offering to buy for more than the price at which they are willing
to sell. Agents that make such crossing bid-ask pairs never actually
perform a trade, so it does not result in negative profit for the agent,
but such pairs are unnatural. Crossing bid-ask pairs are weakly
dominated by the strategy of offering a low bid β = 0 and an
extremely high ask to guarantee that neither is accepted.
To formulate a way of avoiding such crossing pairs, we say an
equilibrium is cross-free if αt ≥ βt for all traders t. We now show
there is always a cross-free equilibrium.
THEOREM 2.4. For any efficient trade between buyers and 
sellers there is a pure cross-free equilibrium.
Proof. Consider an optimal solution to the dual linear program.
To get an equilibrium without crossing bids, we need to do a more
general modification than just assuming that pi = 0 for all sellers
and buyers connected to only a single trader. Let the set E be the
set of edges t = (i, j) that are tight, in the sense that we have
the equality yt = (θj − pj) − (θi + pi). This set E contain all
the edges where trade occurs, and some more edges. We want to
make sure that pi = 0 for all sellers and buyers that have degree at
most 1 in E. Consider a seller i that has pi > 0. We must have i
involved in a trade, and the edge t = (i, j) along which the trade
occurs must be tight. Suppose this is the only tight edge adjacent
to agent i; then we can decrease pi and increase yt till one of the
following happens: either pi = 0 or the constraint of some other
agent t ∈ adj(i) becomes tight. This change only increases the set
of tight edges E, keeps the solution feasible, and does not change
the objective function value. So after doing this for all sellers, and
analogously changing yt and pj for all buyers, we get an optimal
solution where all sellers and buyers i either have pi = 0 or have
at least two adjacent tight edges.
Now we can set asks and bids to form a cross-free equilibrium.
For all traders t = (i, j) associated with an edge t ∈ E we set αt
and βt as before: we set the bid βt = pi + θi and the ask αt =
θj −pj. For a trader t = (i, j) ∈ E we have that pi +θi > θj −pj
and we set αt = βt to be any value in the range [θj − pj, pi + θi].
This guarantees that for each seller or buyer the best sell or buy
offer is along the edge where trade occurs in the solution. The 
askbid values along the tight edges guarantee that traders who trade
cannot increase their spread. Traders t = (i, j) who do not trade
cannot make profit due to the constraint pi + θi ≥ θj − pj

2.2 Distinguishable Goods
We now consider the case of distinguishable goods. As in the
previous section, we can write a transshipment linear program for
the socially optimal trade, with the only change being in the 
objective function.
max SV (x) =
X
t∈T :t=(i,j)
xt(θji − θij)
We can show that the dual of this linear program corresponds to
trader profits. Recall that we needed to add the constraints xt ≤ 1
for all traders. The dual is then:
min sum(p, y) =
X
i∈B∪S
pi +
X
t∈T
yt
yt ≥ 0 ∀t ∈ T :
pi ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ S ∪ B :
yt ≥ (θji − pj) − (θij + pi) ∀t = (i, j) ∈ T
It is not hard to extend the proofs of Theorems 2.2 - 2.4 to this case.
Profits in an equilibrium satisfy the dual constraints, and profits and
trade satisfy complementary slackness. This shows that trade is
socially optimal. Taking an optimal dual solution where pi = 0 for
all agents that are monopolized, we can convert it to an equilibrium,
and with a bit more care, we can also create an equilibrium with no
crossing bid-ask pairs.
THEOREM 2.5. All equilibria for the case of pair-traders with
distinguishable goods result in socially optimal trade. Pure 
noncrossing equilibria exist.
2.3 Trader Profits
We have seen that all equilibria are efficient. However, it turns
out that equilibria may differ in how the value of the allocation is
spread between the sellers, buyers and traders. Figure 2 depicts a
simple example of this phenomenon.
Our goal is to understand how a trader"s profit is affected by its
position in the network; we will use the characterization we 
obtained to work out the range of profits a trader can make. To 
maximize the profit of a trader t (or a subset of traders T ) all we need
to do is to find an optimal solution to the dual linear program 
maximizing the value of yt (or the sum
P
t∈T yt). Such dual solutions
will then correspond to equilibria with non-crossing prices.

THEOREM 2.6. For any trader t or subset of traders T the
maximum total profit they can make in any equilibrium can be 
computed in polynomial time. This maximum profit can be obtained by
a non-crossing equilibrium.
One way to think about the profit of a trader t = (i, j) is as a
subtraction from the value of the corresponding edge (i, j). The
value of the edge is the social value θji − θij if the trader makes
no profit, and decreases to θji − θij − yt if the trader t insists on
making yt profit. Trader t gets yt profit in equilibrium, if after this
decrease in the value of the edge, the edge is still included in the
optimal transshipment.
THEOREM 2.7. A trader t can make profit in an equilibrium if
and only if t is essential for the social welfare, that is, if deleting
agent t decreases social welfare. The maximum profit he can make
is exactly his value to society, that is, the increase his presence
causes in the social welfare.
If we allow crossing equilibria, then we can also find the 
minimum possible profit. Recall that in the proof of Theorem 2.3,
traders only made money off of sellers or buyers that they have
a monopoly over. Allowing such equilibria with crossing bids we
can find the minimum profit a trader or set of traders can make, by
minimizing the value yt (or sum
P
t∈T yt) over all optimal 
solutions that satisfy pi = 0 whenever i is connected to only a single
trader.
THEOREM 2.8. For any trader t or subset of traders T the
minimum total profit they can make in any equilibrium can be 
computed in polynomial time.
