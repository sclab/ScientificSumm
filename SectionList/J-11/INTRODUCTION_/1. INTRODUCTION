In a range of settings where markets mediate the interactions of
buyers and sellers, one observes several recurring properties: 
Individual buyers and sellers often trade through intermediaries, not all
buyers and sellers have access to the same intermediaries, and not
all buyers and sellers trade at the same price. One example of this
setting is the trade of agricultural goods in developing countries.
Given inadequate transportation networks, and poor farmers" 
limited access to capital, many farmers have no alternative to trading
with middlemen in inefficient local markets. A developing country
may have many such partially overlapping markets existing 
alongside modern efficient markets [2].
Financial markets provide a different example of a setting with
these general characteristics. In these markets much of the trade
between buyers and sellers is intermediated by a variety of agents
ranging from brokers to market makers to electronic trading 
systems. For many assets there is no one market; trade in a single asset
may occur simultaneously on the floor of an exchange, on crossing
networks, on electronic exchanges, and in markets in other 
countries. Some buyers and sellers have access to many or all of these
trading venues; others have access to only one or a few of them.
The price at which the asset trades may differ across these trading
venues. In fact, there is no price as different traders pay or 
receive different prices. In many settings there is also a gap between
the price a buyer pays for an asset, the ask price, and the price a
seller receives for the asset, the bid price. One of the most striking
examples of this phenomenon occurs in the market for foreign 
exchange, where there is an interbank market with restricted access
and a retail market with much more open access. Spreads, defined
as the difference between bid and ask prices, differ significantly
across these markets, even though the same asset is being traded in
the two markets.
In this paper, we develop a framework in which such phenomena
emerge from a game-theoretic model of trade, with buyers, sellers,
and traders interacting on a network. The edges of the network 
connect traders to buyers and sellers, and thus represent the access that
different market participants have to one another. The traders serve
as intermediaries in a two-stage trading game: they strategically
choose bid and ask prices to offer to the sellers and buyers they are
connected to; the sellers and buyers then react to the prices they
face. Thus, the network encodes the relative power in the structural
positions of the market participants, including the implicit levels of
competition among traders. We show that this game always has a
143
subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, and that all equilibria lead to an
efficient (i.e. socially optimal) allocation of goods. We also 
analyze how trader profits depend on the network structure, essentially
characterizing in graph-theoretic terms how a trader"s payoff is 
determined by the amount of competition it experiences with other
traders.
Our work here is connected to several lines of research in 
economics, finance, and algorithmic game theory, and we discuss these
connections in more detail later in the introduction. At a general
level, our approach can be viewed as synthesizing two important
strands of work: one that treats buyer-seller interaction using 
network structures, but without attempting to model the processses by
which prices are actually formed [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13]; and
another strand in the literature on market microstructure that 
incorporates price-setting intermediaries, but without network-type
constraints on who can trade with whom [12]. By developing a 
network model that explicitly includes traders as price-setting agents,
in a system together with buyers and sellers, we are able to capture
price formation in a network setting as a strategic process carried
out by intermediaries, rather than as the result of a centrally 
controlled or exogenous mechanism.
The Basic Model: Indistinguishable Goods. Our goal in 
formulating the model is to express the process of price-setting in 
markets such as those discussed above, where the participants do not
all have uniform access to one another. We are given a set B of
buyers, a set S of sellers, and a set T of traders. There is an 
undirected graph G that indicates who is able to trade with whom. All
edges have one end in B ∪ S and the other in T; that is, each edge
has the form (i, t) for i ∈ S and t ∈ T, or (j, t) for j ∈ B and
t ∈ T. This reflects the constraints that all buyer-seller transactions
go through traders as intermediaries.
In the most basic version of the model, we consider identical
goods, one copy of which is initially held by each seller. Buyers and
sellers each have a value for one copy of the good, and we assume
that these values are common knowledge. We will subsequently
generalize this to a setting in which goods are distinguishable, 
buyers can value different goods differently, and potentially sellers can
value transactions with different buyers differently as well. Having
different buyer valuations captures settings like house purchases;
adding different seller valuations as well captures matching 
markets - for example, sellers as job applicants and buyers as 
employers, with both caring about who ends up with which good
(and with traders acting as services that broker the job search).
Thus, to start with the basic model, there is a single type of good;
the good comes in individisible units; and each seller initially holds
one unit of the good. All three types of agents value money at the
same rate; and each i ∈ B ∪ S additionally values one copy of the
good at θi units of money. No agent wants more than one copy of
the good, so additional copies are valued at 0. Each agent has an
initial endowment of money that is larger than any individual 
valuation θi; the effect of this is to guarantee that any buyer who ends
up without a copy of the good has been priced out of the market
due to its valuation and network position, not a lack of funds.
We picture each good that is sold flowing along a sequence of
two edges: from a seller to a trader, and then from the trader to a
buyer. The particular way in which goods flow is determined by the
following game. First, each trader offers a bid price to each seller
it is connected to, and an ask price to each buyer it is connected
to. Sellers and buyers then choose from among the offers presented
to them by traders. If multiple traders propose the same price to a
seller or buyer, then there is no strict best response for the seller or
buyer. In this case a selection must be made, and, as is standard
(see for example [10]), we (the modelers) choose among the best
offers. Finally, each trader buys a copy of the good from each seller
that accepts its offer, and it sells a copy of the good to each buyer
that accepts its offer. If a particular trader t finds that more buyers
than sellers accept its offers, then it has committed to provide more
copies of the good than it has received, and we will say that this
results in a large penalty to the trader for defaulting; the effect of
this is that in equilibrium, no trader will choose bid and ask prices
that result in a default.
More precisely, a strategy for each trader t is a specification of a
bid price βti for each seller i to which t is connected, and an ask
price αtj for each buyer j to which t is connected. (We can also
handle a model in which a trader may choose not to make an offer
to certain of its adjacent sellers or buyers.) Each seller or buyer
then chooses at most one incident edge, indicating the trader with
whom they will transact, at the indicated price. (The choice of a
single edge reflects the facts that (a) sellers each initially have only
one copy of the good, and (b) buyers each only want one copy of
the good.) The payoffs are as follows:
For each seller i, the payoff from selecting trader t is βti,
while the payoff from selecting no trader is θi. (In the former
case, the seller receives βti units of money, while in the latter
it keeps its copy of the good, which it values at θi.)
For each buyer j, the payoff from selecting trader t is θj −αtj,
whle the payoff from selecting no trader is 0. (In the former
case, the buyer receives the good but gives up αtj units of
money.)
For each trader t, with accepted offers from sellers i1, . . . , is
and buyers j1, . . . , jb, the payoff is
P
r αtjr −
P
r βtir , 
minus a penalty π if b > s. The penalty is chosen to be large
enough that a trader will never incur it in equilibrium, and
hence we will generally not be concerned with the penalty.
This defines the basic elements of the game. The equilibrium 
concept we use is subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.
Some Examples. To help with thinking about the model, we now
describe three illustrative examples, depicted in Figure 1. To keep
the figures from getting too cluttered, we adopt the following 
conventions: sellers are drawn as circles in the leftmost column and
will be named i1, i2, . . . from top to bottom; traders are drawn as
squares in the middle column and will be named t1, t2, . . . from top
to bottom; and buyers are drawn as circles in the rightmost column
and will be named j1, j2, . . . from top to bottom. All sellers in the
examples will have valuations for the good equal to 0; the valuation
of each buyer is drawn inside its circle; and the bid or ask price on
each edge is drawn on top of the edge.
In Figure 1(a), we show how a standard second-price auction
arises naturally from our model. Suppose the buyer valuations from
top to bottom are w > x > y > z. The bid and ask prices shown
are consistent with an equilibrium in which i1 and j1 accept the 
offers of trader t1, and no other buyer accepts the offer of its adjacent
trader: thus, trader t1 receives the good with a bid price of x, and
makes w − x by selling the good to buyer j1 for w. In this way, we
can consider this particular instance as an auction for a single good
in which the traders act as proxies for their adjacent buyers. The
buyer with the highest valuation for the good ends up with it, and
the surplus is divided between the seller and the associated trader.
Note that one can construct a k-unit auction with > k buyers just
as easily, by building a complete bipartite graph on k sellers and
traders, and then attaching each trader to a single distinct buyer.
In Figure 1(b), we show how nodes with different positions in
the network topology can achieve different payoffs, even when all

(c) Implicit perfect competition
Figure 1: (a) An auction, mediated by traders, in which the buyer with the highest valuation for the good ends up with it. (b)
A network in which the middle seller and buyer benefit from perfect competition between the traders, while the other sellers and
buyers have no power due to their position in the network. (c) A form of implicit perfect competition: all bid/ask spreads will be zero
in equilibrium, even though no trader directly competes with any other trader for the same buyer-seller pair.
buyer valuations are the same numerically. Specifically, seller i2
and buyer j2 occupy powerful positions, because the two traders
are competing for their business; on the other hand, the other sellers
and buyers are in weak positions, because they each have only one
option. And indeed, in every equilibrium, there is a real number
x ∈ [0, 1] such that both traders offer bid and ask prices of x to
i2 and j2 respectively, while they offer bids of 0 and asks of 1
to the other sellers and buyers. Thus, this example illustrates a
few crucial ingredients that we will identify at a more general level
shortly. Specifically, i2 and j2 experience the benefits of perfect
competition, in that the two traders drive the bid-ask spreads to 0 in
competing for their business. On the other hand, the other sellers
and buyers experience the downsides of monopoly - they receive
0 payoff since they have only a single option for trade, and the
corresponding trader makes all the profit. Note further how this
natural behavior emerges from the fact that traders are able to offer
different prices to different agents - capturing the fact that there
is no one fixed price in the kinds of markets that motivate the
model, but rather different prices reflecting the relative power of
the different agents involved.
The previous example shows perhaps the most natural way in
which a trader"s profit on a particular transaction can drop to 0:
when there is another trader who can replicate its function 
precisely. (In that example, two traders each had the ability to move
a copy of the good from i2 to j2.) But as our subsequent results
will show, traders make zero profit more generally due to global,
graph-theoretic reasons. The example in Figure 1(c) gives an initial
indication of this: one can show that for every equilibrium, there is
a y ∈ [0, 1] such that every bid and every ask price is equal to y. In
other words, all traders make zero profit, whether or not a copy of
the good passes through them - and yet, no two traders have any
seller-buyer paths in common. The price spreads have been driven
to zero by a global constraint imposed by the long cycle through
all the agents; this is an example of implicit perfect competition
determined by the network topology.
Extending the Model to Distinguishable Goods. We extend the
basic model to a setting with distinguishable goods, as follows. 
Instead of having each agent i ∈ B ∪ S have a single numerical
valuation θi, we index valuations by pairs of buyers and sellers: if
buyer j obtains the good initially held by seller i, it gets a utility of
θji, and if seller i sells its good to buyer j, it experiences a loss of
utility of θij . This generalizes the case of indistinguishable goods,
since we can always have these pairwise valuations depend only on
one of the indices. A strategy for a trader now consists of offering
a bid to each seller that specifies both a price and a buyer, and 
offering an ask to each buyer that specifies both a price and a seller.
(We can also handle a model in which a trader offers bids 
(respectively, asks) in the form of vectors, essentially specifying a menu
with a price attached to each buyer (resp. seller).) Each buyer and
seller selects an offer from an adjacent trader, and the payoffs to all
agents are determined as before.
This general framework captures matching markets [10, 13]: for
example, a job market that is mediated by agents or employment
search services (as in hiring for corporate executives, or sports or
entertainment figures). Here the sellers are job applicants, buyers
are employers, and traders are the agents that mediate the job 
market. Of course, if one specifies pairwise valuations on buyers but
just single valuations for sellers, we model a setting where buyers
can distinguish among the goods, but sellers don"t care whom they
sell to - this (roughly) captures settings like housing markets.
Our Results. Our results will identify general forms of some of
the principles noted in the examples discussed above - including
the question of which buyers end up with the good; the question
of how payoffs are differently realized by sellers, traders, and 
buyers; and the question of what structural properties of the network
determine whether the traders will make positive profits.
To make these precise, we introduce the following notation. Any
outcome of the game determines a final allocation of goods to some
of the agents; this can be specified by a collection M of triples
(ie, te, je), where ie ∈ S, te ∈ T, and je ∈ B; moreover, each
seller and each buyer appears in at most one triple. The meaning is
for each e ∈ M, the good initially held by ie moves to je through
te. (Sellers appearing in no triple keep their copy of the good.)
We say that the value of the allocation is equal to
P
e∈M θjeie −
θieje . Let θ∗
denote the maximum value of any allocation M that
is feasible given the network.
We show that every instance of our game has an equilibrium,
and that in every such equilibrium, the allocation has value θ∗

145
in other words, it achieves the best value possible. Thus, 
equilibria in this model are always efficient, in that the market enables the
right set of people to get the good, subject to the network 
constraints. We establish the existence and efficiency of equilibria by
constructing a linear program to capture the flow of goods through
the network; the dual of this linear program contains enough 
information to extract equilibrium prices.
By the definition of the game, the value of the equilibrium 
allocation is divided up as payoffs to the agents, and it is interesting to
ask how this value is distributed - in particular how much profit a
trader is able to make based on its position in the network. We find
that, although all equilibria have the same value, a given trader"s
payoff can vary across different equilibria. However, we are able
to characterize the maximum and minimum amounts that a given
trader is able to make, where these maxima and minima are taken
over all equilibria, and we give an efficient algorithm to compute
this. In particular, our results here imply a clean combinatorial
characterization of when a given trader t can achieve non-zero 
payoff: this occurs if and only there is some edge e incident to t that is
essential, in the sense that deleting e reduces the value of the 
optimal allocation θ∗
. We also obtain results for the sum of all trader
profits.
Related Work. The standard baseline approach for analyzing the
interaction of buyers and sellers is the Walrasian model in which
anonymous buyers and sellers trade a good at a single market 
clearing price. This reduced form of trade, built on the idealization of a
market price, is a powerful model which has led to many insights.
But it is not a good model to use to examine where prices come
from or exactly how buyers and sellers and trade with each other.
The difficulty is that in the Walrasian model there is no agent who
sets the price, and agents don"t actually trade with each other. In
fact there is no market, in the everyday sense of that word, in the
Walrasian model. That is, there is no physical or virtual place
where buyers and sellers interact to trade and set prices. Thus in
this simple model, all buyers and sellers are uniform and trade at
the same price, and there is also no role for intermediaries.
There are several literatures in economics and finance which 
examine how prices are set rather than just determining equilibrium
prices. The literature on imperfect competition is perhaps the 
oldest of these. Here a monopolist, or a group of oliogopolists, choose
prices in order to maximize their profits (see [14] for the standard
textbook treatment of these markets). A monopolist uses its 
knowledge of market demand to choose a price, or a collection of prices
if it discriminates. Oliogopolists play a game in which their 
payoffs depend on market demand and the actions of their competitors.
In this literature there are agents who set prices, but the fiction of
a single market is maintained. In the equilibrium search literature,
firms set prices and consumers search over them (see [3]). 
Consumers do end up paying different prices, but all consumers have
access to all firms and there are no intermediaries. In the general
equilibrium literature there have been various attempts to introduce
price determination. A standard proof technique for the existence
of competitive equilibrium involves a price adjustment mechanism
in which prices respond to excess demand. The Walrasian 
auctioneer is often introduced as a device to explain how this process
works, but this is a fundamentally a metaphor for an iterative 
priceupdating algorithm, not for the internals of an actual market. More
sophisticated processes have been introduced to study the 
stability of equilibrium prices or the information necessary to compute
them. But again there are no price-setting agents here.
In the finance literature the work on market microstructure does
have price-setting agents (specialists), parts of it do determine 
separate bid and ask prices, and different agents receive different prices
for the same asset (see [12] for a treatment of microstructure 
theory). Work in information economics has identified similar 
phenomena (see e.g. [7]). But there is little research in these literatures
examining the effect of restrictions on who can trade with whom.
There have been several approaches to studying how network
structure determines prices. These have posited price determination
through definitions based on competitive equilibrium or the core, or
through the use of truthful mechanisms. In briefly reviewing this
work, we will note the contrast with our approach, in that we model
prices as arising from the strategic behavior of agents in the system.
In recent work, Kakade et al. [8] have studied the distribution of
prices at competitive equilibrium in a bipartite graph on buyers and
sellers, generated using a probabilistic model capable of producing
heavy-tailed degree distributions [11]. Even-Dar et al. [6] build
on this to consider the strategic aspects of network formation when
prices arise from competitive equilibrium.
Leonard [10], Babaioff et al. [1], and Chu and Shen [4] consider
an approach based on mechanism design: buyers and sellers reside
at different nodes in a graph, and they incur a given 
transportation cost to trade with one another. Leonard studies VCG prices in
this setting; Babaioff et al. and Chu and Shen additionally provide
a a budget-balanced mechanism. Since the concern here is with
truthful mechanisms that operate on private valuations, there is an
inherent trade-off between the efficiency of the allocation and the
budget-balance condition.
In contrast, our model has known valuations and prices arising
from the strategic behavior of traders. Thus, the assumptions 
behind our model are in a sense not directly comparable to those 
underlying the mechanism design approach: while we assume known
valuations, we do not require a centralized authority to impose a
mechanism. Rather, price-setting is part of the strategic outcome,
as in the real markets that motivate our work, and our equilibria
are simultaneously budget-balanced and efficient - something not
possible in the mechanism design frameworks that have been used.
Demange, Gale, and Sotomayor [5], and Kranton and Minehart
[9], analyze the prices at which trade occurs in a network, working
within the framework of mechanism design. Kranton and Minehart
use a bipartite graph with direct links between buyers and sellers,
and then use an ascending auction mechanism, rather than strategic
intermediaries, to determine the prices. Their auction has desirable
equilibrium properties but as Kranton and Minehart note it is an
abstraction of how goods are allocated and prices are determined
that is similar in spirit to the Walrasian auctioneer abstraction. In
fact, we can show how the basic model of Kranton and Minehart
can be encoded as an instance of our game, with traders producing
prices at equilibrium matching the prices produced by their auction
mechanism.1
Finally, the classic results of Shapley and Shubik [13] on the
assignment game can be viewed as studying the result of trade on a
bipartite graph in terms of the core. They study the dual of a linear
program based on the matching problem, similar to what we use for
a reduced version of our model in the next section, but their focus
is different as they do not consider agents that seek to set prices.
