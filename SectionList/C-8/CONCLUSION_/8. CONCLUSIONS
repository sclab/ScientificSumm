We have contributed the theory of operation context and
the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm. The theory of 
operation context is capable of capturing essential relationships
and conditions for all types of operation in an OT system;
it provides a new foundation for better understanding and
resolving OT problems. The COT algorithm provides 
uniformed solutions to both consistency maintenance and undo
problems; it is simpler and more efficient than prior OT 
control algorithms with similar capabilities; and it significantly
simplifies the design of transformation functions. The COT
algorithm has been implemented in a generic collaboration
engine and used for supporting a range of novel collaborative
applications [24].
Real-world applications provide exciting opportunities and
challenges to future OT research. The theory of operation
context and the COT algorithm shall serve as new 
foundations for addressing the technical challenges in existing and
emerging OT applications.
