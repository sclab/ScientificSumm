As mentioned, most tools facilitating expression of multiattribute
value for trading applications assume that agents" preferences can
be represented in an additive form. By way of background, we start
by introducing the formal prerequisites justifying the additive 
representation, as provided by multiattribute utility theory. We then
present the generalized additive form, and develop the formal 
underpinnings for measurable value needed to extend this model to
the case of choice under certainty.
2.1 Preferential Independence
Let Θ denote the space of possible outcomes, with a 
preference relation (weak total order) over Θ. Let A = {a0, . . . , am}
be a set of attributes describing Θ. Capital letters denote subsets
of variables, small letters (with or without numeric subscripts) 
denote specific variables, and ¯X denotes the complement of X with
respect to A. We indicate specific variable assignments with prime
signs or superscripts. To represent an instantiation of subsets X, Y
at the same time we use a sequence of instantiation symbols, as in
X Y .
DEFINITION 1. A set of attributes Y ⊂ A is preferentially 
independent (PI) of its complement Z = A \ Y if the conditional
preference order over Y given a fixed level Z0
of Z is the same
regardless of the choice of Z0
.
In other words, the preference order over the projection of A on the
attributes in Y is the same for any instantiation of the attributes in
Z.
DEFINITION 2. A = {a1, . . . , am} is mutually preferentially
independent (MPI) if any subset of A is preferentially independent
of its complement.
The preference relation when no uncertainty is modeled is 
usually represented by a value function v [17]. The following 
fundamental result greatly simplifies the value function representation.
THEOREM 1 ([9]). A preference order over set of attributes
A has an additive value function representation
v(a1, . . . , am) =
mX
i=1
vi(ai)
iff A is mutually preferential independent.
Essentially, the additive forms used in trading mechanisms assume
mutual preferential independence over the full set of attributes, 
including the money attribute. Intuitively that means that willingness
to pay for value of an attribute or attributes cannot be affected by
the value of other attributes.
A cardinal value function representing an ordering over certain
outcomes need not in general coincide with the cardinal utility
function that represents preference over lotteries or expected utility
(EU). Nevertheless, EU functions may possess structural 
properties analogous to that for value functions, such as additive 
decomposition. Since the present work does not involve decisions under
uncertainty, we do not provide a full exposition of the EU concept.
However we do make frequent reference to the following additive
independence relations.
DEFINITION 3. Let X, Y, Z be a partition of the set of attributes
A. X and Y are conditionally additive independent given Z, 
denoted as CAI(X, Y | Z), if preferences over lotteries on A depend
only on their marginal conditional probability distributions over X
and Y .
DEFINITION 4. Let I1, . . . , Ig ⊆ A such that
Sg
i=1 Ii = A.
I1, . . . , Ig are called generalized additive independent (GAI) if 
preferences over lotteries on A depend only on their marginal 
distributions over I1, . . . , Ig.
An (expected) utility function u(·) can be decomposed additively
according to its (possibly overlapping) GAI sub-configurations.
THEOREM 2 ([13]). Let I1, . . . , Ig be GAI. Then there exist
functions f1, . . . , fg such that
u(a1, . . . , am) =
g
X
r=1
fr(Ir). (1)
What is now known as the GAI condition was originally 
introduced by Fishburn [13] for EU, and was named GAI and brought to
the attention of AI researchers by Bacchus and Grove [1]. 
Graphical models and elicitation procedures for GAI decomposable utility
were developed for EU [4, 14, 6], for a cardinal representation of
the ordinal value function [15], and for an ordinal preference 
relations corresponding to a TCP-net structure by Brafman et al. [5].
Apart from the work on GAI in the context of preference handling
that were discussed above, GAI have been recently used in the 
context of mechanism design by Hyafil and Boutilier [16], as an aid in
direct revelation mechanisms.
As shown by Bacchus and Grove [1], GAI structure can be 
identified based on a set of CAI conditions, which are much easier to
detect and verify. In general, utility functions may exhibit GAI
structure not based on CAI. However, to date all proposals for 
reasoning and eliciting utility in GAI form take advantage of the GAI
structure primarily to the extent that it represents a collection of
CAI conditions. For example, GAI trees [14] employ triangulation
of the CAI map, and Braziunas and Boutilier"s [6] conditional set
Cj of a set Ij corresponds to the CAI separating set of Ij.
Since the CAI condition is also defined based on preferences
over lotteries, we cannot apply Bacchus and Grove"s result 
without first establishing an alternative framework based on priced 
outcomes. We develop such a framework using the theory of 
measurable value functions, ultimately producing a GAI decomposition
228
(Eq. 1) of the wtp function. Readers interested primarily in the
multiattribute auction and willing to grant the well-foundedness of
the preference structure may skip down to Section 5.
2.2 Measurable Value Functions
Trading decisions represent a special case of decisions under 
certainty, where choices involve multiattribute outcomes and 
corresponding monetary payments. In such problems, the key decision
often hinges on relative valuations of price differences compared
to differences in alternative configurations of goods and services.
Theoretically, price can be treated as just another attribute, 
however, such an approach fails to exploit the special character of the
money dimension, and can significantly add to complexity due to
the inherent continuity and typical wide range of possible monetary
outcome values.
We build on the fundamental work of Dyer and Sarin [10, 11] on
measurable value functions (MVFs). As we show below, wtp 
functions in a quasi-linear setting can be interpreted as MVFs. However
we first present the MVF framework in a more generic way, where
the measurement is not necessarily monetary. We present the 
essential definitions and refer to Dyer and Sarin for more detailed
background and axiomatic treatment. The key concept is that of
preference difference. Let θ1
, θ2
, ϑ1
, ϑ2
∈ Θ such that θ1
θ2
and ϑ1
ϑ2
. [θ2
, θ1
] denotes the preference difference between
θ2
and θ1
, interpreted as the strength, or degree, to which θ2
is 
preferred over θ1
. Let ∗
denote a preference order over Θ × Θ. We
interpret the statement
[θ2
, θ1
] ∗
[ϑ2
, ϑ1
]
as the preference of ϑ2
over ϑ1
is at least as strong as the 
preference of θ2
over θ1
. We use the symbol ∼∗
to represent equality of
preference differences.
DEFINITION 5. u : D → is a measurable value function
(MVF) wrt ∗
if for any θ1
, θ2
, ϑ1
, ϑ2
∈ D,
[θ2
, θ1
] ∗
[ϑ2
, ϑ1
] ⇔
u(θ2
) − u(θ1
) ≤ u(ϑ2
) − u(ϑ1
).
Note that an MVF can also be used as a value function representing
, since [θ , θ] ∗
[θ , θ] iff θ θ .
DEFINITION 6 ([11]). Attribute set X ⊂ A is called 
difference independent of ¯X if for any two assignments X1 ¯X X2 ¯X ,
[X1 ¯X , X2 ¯X ] ∼∗
[X1 ¯X , X2 ¯X ]
for any assignment ¯X .
Or, in words, the preference differences on assignments to X given
a fixed level of ¯X do not depend on the particular level chosen for
¯X.
As with additive independence for EU, this condition is stronger
than preferential independence of X. Also analogously to EU,
mutual preferential independence combined with other conditions
leads to additive decomposition of the MVF. Moreover, Dyer and
Sarin [11] have defined analogs of utility independence [17] for
MVF, and worked out a parallel set of decomposition results.
