Multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional, price-only
mechanisms by facilitating the negotiation over a set of predefined
attributes representing various non-price aspects of the deal. Rather
than negotiating over a fully defined good or service, a 
multiattribute mechanism delays commitment to specific configurations
until the most promising candidates are identified. For example,
a procurement department of a company may use a multiattribute
auction to select a supplier of hard drives. Supplier offers may be
evaluated not only over the price they offer, but also over various
qualitative attributes such as volume, RPM, access time, latency,
transfer rate, and so on. In addition, suppliers may offer different
contract conditions such as warranty, delivery time, and service.
In order to account for traders" preferences, the auction 
mechanism must extract evaluative information over a complex domain
of multidimensional configurations. Constructing and 
communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden
for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical 
multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications,
or support compact expression of preferences assuming some 
simplified form. By far the most popular multiattribute form to adopt
is the simplest: an additive representation where overall value is a
linear combination of values associated with each attribute. For 
example, several recent proposals for iterative multiattribute auctions
[2, 3, 8, 19] require additive preference representations.
Such additivity reduces the complexity of preference 
specification exponentially (compared to the general discrete case), but 
precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes. In
practice, however, interdependencies among natural attributes are
quite common. For example, the buyer may exhibit complementary
preferences for size and access time (since the performance effect
is more salient if much data is involved), or may view a strong 
warranty as a good substitute for high reliability ratings. Similarly, the
seller"s production characteristics (such as increasing access time
is harder for larger hard drives) can easily violate additivity. In
such cases an additive value function may not be able to provide
even a reasonable approximation of real preferences.
On the other hand, fully general models are intractable, and it
is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some
structure. Our goal, therefore, is to identify the subtler yet more
widely applicable structured representations, and exploit these 
properties of preferences in trading mechanisms.
We propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a
flexible preference structure. Our approach is inspired by the 
design of an iterative multiattribute procurement auction for additive
preferences, due to Parkes and Kalagnanam (PK) [19]. PK 
propose two types of iterative auctions: the first (NLD) makes no 
assumptions about traders" preferences, and lets sellers bid on the full
multidimensional attribute space. Because NLD maintains an 
exponential price structure, it is suitable only for small domains. The
other auction (AD) assumes additive buyer valuation and seller cost
functions. It collects sell bids per attribute level and for a single 
discount term. The price of a configuration is defined as the sum of
the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount.
The auction we propose also supports compact price spaces, 
albeit for levels of clusters of attributes rather than singletons. We
employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive
independence (GAI), a model flexible enough to accommodate 
interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired, yet 
providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence
can be limited. Given its roots in multiattribute utility theory [13],
227
the GAI condition is defined with respect to the expected utility
function. To apply it for modeling values for certain outcomes,
therefore, requires a reinterpretation for preference under certainty.
To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated
with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing
magnitude of preference.
We first lay out a representation framework for preferences that
captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute 
configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each.
That is, we should be able not only to compare outcomes but also
decide whether the difference in quality is worth a given difference
in price. Next, we build a direct, formally justified link from 
preference statements over priced outcomes to a generalized additive
decomposition of the wtp function. After laying out this 
infrastructure, we employ this representation tool for the development of a
multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to 
express their complex preferences in GAI format. We then study the
auction"s allocational, computational, and practical properties.
In Section 2 we present essential background on our 
representation framework, the measurable value function (MVF). Section 3
develops new multiattribute structures for MVF, supporting 
generalized additive decompositions. Next, we show the applicability of
the theoretical framework to preferences in trading. The rest of the
paper is devoted to the proposed auction mechanism.
