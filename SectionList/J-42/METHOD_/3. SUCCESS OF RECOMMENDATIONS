So far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the
recommendation network. Next, we ask questions about
the effectiveness of recommendations in the 
recommendation network itself. First, we analyze the probability of 
purchasing as one gets more and more recommendations. Next,
we measure recommendation effectiveness as two people 
exchange more and more recommendations. Lastly, we 
observe the recommendation network from the perspective of
the sender of the recommendation. Does a node that makes
more recommendations also influence more purchases?
3.1 Probability of buying versus number of
incoming recommendations
First, we examine how the probability of purchasing changes
as one gets more and more recommendations. One would 
expect that a person is more likely to buy a product if she gets
more recommendations. On the other had one would also
think that there is a saturation point - if a person hasn"t
bought a product after a number of recommendations, they
are not likely to change their minds after receiving even more
of them. So, how many recommendations are too many?
Figure 5 shows the probability of purchasing a product
as a function of the number of incoming recommendations
on the product. As we move to higher numbers of incoming
recommendations, the number of observations drops rapidly.
For example, there were 5 million cases with 1 incoming
recommendation on a book, and only 58 cases where a 
person got 20 incoming recommendations on a particular book.
The maximum was 30 incoming recommendations. For these
reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations
becomes too small and the error bars too large.
Figure 5(a) shows that, overall, book recommendations
are rarely followed. Even more surprisingly, as more and
more recommendations are received, their success decreases.
We observe a peak in probability of buying at 2 incoming
recommendations and then a slow drop.
For DVDs (figure 5(b)) we observe a saturation around 10
incoming recommendations. This means that after a person
gets 10 recommendations on a particular DVD, they 
become immune to them - their probability of buying does
not increase anymore. The number of observations is 2.5
million at 1 incoming recommendation and 100 at 60 
incoming recommendations. The maximal number of received
recommendations is 172 (and that person did not buy)

recommendations.
3.2 Success of subsequent recommendations
Next, we analyze how the effectiveness of 
recommendations changes as two persons exchange more and more 
recommendations. A large number of exchanged 
recommendations can be a sign of trust and influence, but a sender of too
many recommendations can be perceived as a spammer. A
person who recommends only a few products will have her
friends" attention, but one who floods her friends with all
sorts of recommendations will start to loose her influence.
We measure the effectiveness of recommendations as a
function of the total number of previously exchanged 
recommendations between the two nodes. We construct the
experiment in the following way. For every recommendation
r on some product p between nodes u and v, we first 
determine how many recommendations were exchanged between
u and v before recommendation r. Then we check whether v,
the recipient of recommendation, purchased p after 
recommendation r arrived. For the experiment we consider only
node pairs (u, v), where there were at least a total of 10 
recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment
using only recommendations from the same product group.
Figure 6 shows the probability of buying as a function of
the total number of exchanged recommendations between
two persons up to that point. For books we observe that
the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant
up to 3 exchanged recommendations. As the number of 
exchanged recommendations increases, the probability of 
buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and
then levels off. For DVDs we observe an immediate and 
consistent drop. This experiment shows that recommendations
start to lose effect after more than two or three are passed
between two people. We performed the experiment also for
video and music, but the number of observations was too
low and the measurements were noisy.
3.3 Success of outgoing recommendations
In previous sections we examined the data from the 
viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation. Now we look
from the viewpoint of the sender. The two interesting 
questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit
change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and
given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many
purchases will they influence?
One would expect that recommendations would be the
most effective when recommended to the right subset of
friends. If one is very selective and recommends to too few
friends, then the chances of success are slim. One the other
hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with
recommendations may have limited returns as well.
The top row of figure 7 shows how the average number
of purchases changes with the number of outgoing 
recommendations. For books, music, and videos the number of
purchases soon saturates: it grows fast up to around 10 
outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or
starts to drop. DVDs exhibit different behavior, with the
expected number of purchases increasing throughout. But
if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a 
function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the
bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD
recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and
music have qualitatively similar trends. The difference in
the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence
of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10 
recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an
order of magnitude more than other product groups. This
means that many different individuals are recommending to
the same person, and after that person makes a purchase,
even though all of them made a ‘successful recommendation"
