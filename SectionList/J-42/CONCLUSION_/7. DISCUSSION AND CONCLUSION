Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its 
revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that
resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket
of sales that occur through the website. Nevertheless, we
were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how
viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions
made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.
Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that
individuals have equal probability of being infected every
time they interact. Contrary to this we observe that the
probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.
Marketers should take heed that providing excessive 
incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire
by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are
trying to take advantage of.
Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also
often assume that individuals either have a constant 
probability of â€˜converting" every time they interact with an 
infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of
their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold. In both
cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in
an increased likelihood of infection. Instead, we find that
the probability of purchasing a product increases with the
number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates
to a constant and relatively low probability. This means 
individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of
their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.
In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly 
connected individuals play a very important role. For example,
in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes
become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number
of people. But these models assume that a high degree node
has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors
as a low degree node does. In contrast, we find that there
are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the
recommendation network. As a person sends out more and
more recommendations past a certain number for a product,
the success per recommendation declines. This would seem
to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their
friends, but not everybody they know.
We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows
for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few 
products, but reflects well the general tendency of 
recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.
We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and 
effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price,
with more successful recommendations being made on 
technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the
social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.
Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller
and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to
viral marketing. So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the
viral marketing program in general, we found a number of
new insights which we hope will have general applicability
to marketing strategies and to future models of viral 
information spread.
