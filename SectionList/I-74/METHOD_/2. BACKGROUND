We begin by introducing the formal system of 
argumentation that underpins our approach, as well as the 
corresponding terminology and notation, all taken from [2, 8, 17].
A dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two
or more members of a set of agents A. An agent α maintains
a knowledge base, Σα, containing formulas of a propositional
language L and having no deductive closure. Agent α also
maintains the set of its past utterances, called the 
commitment store, CSα. We refer to this as an agent"s public
knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with
other agents. In contrast, the contents of Σα are private
to α.
Note that in the description that follows, we assume that
is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical
equivalence, and we use Δ to denote all the information
available to an agent. Thus in a dialogue between two agents
α and β, Δα = Σα ∪ CSα ∪ CSβ, so the commitment store
CSα can be loosely thought of as a subset of Δα consisting of
the assertions that have been made public. In some dialogue
games, such as those in [18] anything in CSα is either in Σα
or can be derived from it. In other dialogue games, such as

those in [2], CSα may contain things that cannot be derived
from Σα.
Definition 2.1. An argument A is a pair (S, p) where p
is a formula of L and S a subset of Δ such that (i) S is
consistent; (ii) S p; and (iii) S is minimal, so no proper
subset of S satisfying both (1) and (2) exists.
S is called the support of A, written S = Support(A) and p
is the conclusion of A, written p = Conclusion(A). Thus we
talk of p being supported by the argument (S, p).
In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in
A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ,
may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion
of undercutting:
Definition 2.2. Let A1 and A2 be arguments in A(Δ).
A1 undercuts A2 iff ∃¬p ∈ Support(A2) such that p ≡
Conclusion(A1).
In other words, an argument is undercut if and only if there
is another argument which has as its conclusion the negation
of an element of the support for the first argument.
To capture the fact that some beliefs are more strongly
held than others, we assume that any set of beliefs has a
preference order over it. We consider all information 
available to an agent, Δ, to be stratified into non-overlapping
subsets Δ1, . . . , Δn such that beliefs in Δi are all equally
preferred and are preferred over elements in Δj where i > j.
The preference level of a nonempty subset S ⊂ Δ, where
different elements s ∈ S may belong to different layers Δi,
is valued at the highest numbered layer which has a member
in S and is referred to as level(S). In other words, S is only
as strong as its weakest member. Note that the strength of
a belief as used in this context is a separate concept from
the notion of support discussed earlier.
Definition 2.3. Let A1 and A2 be arguments in A(Δ).
A1 is preferred to A2 according to Pref , A1
Pref
A2, iff
level(Support(A1)) > level(Support(A2)). If A1 is 
preferred to A2, we say that A1 is stronger than A2.
We can now define the argumentation system we will use:
Definition 2.4. An argumentation system is a triple:
A(Δ), Undercut, Pref
such that:
• A(Δ) is a set of the arguments built from Δ,
• Undercut is a binary relation representing the defeat
relationship between arguments, Undercut ⊆ A(Δ) ×
A(Δ), and
• Pref is a pre-ordering on A(Δ) × A(Δ).
The preference order makes it possible to distinguish 
different types of relations between arguments:
Definition 2.5. Let A1, A2 be two arguments of A(Δ).
• If A2 undercuts A1 then A1 defends itself against A2
iff A1
Pref
A2. Otherwise, A1 does not defend itself.
• A set of arguments A defends A1 iff for every A2 that
undercuts A1, where A1 does not defend itself against
A2, then there is some A3 ∈ A such that A3 undercuts
A2 and A2 does not defend itself against A3.
We write AUndercut,Pref to denote the set of all non-undercut
arguments and arguments defending themselves against all
their undercutting arguments. The set A(Δ) of acceptable
arguments of the argumentation system
A(Δ), Undercut, Pref
is [1] the least fixpoint of a function F:
A ⊆ A(Δ)
F(A) = {(S, p) ∈ A(Δ) | (S, p) is defended by A}
Definition 2.6. The set of acceptable arguments for an
argumentation system A(Δ), Undercut, Pref is recursively
defined as:
A(Δ) =
[
Fi≥0(∅)
= AUndercut,Pref ∪
h[
Fi≥1(AUndercut,Pref )
i
An argument is acceptable if it is a member of the acceptable
set, and a proposition is acceptable if it is the conclusion of
an acceptable argument.
An acceptable argument is one which is, in some sense,
proven since all the arguments which might undermine it
are themselves undermined.
Definition 2.7. If there is an acceptable argument for a
proposition p, then the status of p is accepted, while if there
is not an acceptable argument for p, the status of p is not
accepted.
Argument A is said to affect the status of another argument
A if changing the status of A will change the status of A .
