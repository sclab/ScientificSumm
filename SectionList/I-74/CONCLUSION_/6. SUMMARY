This paper has studied the different ideas of relevance in
argumentation-based dialogue, identifying the relationship
between these ideas, and showing how they can impact the
extent to which the way that agents choose moves in a 
dialogue - what some authors have called the strategy and
tactics of a dialogue. This extends existing work on 
relvance, such as [3, 15] by showing how different notions of
relevance can have an effect on the outcome of a dialogue,
in particular when they render the outcome predetermined.
This connection extends the work of [18] which considered
dialogue outcome, but stopped short of identifying the 
conditions under which it is predetermined.
There are two ways we are currently trying to extend this
work, both of which will generalise the results and extend its
applicability. First, we want to relax the restrictions that
1012 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
we have imposed, the exclusion of moves that attack 
several arguments (without which the argument graph can be
mulitply-connected) and the exclusion of pre-empted moves,
without which the argument graph can have cycles. 
Second, we want to extend the ideas of relevance to cope with
moves that do not only add undercutting arguments, but
also supporting arguments, thus taking account of bipolar
argumentation frameworks [5].
