VALUE
In this section, we define the coalitional cost of this game
and analyze the solution proposed by the Shapley value.
Given a queue q ∈ Q, the cost of a coalition of S ⊆ N jobs
in the queue is defined as the cost incurred by jobs in S if
these are the only jobs served in the queue using an efficient
ordering. Formally, the cost of a coalition S ⊆ N is,
C(S) =
 
i∈S
 
j∈S:σ∗
j ≤σ∗
i
θjpj,
where σ∗
= σ∗
(S) is an efficient ordering considering jobs
from S only. The worth of a coalition of S jobs is just
−C(S). Maniquet [15] observes another equivalent way to
define the worth of a coalition is using the dual function of
the cost function C(·). Other interesting ways to define the
worth of a coalition in such games is discussed by Chun [1],
who assume that a coalition of jobs are served after the jobs
not in the coalition are served.
The Shapley value (or cost share) of a job i is defined as,
SVi =
 
S⊆N\{i}
|S|!(|N| − |S| − 1)!
|N|!
¡C(S∪{i})−C(S)¢. (1)
The Shapley value allocation rule says that jobs are ordered
using an efficient ordering and transfers are assigned to jobs
such that the cost share of job i is given by Equation 1.
Lemma 3. Let σ∗
be an efficient ordering of jobs in set
N. For all i ∈ N, the Shapley value is given by,
SVi = piθi +

¡Li + Ri¢,
where Li = θi £j∈Pi(σ∗) pj and Ri = pi £j∈Fi(σ∗) θj.
Proof. Another way to write the Shapley value formula
is the following [10],
SVi =
 
S⊆N:i∈S
∆(S)
|S|
,
where ∆(S) = C(S) if |S| = 1 and ∆(S) = C(S)−£T S ∆(T).
This gives ∆({i}) = C({i}) = piθi ∀i ∈ N. For any i, j ∈ N
with i = j, we have
∆({i, j}) = C({i, j}) − C({i}) − C({j})
= min(piθi + pjθj + pjθi, piθi + pjθj + piθj)
− piθi − pjθj
= min(pjθi, piθj).
We will show by induction that ∆(S) = 0 if |S| > 2. For
|S| = 3, let S = {i, j, k}. Without loss of generality, assume
θi
pi

θj
pj
≥ θk
pk
. So, ∆(S) = C(S) − ∆({i, j}) − ∆({j, k}) −
∆({i, k})−∆({i})−∆({j})−∆({k}) = C(S)−piθj −pjθk −
piθk − piθi − pjθj − pkθk = C(S) − C(S) = 0.
Now, assume for T S, ∆(T) = 0 if |T| > 2. Without
loss of generality assume that σ to be the identity mapping.
Now,
∆(S) = C(S) −

j∈S:j<i
pjθi −
 
i∈S

This proves that ∆(S) = 0 if |S| > 2. Using the Shapley
value formula now,
