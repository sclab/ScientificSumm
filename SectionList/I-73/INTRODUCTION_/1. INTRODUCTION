Open multiagent systems (MAS) are composed of autonomous
distributed agents that may enter and leave the agent society at
their will because open systems have no centralized control over
the development of its parts [1]. Since agents are considered as
autonomous entities, we cannot assume that there is a way to
control their internal behavior. These features are interesting to
obtain flexible and adaptive systems but they also create new risks
about the reliability and the robustness of the system. Solutions to
this problem have been proposed by the way of trust models
where agents are endowed with a model of other agents that
allows them to decide if they can or cannot trust another agent.
Such trust decision is very important because it is an essential
condition to the formation of agents' cooperation. The trust
decision processes use the concept of reputation as the basis of a
decision. Reputation is a subject that has been studied in several
works [4][5][8][9] with different approaches, but also with
different semantics attached to the reputation concept. Casare and
Sichman [2][3] proposed a Functional Ontology of Reputation
(FORe) and some directions about how it could be used to allow
the interoperability among different agent reputation models. This
paper describes how the FORe can be applied to allow
interoperability among agents that have different reputation
models. An outline of this approach is sketched in the context of a
testbed for the experimentation and comparison of trust models,
the ART testbed [6].
