In this paper we present a proposal for reducing the
incompatibility between reputation models by using a general
agent architecture for reputation interaction which relies on a
functional ontology of reputation (FORe), used as a globally
shared reputation model. A reputation mapping module allows
agents to translate information from their internal reputation
model into the shared model and vice versa. The ART testbed has
been enriched to use the ontology during agent transactions. Some
scenarios were described to illustrate our proposal and they seem
to be a promising way to improve the process of building
reputation just using existing technologies.
