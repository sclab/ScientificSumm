REPUTATION (FORe)
In the last years several computational models of reputation have
been proposed [7][10][13][14]. As an example of research
produced in the MAS field we refer to three of them: a cognitive
reputation model [5], a typology of reputation [7] and the
reputation model used in the ReGret system [9][10]. Each model
includes its own specific concepts that may not exist in other
models, or exist with a different name. For instance, Image and
Reputation are two central concepts in the cognitive reputation
model. These concepts do not exist in the typology of reputation
or in the ReGret model. In the typology of reputation, we can find
some similar concepts such as direct reputation and indirect
reputation but there are some slight semantic differences. In the
same way, the ReGret model includes four kinds of reputation
(direct, witness, neighborhood and system) that overlap with the
concepts of other models but that are not exactly the same.
The Functional Ontology of Reputation (FORe) was defined as a
common semantic basis that subsumes the concepts of the main
reputation models. The FORe includes, as its kernel, the following
concepts: reputation nature, roles involved in reputation formation
and propagation, information sources for reputation, evaluation of
reputation, and reputation maintenance. The ontology concept
ReputationNature is composed of concepts such as
IndividualReputation, GroupReputation and ProductReputation.
Reputation formation and propagation involves several roles,
played by the entities or agents that participate in those processes.
The ontology defines the concepts ReputationProcess and
ReputationRole. Moreover, reputation can be classified according
to the origin of beliefs and opinions that can derive from several
sources. The ontology defines the concept ReputationType which
can be PrimaryReputation or SecondaryReputation.
PrimaryReputation is composed of concepts ObservedReputation
and DirectReputation and the concept SecondaryReputation is
composed of concepts such as PropagatedReputation and
CollectiveReputation. More details about the FORe can be found
on [2][3].
