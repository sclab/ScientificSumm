MODELS TO THE FORe
Visser et al [12] suggest three different ways to support semantic
integration of different sources of information: a centralized
approach, where each source of information is related to one
common domain ontology; a decentralized approach, where every
source of information is related to its own ontology; and a hybrid
approach, where every source of information has its own ontology
and the vocabulary of these ontologies are related to a common
ontology. This latter organizes the common global vocabulary in
order to support the source ontologies comparison. Casare and
Sichman [3] used the hybrid approach to show that the FORe
serves as a common ontology for several reputation models.
Therefore, considering the ontologies which describe the agent
reputation models we can define a mapping between these
ontologies and the FORe whenever the ontologies use a common
vocabulary. Also, the information concerning the mappings
between the agent reputation models and the FORe can be directly
inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the
integration of a given reputation model ontology and the FORe in
an ontology tool with reasoning engine.
For instance, a mapping between the Cognitive Reputation Model
ontology and the FORe relates the concepts Image and Reputation
to PrimaryReputation and SecondaryReputation from FORe,
respectively. Also, a mapping between the Typology of
Reputation and the FORe relates the concepts Direct Reputation
and Indirect Reputation to PrimaryReputation and
SecondaryReputation from FORe, respectively. Nevertheless, the
concepts Direct Trust and Witness Reputation from the Regret
System Reputation Model are mapped to PrimaryReputation and
PropagatedReputation from FORe. Since PropagatedReputation is
a sub-concept of SecondaryReputation, it can be inferred that
Witness Reputation is also mapped to SecondaryReputation.
