EDAS has three major components: Every node that 
actively supports decentralized adaptive services provides a
home environment. The home environment basically 
manages resources of one or more nodes belonging to the same
administrative domain or institution. The service 
environment is spread over a set of domains that support a certain
project and relies on basic services from the corresponding
home environments. The service environment supports the
execution of services belonging to the same project. Finally,
the decentralized adaptive service is dynamically distributed
within the scope of an associated service environment.
The home environment has the role of a mediator between
the nodes of an institution and one or more service 
environments, each running a set of services. Fig. 2 shows three
domains each running a home environment that spans all
nodes of the respective domains. Every node provides a set
of resources. Each domain has a manager who can use that
home environment to assign resources to service 
environments and to revoke them. Apart from providing system
load and all kinds of resource-usage information to the 
service environment, the home environment also notifies about
all important system events like a node shutdown or crash.
A service environment represents a scope of distribution
for one or more services. Usually, a service environment is
owned by one organization or community and dedicated to
one project. A service manager can start, stop, and 
configure services through the interface of the service environment
and decides which resources provided by home environments
are accepted.
In most cases a service environment is spread over more
than one administrative domain as shown in Fig. 2. One
of the main tasks of the service environment is to support
the migration of services or service components especially
between different home environments. The service 
environment thereby takes available resources, the requirements of
the services, and the policies provided by the service 
manager into account. The migration of service components can
be necessary for various reasons, like node shutdown, 
resource constraints, and the growth or shrinkage of a service
environment.
