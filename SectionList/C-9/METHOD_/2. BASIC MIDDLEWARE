The EDAS environment is based on the AspectIX 
middleware. At its core, it provides a CORBA-compliant ORB
and, as such, supports heterogeneous distributed systems.
Furthermore AspectIX supports the fragmented object model
[5] that is used to implement and provide decentralized 
adaptive services.
In the fragmented object model, the distinction between
client stubs and the server object is no longer present (Fig.
1). From an abstract point of view, a fragmented object is
a unit with unique identity, interface, behavior, and state,
like in classic object-oriented design. The implementation of
these properties however is not bound to a specific location,
but may be distributed arbitrarily on various fragments.
Any client that wants to access the fragmented object needs
a local fragment, which provides an interface identical to
that of a traditional stub. However internal distribution and
interaction is not only transparent on the outer interface of
the distributed object, but may even change dynamically at
runtime. This allows the fragmented object model to adapt
to changing environment conditions or quality of service 
requirements. It offers to change the service model on 
demand from traditional client-server to a peer-to-peer based
approach and all kind of intermediate stages by migration
and exchanging of fragments.
