Grid infrastructures like the Globus-Toolkit [11] provide
services and mechanisms for distributed heterogeneous 
environments to combine resources on demand to solve resource
consuming and compute intensive tasks. Due to this 
orientation they focus on different service models, provide no
support for object mobility if even supporting a distributed
object approach at all. But most important they follow a
different resource management approach as they target the
parallel execution of a large number of short and midterm
tasks.
JavaSymphony [12] and Ibis [13] provide object mobility
but are limited to the Java programming language and focus
on object oriented high performance computing.
Actively replicated objects are provided by Jgroup [14]
based on RMI. On top of this basic middleware a replication
management layer has been implemented called ARM [15].
JGroup focus on the active replication of objects but lacks
support for more flexible services like EDAS does. ARM
can be compared to EDAS but supports no resource aware
distribution.
Fog [16] and Globe [17] are basic middleware environments
that support the fragmented object approach. Globe 
considers replication and caching. Both systems lack support
for resource aware distribution.
