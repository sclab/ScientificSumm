As was mentioned in the Introduction, market 
microstructure is an important and timely topic both in academic 
finance and on Wall Street, and consequently has a large and
varied recent literature. Here we have space only to 
summarize the main themes of this literature and to provide
pointers to further readings. To our knowledge the stability
properties of detailed limit order microstructure dynamics
have not been previously considered. (However, see Farmer
and Joshi [6] for an example and survey of other price 
dynamic stability studies.)

On the more theoretical side, there is a rich line of work 
examining what might be considered the game-theoretic 
properties of limit order markets. These works model traders
and market-makers (who provide liquidity by offering both
buy and sell quotes, and profit on the difference) by utility
functions incorporating tolerance for risks of price 
movement, large positions and other factors, and examine the
resulting equilibrium prices and behaviors. Common 
findings predict negative price impacts for large trades, and price
effects for large inventory holdings by market-makers. An
excellent and comprehensive survey of results in this area
can be found in [2].
There is a similarly large body of empirical work on 
microstructure. Major themes include the measurement of
price impacts, statistical properties of limit order books, and
attempts to establish the informational value of order books
[4]. A good overview of the empirical work can be found in
[7]. Of particular note for our interests is [3], which 
empirically studies the distribution of arriving limit order prices in
several prominent markets. This work takes a view of 
arriving prices analogous to our relative model, and establishes
a power-law form for the resulting distributions.
There is also a small but growing number of works 
examining market microstructure topics from a computer 
science perspective, including some focused on the use of 
microstructure in algorithms for optimized trade execution.
Kakade et al. [9] introduced limit order dynamics in 
competitive analysis for one-way and volume-weighted average
price (VWAP) trading. Some recent papers have applied 
reinforcement learning methods to trade execution using order
book properties as state variables [1, 5, 10].
