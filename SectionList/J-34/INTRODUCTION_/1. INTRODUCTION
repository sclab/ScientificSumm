In recent years there has been an explosive increase in
the automation of modern equity markets. This increase
has taken place both in the exchanges, which are 
increasingly computerized and offer sophisticated interfaces for 
order placement and management, and in the trading 
activity itself, which is ever more frequently undertaken by 
software. The so-called Electronic Communication Networks (or
ECNs) that dominate trading in NASDAQ stocks are a 
common example of the automation of the exchanges. On the
trading side, computer programs now are entrusted not only
with the careful execution of large block trades for clients
(sometimes referred to on Wall Street as program trading),
but with the autonomous selection of stocks, direction (long
or short) and volumes to trade for profit (commonly referred
to as statistical arbitrage).
The vast majority of equity trading is done via the 
standard limit order market mechanism. In this mechanism,
continuous trading takes place via the arrival of limit 
orders specifying whether the party wishes to buy or sell, the
volume desired, and the price offered. Arriving limit orders
that are entirely or partially executable with the best offers
on the other side are executed immediately, with any 
volume not immediately executable being placed in an queue
(or book) ordered by price on the appropriate side (buy or
sell). (A detailed description of the limit order mechanism is
given in Section 3.) While traders have always been able to
view the prices at the top of the buy and sell books (known
as the bid and ask), a relatively recent development in 
certain exchanges is the real-time revelation of the entire order
book - the complete distribution of orders, prices and 
volumes on both sides of the exchange. With this revelation
has come the opportunity - and increasingly, the 
needfor modeling and exploiting limit order data and 
dynamics. It is fair to say that market microstructure, as this area
is generally known, is a topic commanding great interest
both in the real markets and in the academic finance 
literature. The opportunities and needs span the range from
the optimized execution of large trades to the creation of
stand-alone proprietary strategies that attempt to profit
from high-frequency microstructure signals.
In this paper we investigate a previously unexplored but
fundamental aspect of limit order microstructure: the 
stability properties of the dynamics. Specifically, we are 
interested in the following natural question: To what extent
are simple models of limit order markets either susceptible
or immune to butterfly effects - that is, the infliction of
large changes in important activity statistics (such as the
120
number of shares traded or the average price per share) by
only minor perturbations of the order sequence?
To examine this question, we consider two stylized but
natural models of the limit order arrival process. In the 
absolute price model, buyers and sellers arrive with limit order
prices that are determined independently of the current state
of the market (as represented by the order books), though
they may depend on all manner of exogenous information
or shocks, such as time, news events, announcements from
the company whose shares are being traded, private signals
or state of the individual traders, etc. This process models
traditional fundamentals-based trading, in which market
participants each have some inherent but possibly varying
valuation for the good that in turn determines their limit
price.
In contrast, in the relative price model, traders express
their limit order prices relative to the best price offered in
their respective book (buy or sell). Thus, a buyer would
encode their limit order price as an offset ∆ (which may be
positive, negative, or zero) from the current bid pb, which is
then translated to the limit price pb +∆. Again, in addition
to now depending on the state of the order books, prices
may also depend on all manner of exogenous information.
The relative price model can be viewed as modeling traders
who, in addition to perhaps incorporating fundamental 
external information on the stock, may also position their 
orders strategically relative to the other orders on their side
of the book. A common example of such strategic 
behavior is known as penny-jumping on Wall Street, in which
a trader who has in interest in buying shares quickly, but
still at a discount to placing a market order, will 
deliberately position their order just above the current bid. More
generally, the entire area of modern execution optimization
[9, 10, 8] has come to rely heavily on the careful positioning
of limit orders relative to the current order book state. Note
that such positioning may depend on more complex features
of the order books than just the current bid and ask, but
the relative model is a natural and simplified starting point.
We remark that an alternate view of the two models is that
all traders behave in a relative manner, but with absolute
traders able to act only on a considerably slower time scale
than the faster relative traders.
How do these two models differ? Clearly, given any fixed
sequence of arriving limit order prices, we can choose to 
express these prices either as their original (absolute) values,
or we can run the order book dynamical process and 
transform each order into a relative difference with the top of
its book, and obtain identical results. The differences arise
when we consider the stability question introduced above.
Intuitively, in the absolute model a small perturbation in
the arriving limit price sequence should have limited (but
still some) effects on the subsequent evolution of the order
books, since prices are determined independently. For the
relative model this intuition is less clear. It seems possible
that a small perturbation could (for example) slightly 
modify the current bid, which in turn could slightly modify the
price of the next arriving order, which could then slightly
modify the price of the subsequent order, and so on, leading
to an amplifying sequence of events.
Our main results demonstrate that these two models do
indeed have dramatically different stability properties. We
first show that for any fixed sequence of prices in the 
absolute model, the modification of a single order has a bounded
and extremely limited impact on the subsequent evolution
of the books. In particular, we define a natural notion of
distance between order books and show that small 
modifications can result in only constant distance to the original
books for all subsequent time steps. We then show that this
implies that for almost any standard statistic of market 
activity - the executed volume, the average price execution
price, and many others - the statistic can be influenced
only infinitesimally by small perturbations.
In contrast, we show that the relative model enjoys no
such stability properties. After giving specific (worst-case)
relative price sequences in which small perturbations 
generate large changes in basic statistics (for example, altering the
number of shares traded by a factor of two), we proceed to
demonstrate that the difference in stability properties of the
two models is more than merely theoretical. Using 
extensive INET (a major ECN for NASDAQ stocks) limit order
data and order book reconstruction code, we investigate the
empirical stability properties when the data is interpreted
as containing either absolute prices, relative prices, or 
mixtures of the two. The theoretical predictions of stability and
instability are strongly borne out by the subsequent 
experiments.
In addition to stability being of fundamental interest in
any important dynamical system, we believe that the 
results described here provide food for thought on the 
topics of market impact and the backtesting of quantitative
trading strategies (the attempt to determine hypothetical
past performance using historical data). They suggest that
one"s confidence that trading quietly and in small 
volumes will have minimal market impact is linked to an 
implicit belief in an absolute price model. Our results and the
fact that in the real markets there is a large and increasing
amount of relative behavior such as penny-jumping would
seem to cast doubts on such beliefs. Similarly, in a purely or
largely relative-price world, backtesting even low-frequency,
low-volume strategies could result in historical estimates of
performance that are not only unrelated to future 
performance (the usual concern), but are not even accurate 
measures of a hypothetical past.
The outline of the paper follows. In Section 2 we briefly
review the large literature on market microstructure. In
Section 3 we describe the limit order mechanism and our
formal models. Section 4 presents our most important 
theoretical results, the 1-Modification Theorem for the absolute
price model. This theorem is applied in Section 5 to derive a
number of strong stability properties in the absolute model.
Section 6 presents specific examples establishing the 
worstcase instability of the relative model. Section 7 contains
the simulation studies that largely confirm our theoretical
findings on INET market data.
