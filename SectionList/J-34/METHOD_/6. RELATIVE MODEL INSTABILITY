In the relative model the underlying assumption is that
traders try to exploit their knowledge of the books to 
strategically place their orders. Thus if a trader wants her buy
order to be executed quickly, she may position it above the
current bid and be the first in the queue; if the trader is 
patient and believes that the price trend is going to be 
downward she will place orders deeper in the buy book, and so
on.
While in the previous sections we showed stability results
for the absolute model, here we provide simple examples
which show instability in the relative model for the 
executed volume, last bid, last ask, average execution price and
the last execution price. In Section 7 we provide many 
simulations on actual market data that demonstrate that this
instability is inherent to the relative model, and not due
to artificial constructions. In the relative model we assume
that for every sequence the ask and bid are always defined,
so the books have a non-empty initial configuration.

We begin by showing that in the relative model, even a
single modification can double the number of shares 
executed.
Theorem 6.1. There is a sequence Σ and a 1-modification
Σ of Σ such that volume(Σ ) ≥ 2volume(Σ).
Proof. For concreteness we assume that at the 
beginning the ask is 10 and the bid is 8. The sequence Σ is
composed from n buy orders with ∆ = 0, followed by n sell
orders with ∆ = 0, and finally an alternating sequence of
buy orders with ∆ = +1 and sell orders with ∆ = −1 of
length 2n. Since the books before the alternating sequence
contain n + 1 sell orders at 10 and n + 1 buy orders at 8, we
have that each pair of buy sell order in the alternating part
is matched and executed, but none of the initial 2n orders
is executed, and thus volume(Σ) = n. Now we change the
first buy order to have ∆ = +1. After the first 2n orders
there are still no executions; however, the books are 
different. Now there are n + 1 sell orders at 10, n buy orders at 9
and one buy order at 8. Now each order in the alternating
sequence is executed with one of the former orders and we
have volume(Σ ) = 2n.
The next theorem shows that the spread-based stability
results of Section 5.1 do not also hold in the relative model.
Before providing the proof, we give its intuition. At the 
beginning the sell book contains only two prices which are far
apart and both contain only two orders, now several buy
orders arrive, at the original sequence they are not being
executed, while in the modified sequence they will be 
executed and leave the sell book with only the orders at the high
price. Now many sell orders followed by many buy orders
will arrive, such that in the original sequence they will be
executed only at the low price and in the modified sequence
they will executed at the high price.
Theorem 6.2. For any positive numbers s and x, there
is sequence Σ such that s2(Σ) = s and a 1-modification Σ
of Σ such that
• |close(Σ) − close(Σ )| ≥ x
• |average(Σ) − average(Σ )| ≥ x
• |lastbid(Σ) − lastbid(Σ )| ≥ x
• |lastask(Σ) − lastask(Σ )| ≥ x
Proof. Without loss of generality let us consider sequences
in which all prices are integer-valued, in which case the
smallest possible value for the second spread is 1; we provide
the proof for the case s2(Σ) = 2, but the s2(Σ) = 1 case is
similar.
We consider a sequence Σ such that after an initialization
period there have been no executions, the buy book has
2 orders at price 10, and the sell book has two orders at
price 12 and 2 orders with value 12+y, where y is a positive
integer that will be determined by the analysis. The original
sequence Σ is a buy order with ∆ = 0, followed by two
buy orders with ∆ = +1, then 2y sell orders with ∆ = 0,
and then 2y buy orders with ∆ = +1. We first note that
s2(Σ) = 2, there are 2y executions, all at price 12, the last
bid is 11 and the last ask is 12. Next we analyze a modified
sequence. We change the first buy order from ∆ = 0 to
∆ = +1. Therefore, the next two buy orders with ∆ = +1
are executed, and afterwards we have that the bid is 11 and
the ask is 12 + y. Now the 2y sell orders are accumulated at
12+y, and after the next y buy orders the bid is at 12+y−1.
Therefore, at the end we have that lastbid(Σ ) = 12 + y − 1,
lastask(Σ ) = 12 + y, close(Σ ) = 12 + y, and average(Σ ) =
y
y+2
(12 + y) + 2
y+2
(12). Setting y = x + 2, we obtain the
lemma for every property.
We note that while this proof was based on the fact that
there are two consecutive orders in the books which are far
(y) apart, we can provide a slightly more complicated 
example in which all orders are close (at most 2 apart), yet still
one change results in large differences.
