In this section we apply the 1-Modification Theorem to
show strong stability properties for the absolute model. We
begin with an examination of the executed volume.
Lemma 5.1. Let Σ be any sequence and Σ be any 
1modification of Σ. Then the set of the executed orders (ID
numbers) generated by the two sequences differs by at most
2.
Proof. By Theorem 4.1 we know that at each stage the
books differ by at most two orders. Now since the union of
the IDs of the executed orders and the order books is always
identical for both sequences, this implies that the executed
orders can differ by at most two.
Corollary 5.2. Let Σ be any sequence and Σ be any 
kmodification of Σ. Then the set of the executed orders (ID
numbers) generated by the two sequences differs by at most
2k.
An order sequence Σ is a k-extension of Σ if Σ can be
obtained by deleting any k orders in Σ .
Lemma 5.3. Let Σ be any sequence and let Σ be any 
kextension of Σ. Then the set of the executed orders generated
by Σ and Σ differ by at most 2k.
This lemma is the key to obtain our main absolute model
volume result below. We use edit(Σ, Σ ) to denote the 
standard edit distance between the sequences Σ and Σ - the
minimal number of substitutions, insertions and deletions or
orders needed to change Σ to Σ .
Theorem 5.4. Let Σ and Σ be any absolute model order
sequences. Then if edit(Σ, Σ ) ≤ k, the set of the executed
orders generated by Σ and Σ differ by at most 4k. In 
particular, |volume(Σ) − volume(Σ )| ≤ 4k.
Proof. We first define the sequence ˜Σ which is the 
intersection of Σ and Σ . Since Σ and Σ are at most k apart,we
have that by k insertions we change ˜Σ to either Σ or Σ , and
by Lemma 5.3 its set of executed orders is at most 2k from
each. Thus the set of executed orders in Σ and Σ is at most
4k apart.

5.1 Spread Bounds
Theorem 5.4 establishes strong stability for executed 
volume in the absolute model. We now turn to the quantities
that involve execution prices as opposed to volume alone
- namely, average(Σ), close(Σ), lastbid(Σ) and lastask(Σ).
For these results, unlike executed volume, a condition must
hold on Σ in order for stability to occur. This condition
is expressed in terms of a natural measure of the spread of
the market, or the gap between the buyers and sellers. We
motivate this condition by first showing that without it, by
changing one order, we can change average(Σ) by any 
positive value x.
Lemma 5.5. There exists Σ such that for any x ≥ 0,
there is a 1-modification Σ of Σ such that average(Σ ) =
average(Σ) + x.
Proof. Let Σ be a sequence of alternating sell and buy
orders in which each seller offers p and each buyer p + x,
and the first order is a sell. Then all executions take place
at the ask, which is always p, and thus average(Σ) = p.
Now suppose we modify only the first sell order to be at
price p+1+x. This initial sell order will never be executed,
and now all executions take place at the bid, which is always
p + x.
Similar instability results can be shown to hold for the
other price-based quantities. This motivates the 
introduction of a quantity we call the second spread of the order
books, which is defined as the difference between the prices
of the second order in the sell book and the second order in
the buy book (as opposed to the bid-ask difference, which is
commonly called the spread). We note that in a liquid stock,
such as those we examine experimentally in Section 7, the
second spread will typically be quite small and in fact almost
always equal to the spread.
In this subsection we consider changes in the sequence
only after an initialization period, and sequences such that
the second spread is always defined after the time we make a
change. We define s2(Σ) to be the maximum second spread
in the sequence Σ following the change.
Theorem 5.6. Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any 
1modification of Σ. Then
1. |lastbid(Σ) − lastbid(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ)
2. |lastask(Σ) − lastask(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ)
where s2(Σ) is the maximum over the second spread in Σ
following the 1-modification.
Proof. We provide the proof for the last bid; the proof
for the last ask is similar. The proof relies on Theorem 4.1
and considers states in the stable set S. For states ab and ¯ab,
we have that the bid is identical. Let bid(X), sb(X), ask(X),
be the bid, the second highest buy order, and the ask of a
sequence X. Now recall that in state a¯b we have that the sell
books are identical, and that the two buy books are identical
except one different order. Thus
bid(Σ)+s2(Σ) ≥ sb(Σ)+s2(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ) = ask(Σ ) ≥ bid(Σ ).
Now it remains to bound bid(Σ). Here we use the fact that
the bid of the modified sequence is at least the second 
highest buy order in the original sequence, due to the fact that
the books are different only in one order. Since
bid(Σ ) ≥ sb(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ) − s2(Σ) ≥ bid(Σ) − s2(Σ)
we have that |bid(Σ) − bid(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ) as desired.
In state ¯a¯b we have that for one sequence the books 
contain an additional buy order and an additional sell order.
First suppose that the books containing the additional 
orders are the original sequence Σ. Now if the bid is not the
additional order we are done, otherwise we have the 
following:
bid(Σ) ≤ ask(Σ) ≤ sb(Σ) + s2(Σ) = bid(Σ ) + s2(Σ),
where sb(Σ) ≤ bid(Σ ) since the original buy book has only
one additional order.
Now assume that the books with the additional orders are
for the modified sequence Σ . We have
bid(Σ) + s2(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ ) ≥ bid(Σ ),
where we used the fact that ask(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ ) since the
modified sequence has an additional order. Similarly we
have that bid(Σ) ≤ bid(Σ ) since the modified buy book
contains an additional order.
We note that the proof of Theorem 5.6 actually establishes
that the bid and ask of the original and modified sequences
are within s2(Σ) at all times.
Next we provide a technical lemma which relates the (first)
spread of the modified sequence to the second spread of the
original sequence.
Lemma 5.7. Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any 
1modification of Σ. Then the spread of Σ is bounded by
s2(Σ).
Proof. By the 1-Modification Theorem, we know that
the books of the modified sequence and the original sequence
can differ by at most one order in each book (buy and sell).
Therefore, the second-highest buy order in the original 
sequence is always at most the bid in the modified sequence,
and the second-lowest sell order in the original sequence is
always at least the ask of the modified sequence.
We are now ready to state a stability result for the average
execution price in the absolute model. It establishes that in
highly liquid markets, where the executed volume is large
and the spread small, the average price is highly stable.
Theorem 5.8. Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any 
1modification of Σ. Then
|average(Σ) − average(Σ )| ≤
2(pmax + s2(Σ))
volume(Σ)
+ s2(Σ)
where pmax is the highest execution price in Σ.
Proof. The proof will show that every execution in Σ
besides the execution of the modified order and the last 
execution has a matching execution in Σ with a price different
by at most s2(Σ), and will use the fact that pmax + s2(Σ) is
a bound on the price in Σ .
Referring to the proof of the 1-Modification Theorem, 
suppose we are in state ¯a¯b, where we have in one sequence
(which can be either Σ or Σ ) an additional buy order b
and an additional sell order a. Without loss of generality
we assume that the sequence with the additional orders is
Σ. If the next execution does not involve a or b then clearly
we have the same execution in both Σ and Σ . Suppose
that it involves a; there are two possibilities. Either a is the
modified order, in which case we change the average price
125
difference by (pmax +s2(Σ))/volume(Σ), and this can happen
only once; or a was executed before in Σ and the executions
both involve an order whose limit price is a. By Lemma 5.7
the spread of both sequences is bounded by s2(Σ), which
implies that the price of the execution in Σ was at most
a + s2(Σ), while execution is in Σ is at price a, and thus the
prices are different by at most s2(Σ).
In states ¯ab, a¯b as long as we have concurrent executions
in the two sequences, we know that the prices can differ
by at most s2(Σ). If we have an execution only in one
sequence, we either match it in state ¯a¯b, or charge it by
(pmax + s2(Σ))/volume(Σ) if we end at state ¯a¯b.
If we end in state ab, ¯ab or a¯b, then every execution in
states ¯ab or a¯b were matched to an execution in state ¯a¯b. If
we end up in state ¯a¯b, we have the one execution that is not
matched and thus we charge it (pmax +s2(Σ))/volume(Σ).
We next give a stability result for the closing price. We
first provide a technical lemma regarding the prices of 
consecutive executions.
Lemma 5.9. Let Σ be any sequence. Then the prices of
two consecutive executions in Σ differ by at most s2(Σ).
Proof. Suppose the first execution is taken at time t;
its price is bounded below by the current bid and above by
the current ask. Now after this execution the bid is at least
the second highest buy order at time t, if the former bid
was executed and no higher buy orders arrived, and higher
otherwise. Similarly, the ask is at most the second lowest
sell order at time t. Therefore, the next execution price is
at least the second bid at time t and at most the second ask
at time t, which is at most s2(Σ) away from the bid/ask at
time t.
Lemma 5.10. Let Σ be any sequence and let Σ be a 
1modification of Σ. If the volume(Σ) ≥ 2, then
|close(Σ) − close(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ)
Proof. We first deal with case where the last execution
occurs in both sequences simultaneously. By Theorem 5.6,
both the ask and the bid of Σ and Σ are at most s2(Σ)
apart at every time t. Since the price of the last execution
is their asks (bids) at time t we are done.
Next we deal with the case where the last execution among
the two sequences occurs only in Σ. In this case we know
that either the previous execution happened simultaneously
in both sequences at time t, and thus all three executions are
within the second spread of Σ at time t (the first execution
in Σ by definition, the execution at Σ from identical 
arguments as in the former case, and the third by Lemma 5.9).
Otherwise the previous execution happened only in Σ at
time t, in which case the two executions are within the the
spread of Σ at time t (the execution of Σ from the same
arguments as before, and the execution in Σ must be inside
its spread in time t).
If the last execution happens only in Σ we know that
the next execution of Σ will be at most s2(Σ) away from
its previous execution by Lemma 5.9. Together with the
fact that if an execution happens only in one sequence it
implies that the order is in the spread of the second sequence
as long as the sequences are 1-modification, the proof is
completed.
5.2 Spread Bounds for k-Modifications
As in the case of executed volume, we would like to extend
the absolute model stability results for price-based 
quantities to the case where multiple orders are modified. Here our
results are weaker and depend on the k-spread, the distance
between the kth highest buy order and the kth lowest sell
order, instead of the second spread. (Looking ahead to 
Section 7, we note that in actual market data for liquid stocks,
this quantity is often very small as well.) We use sk(Σ) to
denote the k-spread. As before, we assume that the k-spread
is always defined after an initialization period.
We first state the following generalization of Lemma 5.7.
Lemma 5.11. Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any 
1modification of Σ. For ≥ 1, if s +1(Σ) is always defined
after the change, then s (Σ ) ≤ s +1(Σ).
The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 5.7 and 
omitted. A simple application of this lemma is the following: Let
Σ be any sequence which is an -modification of Σ. Then
we have s2(Σ ) ≤ s +2(Σ). Now using the above lemma and
by simple induction we can obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 5.12. Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any
k-modification of Σ. Then
1. |lastbid(Σ) − lastbid(Σ )| ≤
Pk
=1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ)
2. |lastask(Σ)−lastask(Σ )| ≤
Pk
=1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ)
3. |close(Σ) − close(Σ )| ≤
Pk
=1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ)
4. |average(Σ) − average(Σ )| ≤
Pk
=1

2(pmax +s +1(Σ))
volume(Σ)
+ s +1(Σ)

where s (Σ) is the maximum over the -spread in Σ following
the first modification.
We note that while these bounds depend on deeper 
measures of spread for more modifications, we are working in
a 1-share order model. Thus in an actual market, where
single orders contain hundreds or thousands of shares, the
k-spread even for large k might be quite small and close to
the standard 1-spread in liquid stocks.
