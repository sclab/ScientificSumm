In this paper, we first proposed a proxy-based 
architecture for MMOGs that enables MMOGs to scale to a large
number of users by mitigating the need for a large 
number of transport sessions to be maintained and decreasing
both bandwidth overhead and latency of event update. 
Second, we proposed a mixed authority assignment mechanism
that divides authority for making decisions on actions and
events within the game between the clients and server and
argued how such an authority assignment leads to better
game playing experience without sacrificing the consistency
of the game. Third, to validate the viability of the mixed
authority assignment mechanism, we implemented it within
a MMOG called RPGQuest and described our 
implementation experience.
In future work, we propose to implement the 
communications proxy architecture described in this paper and 
integrate the mixed authority mechanism within this 
architecture. We propose to evaluate the benefits of the proxy-based
architecture in terms of scalability, accuracy and 
responsiveness. We also plan to implement a version of the RPGQuest
game with dynamic assignment of authority to allow players
the authority to pickup objects when no other players are
near. As discussed earlier, this will allow for a more efficient
and responsive game in certain situations and alleviate some
of the processing load from the server.
Also, since so much trust is put into the clients of our 
architecture, it will be necessary to integrate into the 
architecture many of the cheat detection schemes that have been
proposed in the literature. Software such as Punkbuster [22]
and a reputation system like those proposed by [23] and [15]
would be integral to the operation of an architecture such as
ours which has a lot of trust placed on the client. We further
propose to make the proxies in our architecture more game
cognizant so that cheat detection mechanisms can be built
into the proxies themselves.
