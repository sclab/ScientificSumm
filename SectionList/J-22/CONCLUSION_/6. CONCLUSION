We consider a permutation betting scenario, where traders
wager on the final ordering of n candidates. While it is 
unnatural and intractable to allow traders to bet directly on
the n! different final orderings, we propose two expressive
betting languages, subset betting and pair betting. In a
subset betting market, traders can bet either on a subset of
positions that a candidate stands or on a subset of 
candidates who occupy a specific position in the final ordering.
Pair betting allows traders bet on whether one given 
candidate ranks higher than another given candidate.
We examine the auctioneer problem of matching orders
without incurring risk. We find that in a subset betting 
market an auctioneer can find the optimal set and quantity of
orders to accept such that his worst-case profit is maximized
in polynomial time if orders are divisible. The complexity
changes dramatically for pair betting. We prove that the
optimal matching problem for the auctioneer is NP-hard for
pair betting with both indivisible and divisible orders via
reductions to the minimum feedback arc set problem. We
identify a sufficient condition for the existence of a match,
which can be verified in polynomial time. A natural greedy
algorithm has been shown to give poor approximation for
indivisible pair betting.
Interesting open questions for our permutation betting 
include the computational complexity of optimal indivisible
matching for subset betting and the necessary condition for
the existence of a match in pair betting markets. We are
interested in further exploring better approximation 
algorithms for pair betting markets.
