The matching problems of the auctioneer in any 
permutation market, including the subset betting market have n!
constraints. Brute-force methods would take exponential
time to solve. However, given the special form of the 
securities in the subset betting market, we can show that the
matching problems for divisible orders can be solved in 
polynomial time.
Theorem 1. The existence of a match and the optimal
match problems with divisible orders in a subset betting 
market can both be solved in polynomial time.

Proof. Consider the linear programming problem (4) for
finding an optimal match. This linear program has |O| + 1
variables, one variable xi for each order i and the profit 
variable c. It also has exponentially many constraints. However,
we can solve the program in time polynomial in the 
number of orders |O| by using the ellipsoid algorithm, as long
as we can efficiently solve its corresponding separation 
problem in polynomial time [7, 8]. The separation problem for
a linear program takes as input a vector of variable values
and returns if the vector is feasible, or otherwise it returns
a violated constraint.
For given values of the variables, a violated constraint in
Eq. (4) asks whether there is a state or permutation s in
which the profit is less than c, and can be rewritten as
i
Ii(s)qixi <
i
biqixi − c ∀s ∈ S. (5)
Thus it suffices to show how to find efficiently a state s
satisfying the above inequality (5) or verify that the opposite
inequality holds for all states s.
We will show that the separation problem can be reduced
to the maximum weighted bipartite matching1
problem [3].
The left hand side in Eq. (5) is the total money that the
auctioneer needs to pay back to the winning traders in state
s. The first term on the right hand side is the total money
collected by the auctioneer and it is fixed for a given 
solution vector of xi"s and c. A weighted bipartite graph can
be constructed between the set of candidates and the set of
positions. For every order of the form α|Φ there are edges
from candidate node α to every position node in Φ. For 
orders of the form Ψ|j there are edges from each candidate in
Ψ to position j. For each order i we put weight qixi on each
of these edges. All multi-edges with the same end points
are then replaced with a single edge that carries the total
weight of the multi-edge. Every state s then corresponds
to a perfect matching in the bipartite graph. In addition,
the auctioneer pays out to the winners the sum of all edge
weights in the perfect matching since every candidate can
only stand in one position and every position is taken by
one candidate. Thus, the auctioneer"s worst-cast state and
payment are the solution to the maximum weighted 
bipartite matching problem, which has known polynomial-time
algorithms [12, 13]. Hence, the separation problem can be
solved in polynomial time.
Naturally, if the optimal solution to (4) gives a worst-case
profit of c∗
> 0, there exists a matching. Thus, the matching
problem can be solved in polynomial time also.
