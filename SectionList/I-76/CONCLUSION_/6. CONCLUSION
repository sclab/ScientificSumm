In this paper we proposed a logical framework for 
negotiating agents. To construct proposals in the process of 
negotiation, we combined the techniques of extended abduction
and relaxation. It was shown that these two operations are
used for general inference rules in producing proposals. We
developed a negotiation protocol between two agents based
on exchange of proposals and critiques, and provided 
procedures for computing proposals in abductive logic 
programming. This enables us to realize automated negotiation on
top of the existing answer set solvers. The present 
framework does not have a mechanism of selecting an optimal
(counter-)proposal among different alternatives. To 
compare and evaluate proposals, an agent must have preference
knowledge of candidate proposals. Further elaboration to
maximize the utility of agents is left for future study.
