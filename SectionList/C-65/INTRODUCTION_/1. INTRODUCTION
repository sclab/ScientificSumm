The importance of countersniper systems is underscored
by the constant stream of news reports coming from the
Middle East. In October 2006 CNN reported on a new 
tactic employed by insurgents. A mobile sniper team moves
around busy city streets in a car, positions itself at a good
standoff distance from dismounted US military personnel,
takes a single well-aimed shot and immediately melts in the
city traffic. By the time the soldiers can react, they are
gone. A countersniper system that provides almost 
immediate shooter location to every soldier in the vicinity would
provide clear benefits to the warfigthers.
Our team introduced PinPtr, the first sensor 
networkbased countersniper system [17, 8] in 2003. The system is
based on potentially hundreds of inexpensive sensor nodes
deployed in the area of interest forming an ad-hoc multihop
network. The acoustic sensors measure the Time of Arrival
(ToA) of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves, pressure
waves induced by the supersonic projectile, send the data to
a base station where a sensor fusion algorithm determines
the origin of the shot. PinPtr is characterized by high 
precision: 1m average 3D accuracy for shots originating within
or near the sensor network and 1 degree bearing precision
for both azimuth and elevation and 10% accuracy in range
estimation for longer range shots. The truly unique 
characteristic of the system is that it works in such reverberant
environments as cluttered urban terrain and that it can 
resolve multiple simultaneous shots at the same time. This
capability is due to the widely distributed sensing and the
unique sensor fusion approach [8]. The system has been
tested several times in US Army MOUT (Military 
Operations in Urban Terrain) facilities.
The obvious disadvantage of such a system is its static
nature. Once the sensors are distributed, they cover a 
certain area. Depending on the operation, the deployment may
be needed for an hour or a month, but eventually the area
looses its importance. It is not practical to gather and reuse
the sensors, especially under combat conditions. Even if the
sensors are cheap, it is still a waste and a logistical problem
to provide a continuous stream of sensors as the operations
move from place to place. As it is primarily the soldiers that
the system protects, a natural extension is to mount the
sensors on the soldiers themselves. While there are 
vehiclemounted countersniper systems [1] available commercially,
we are not aware of a deployed system that protects 
dismounted soldiers. A helmet-mounted system was developed
in the mid 90s by BBN [3], but it was not continued beyond
the Darpa program that funded it.

To move from a static sensor network-based solution to a
highly mobile one presents significant challenges. The sensor
positions and orientation need to be constantly monitored.
As soldiers may work in groups of as little as four people,
the number of sensors measuring the acoustic phenomena
may be an order of magnitude smaller than before. 
Moreover, the system should be useful to even a single soldier.
Finally, additional requirements called for caliber estimation
and weapon classification in addition to source localization.
The paper presents the design and evaluation of our 
soldierwearable mobile countersniper system. It describes the 
hardware and software architecture including the custom sensor
board equipped with a small microphone array and 
connected to a COTS MICAz mote [12]. Special emphasis is
paid to the sensor fusion technique that estimates the 
trajectory, range, caliber and weapon type simultaneously. The
results and analysis of an independent evaluation of the 
system at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center are also 
presented.
