Acoustic detection and recognition has been under 
research since the early fifties. The area has a close 
relevance to the topic of supersonic flow mechanics [20]. Fansler
analyzed the complex near-field pressure waves that occur
within a foot of the muzzle blast. Fansler"s work gives a
good idea of the ideal muzzle blast pressure wave without
contamination from echoes or propagation effects [4]. 
Experiments with greater distances from the muzzle were 
conducted by Stoughton [18]. The measurements of the ballistic
shockwaves using calibrated pressure transducers at known
locations, measured bullet speeds, and miss distances of 
355 meters for 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm projectiles were made.
Results indicate that ground interaction becomes a problem
for miss distances of 30 meters or larger.
Another area of research is the signal processing of gunfire
acoustics. The focus is on the robust detection and length
estimation of small caliber acoustic shockwaves and 
muzzle blasts. Possible techniques for classifying signals as 
either shockwaves or muzzle blasts includes short-time Fourier
Transform (STFT), the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville 
distribution (SPWVD), and a discrete wavelet transformation
(DWT). Joint time-frequency (JTF) spectrograms are used
to analyze the typical separation of the shockwave and 
muzzle blast transients in both time and frequency. Mays 
concludes that the DWT is the best method for classifying 
signals as either shockwaves or muzzle blasts because it works
well and is less expensive to compute than the SPWVD [10].
The edges of the shockwave are typically well defined and
the shockwave length is directly related to the bullet 
characteristics. A paper by Sadler [14] compares two shockwave
edge detection methods: a simple gradient-based detector,
and a multi-scale wavelet detector. It also demonstrates how
the length of the shockwave, as determined by the edge 
detectors, can be used along with Whithams equations [20] to
estimate the caliber of a projectile. Note that the available
computational performance on the sensor nodes, the limited
wireless bandwidth and real-time requirements render these
approaches infeasible on our platform.
A related topic is the research and development of 
experimental and prototype shooter location systems. Researchers
at BBN have developed the Bullet Ears system [3] which has
the capability to be installed in a fixed position or worn by
soldiers. The fixed system has tetrahedron shaped 
microphone arrays with 1.5 meter spacing. The overall system
consists of two to three of these arrays spaced 20 to 100
meters from each other. The soldier-worn system has 12
microphones as well as a GPS antenna and orientation 
sensors mounted on a helmet. There is a low speed RF 
connection from the helmet to the processing body. An extensive
test has been conducted to measure the performance of both
type of systems. The fixed systems performance was one 
order of magnitude better in the angle calculations while their
range performance where matched. The angle accuracy of
the fixed system was dominantly less than one degree while
it was around five degrees for the helmet mounted one. The
range accuracy was around 5 percent for both of the 
systems. The problem with this and similar centralized 
systems is the need of the one or handful of microphone arrays
to be in line-of-sight of the shooter. A sensor networked
based solution has the advantage of widely distributed 
sensing for better coverage, multipath effect compensation and
multiple simultaneous shot resolution [8]. This is especially
important for operation in acoustically reverberant urban
areas. Note that BBN"s current vehicle-mounted system
called BOOMERANG, a modified version of Bullet Ears,
is currently used in Iraq [1].
The company ShotSpotter specializes in law enforcement
systems that report the location of gunfire to police within
seconds. The goal of the system is significantly different
than that of military systems. Shotspotter reports 25 m
typical accuracy which is more than enough for police to
125
respond. They are also manufacturing experimental soldier
wearable and UAV mounted systems for military use [16],
but no specifications or evaluation results are publicly 
available.
