Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have
been shown to significantly improve the performance of text
retrieval algorithms on the web. The HITS algorithm is also
believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree,
one may expect HITS to be more informative that other
link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to
measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.
However, it remains unclear today whether there are 
practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures. This
is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval
algorithms used on the web use a document representation
which incorporates the document"s anchor text, i.e. the text
of incoming links. This, at least to some degree, takes the
link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.
Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is
no easy task. There are two main difficulties: scale and 
relevance. Scale is important because link-based features are
known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.
If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions won"t
carry over to large graphs such as the web. However, 
computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web
crawl is extraordinarily difficult. Relevance is also crucial
because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in
the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking
at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.
To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to 
evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based
features with respect to human evaluated judgment.
Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about
link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval
methods exploiting anchor text. This is reassuring: in the
absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these 
measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions
is to carry out realistic experiments. However, we were quite
surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is
about as effective as web page in-degree, the most 
simpleminded query-independent link-based feature. This 
continues to be true when the link-based features are combined
with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2 surveys related work. Section 3 describes the data
sets we used in our study. Section 4 reviews the 
performance measures we used. Sections 5 and 6 describe the
PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch
the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out
large scale experiments. Section 7 presents the results of our
evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks.
