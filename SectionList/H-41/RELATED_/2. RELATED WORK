The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search
results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS
[16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms. The popularity
of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the
Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned
a large amount of subsequent research.
There are numerous attempts at improving the 
effectiveness of HITS and PageRank. Query-dependent link-based
ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19],
Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.
Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired
by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and
TrustRank [11], and many others.
Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the
mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank. For 
example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical 
properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including
their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] 
studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph
and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and
Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as 
existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of
power iteration [18].
Given the attention that has been paid to improving the
effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough 
studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is
somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their 
effectiveness have been published. We are aware of two studies
that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of
HITS and of PageRank. Amento et al. [1] employed 
quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result
sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical
crawls around the result set of each query. A more recent
study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets
of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a 
neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result
from Google. By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000
queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs.
