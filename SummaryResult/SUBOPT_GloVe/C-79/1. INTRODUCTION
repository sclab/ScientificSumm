However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive  routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.
One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P)  system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.
This paper describes a design paradigm that uses the following two functional primitives to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs.
Query packets are used to
