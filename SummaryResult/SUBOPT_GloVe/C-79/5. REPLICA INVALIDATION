Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a  resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and  invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.
The structure (topology) of the validation mesh keeps evolving (1) when nodes request and cache a resource, (2) when nodes update their  respective replicas and invalidate other replicas, and (3) when nodes move.
