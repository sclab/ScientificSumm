From Figure 8, we know the delay increases as the speed increases, which is due to the fact that with increasing speed,  clients will move out of mesh with higher probability.
In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.
Delay decreases slightly as the number of nodes increases , due to the fact that the more nodes in the network , the more nodes receives the advertisement packets which helps the search packet
