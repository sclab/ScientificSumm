4.1 Resource Replication Multiple replicas of a resource in the network help prevent a  single node, as well as nodes surrounding it, from being overloaded by a large number of requests and data transfers.
Furthermore, in MANETs, we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider, but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the provider and other nodes as well.
In certain situations , it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the resource can be relocated and/or replicated ,
