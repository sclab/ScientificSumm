In this work, we show how the model can be extended and used for query  expansion using a technique that we call latent concept expansion (LCE).
Therefore, by performing query expansion using the MRF model, we are able to study the dynamics between term dependence and query expansion.
For this reason, there has been a strong interest in query expansion techniques.
Query expansion techniques have been well studied for various models in the past and have shown to significantly improve effectiveness in both the relevance feedback and pseudo-relevance feedback setting [12, 21, 28, 29].
