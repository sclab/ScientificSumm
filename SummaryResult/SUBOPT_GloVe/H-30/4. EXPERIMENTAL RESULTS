However, since our model is based on a number of different features over various types of cliques, it is more general and robust than a bigram model.
Here, we define robustness as the number queries whose effectiveness are improved/hurt (and by how much) as the result of  applying these methods.
On the query side, this is typically done using some form of query expansion, such as relevance models or LCE.
Although we only provided the concepts generated for a single query , we note that the same analysis and conclusions generalize across other data sets , with coherent , topically
