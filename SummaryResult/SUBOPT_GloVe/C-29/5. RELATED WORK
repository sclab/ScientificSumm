Recently, an algorithm has been developed that solves the problems of parallelization and communication in poorly connected processors to be used for simulation.
However, the skills and effort required to develop a grid application may not be required for OmniRPC.
Nimrod has been applied to  applications including bio-informatics, operations research, and molecular modeling for drug design.
Ninf-G[7] is a grid-enabled implementation of Ninf and provides a GridRPC[10] system that uses LDAP to manage the database of remote  executables, but does not support clusters involving private IP  addresses or addresses inside a firewall.
Nimrod incorporates a distributed scheduling component
