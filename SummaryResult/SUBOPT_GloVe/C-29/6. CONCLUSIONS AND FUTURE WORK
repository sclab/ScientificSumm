This can eliminate  unnecessary communication and the initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G. CONFLEX-G can achieves performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and exploits more computing resources by allowing the use of multiple PC clusters in the grid.
Deployment tools will be required as the number of remote hosts is increased.
In order to explore the conformation of large bio-molecules,  CONFLEXG was used to generate trial structures of the molecules, and allocate jobs to optimize them by molecular mechanics in the grid.
In the current OmniRPC , the registration of an execution program to remote hosts and deployments of worker programs
