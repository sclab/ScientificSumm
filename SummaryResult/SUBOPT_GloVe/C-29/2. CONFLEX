When all of the trial structures related to a given initial structure are optimized, only the master  procedure is used in comparison.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which  determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is pre-defined.
Therefore, these tactical procedures of the CONFLEX search are referred to as the Reservoir Filling Algorithm.
The initial structure is selected as the set of lowest energy conformers stored in the conformation database.
By parallelizing CONFLEX, the speedup of searching molecular conformers obtained is as reported in[11].
