â€¢ In this experiment, we used a simple build-in  roundrobbin scheduler of OmniRPC, which is necessary in order to apply the scheduler that allocates structures with long optimization times to a high-performance Table 8: Statistics of elapsed time of trial structure optimization using 28 workers in the Dennis cluster.
In the case of Toyo cluster, where the network performance between the client program and the worker programs is poor, the time of data transmission to the worker program required approximately 6.7 seconds.
The result of this experiment shows that CONFLEX-G can reduce the execution time as the number of workers
