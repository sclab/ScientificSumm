This can eliminate unnecessary communication and initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G.  CONFLEXG can achieve performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and can exploit more computing resources by allowing the use of a cluster of multiple clusters in the grid.
In this paper, we report the performance of CONFLEX-G in a grid testbed of several geographically distributed PC clusters.
In order to explore many  conformation of large bio-molecules, CONFLEX-G generates trial structures of the molecules and allocates jobs to  optimize a trial structure with a reliable molecular mechanics method in the grid.
The load imbalance of the optimization time of the
