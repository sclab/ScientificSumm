It is hoped that such a model will allow the  computation of human interest in the sentence with respect to the topic.

Current approaches to identifying definitional sentences in the  context of Question Answering mainly involve the use of linguistic or syntactic patterns to identify informative nuggets.
This paper proposes to address the deficiency by building a Human Interest Model from external knowledge.
This is insufficient as they do not address the novelty factor that a
