change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2,  every agent will switch to strategy A, and hence A becomes an  epidemic.4 4 Strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as a single infinite sequence of vertices in V (G) \ T, the order 1, −1, 2, −2, .
However , since vertices of G have finite degree , it is not hard to see that any ordering of a multiset containing any ( possibly infinite ) 78 1/20 r q 0 1/4 3/16 1/12 1/4 Figure 3 : Epidemic regions for the infinite grid 1/20 1/Δ r q 0 1/Δ
