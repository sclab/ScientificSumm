We find that for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of q and r, to one where x = 0.
Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.
As this unfolds , there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching
