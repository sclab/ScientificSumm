Finally, we  consider a compatibility parameter qBC that represents the payoffs to two adjacent nodes when one selects B and the other selects C. Thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ).
Surprisingly, however, there are also instances in which compatibility is in fact harmful to both parties; the next example considers a fixed initial configuration with technologies A, B and C that is at  equilibrium when qBC = 0.
We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ , there is a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the
