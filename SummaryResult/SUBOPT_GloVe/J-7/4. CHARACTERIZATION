Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with  technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any  sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and the vertices in SB have strategy B.
Let SAB be the set of vertices with  strategy AB and SB be the set of vertices with strategy B in this outcome.
The inequalities for the vertices v âˆˆ SB can be derived in a similar manner.
