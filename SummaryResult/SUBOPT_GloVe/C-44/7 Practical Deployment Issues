This solution is based on the fact that nodes have a high probability of flipping in the sequence if they are near to each other along the event propagation direction.
In the left side of Figure 13(a), suppose node 1 and node 2 are so close to each other that it takes less than 0.5ms for the localization event to propagate from node 1 to node 2.
So node 1 is expected to be located to the right of node 2, such as at the position of the dashed node 1.
Secondly , since in advanced MSP each node
