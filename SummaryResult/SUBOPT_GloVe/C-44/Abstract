To overcome limitations in  existing solutions, we present a Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments.
Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and  effective range of sensor devices.
Starting from a basic MSP design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy.
The novel idea behind MSP is to  reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences, easily obtained through loosely guided event  distribution.
