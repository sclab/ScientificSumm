However, the node sequences obtained from two scans indicate that node 1 should be to the left of and above node 2, as shown in Figure 6(b).
We noted that in basic MSP, only the anchors are used to narrow down the polygon of each target node, but actually there is more information in the node sequence that we can made use of.
Iterative MSP: Reprocessing Scan 1 From above, we can see that the sequence-based MSP makes use of the information embedded in every sequential node pair in the node sequence.
Thus , we can further narrow the
