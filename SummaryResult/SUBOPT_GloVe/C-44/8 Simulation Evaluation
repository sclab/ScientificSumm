Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we  compare regular scan with random scan under a different number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.
Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we compare regular scan with random scan under different  number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.
For example, when the number of scans is 30, errors in sequence-based MSP are about 20% of that of basic MSP.
However, the performance gap reduces as the number of scans increases.
This phenomenon has an interesting explanation : the cutting
