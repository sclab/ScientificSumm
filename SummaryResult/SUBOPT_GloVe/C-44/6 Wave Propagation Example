Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.
Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave  propagation scenario.
Each node is  located in one of the small areas.
In Figure 11 , if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line , which perpendicularly bisects the
