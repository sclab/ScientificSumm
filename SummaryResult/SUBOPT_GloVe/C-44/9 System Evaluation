Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.
Figure 23(a) shows that a  protection band of 0.35 feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 8.57feet/s.
Interesting phenomena can be  observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.
In the  system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node.
In general , with increasing scanning speed ,
