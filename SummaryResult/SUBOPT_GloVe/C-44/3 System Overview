For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: â€¢ Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9].
Each node sequence includes both the targets and the anchors as shown in Figure 1(b).
Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).
Target nodes are defined as the nodes to be localized.
As each event propagates , as shown in Figure 1 ( a ) , each node
