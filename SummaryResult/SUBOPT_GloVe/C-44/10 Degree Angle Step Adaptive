The two curves present the performance of  iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to sequence-based MSP.
Clearly the mean error in  basic MSP is not affected by the number of target nodes, as shown in Figure 15(c).
Impact of Area Shape: First, if system settings are regular, the adaptive method hardly contributes to the results.
For example, adaptive MSP improves  localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10.
This phenomenon makes statistical sense , because the law of large numbers
