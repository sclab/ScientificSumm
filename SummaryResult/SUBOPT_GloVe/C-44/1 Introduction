To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in  deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors.
It works using sensors typically used by sensor  network applications, such as light and acoustic sensors, both of which we specifically consider in this work.
â€¢ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive events.
Realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the large-scale outdoor environment , researchers have recently proposed solutions (
