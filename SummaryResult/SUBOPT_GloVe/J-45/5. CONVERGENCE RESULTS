Similarly, we define n(r) to be (r) with respect to the game Γn.
Then ˆθ is a consistent estimator of θ∗ if W (N(θ), θ) is defined as a supremum, infimum, or  expectation over the set of Nash equilibria.
Now, let Nn denote all Nash equilibria of the game Γn and let Nδ = [ x∈N BS(x, δ), that is, the union of open balls of radius δ with centers at Nash equilibria of Γ.
In this section , we show that n ( s ) → ( s ) a.s. uniformly on the mixed strategy space for any
