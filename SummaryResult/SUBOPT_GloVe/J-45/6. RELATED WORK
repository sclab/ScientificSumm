Additionally, there is an extensive  literature on optimal auction design [10], of which the work by Roger Myerson [11] is, perhaps, the most relevant.
One approach in that direction, taken in [4] and [15], is to co-evolve the mechanism parameter and agent strategies,  using some notion of social utility and agent payoffs as fitness  criteria.
When payoff functions of players are unknown, a search using simulations has been explored as an alternative.
[14] compared two mechanisms based on expected social utility with expectation taken over an empirical distribution of equilibria in games defined by heuristic strategies, as in [18].
