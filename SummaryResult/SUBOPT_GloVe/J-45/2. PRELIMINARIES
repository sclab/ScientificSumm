We designate the set of pure strategies available to player i by Ai, and denote the joint set of pure strategies of all players by A = A1 Ã—.
We can extend this definition to mixed strategies by assuming that ui are von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utilities as follows: ui(s) = Es[ui], where Es is the expectation taken with respect to the probability distribution of play induced by the players" mixed strategy s. 2 By employing the normal form, we model agents as playing a  single action, with decisions taken simultaneously.
Ri is the set of strategies available to player
