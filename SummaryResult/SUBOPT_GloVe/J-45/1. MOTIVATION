Under the assumption that the simulator itself is the only reliable source of outcome  computation, we refer to our task as empirical mechanism design.
Finally, we conclude from our data that it is very unlikely that any reasonable setting of storage costs would  result in acceptable levels of day-0 procurement, so a different design approach would have been required to eliminate this problem.
As it happened, the specified negotiation behavior of suppliers provided a great incentive for agents to procure large quantities of components on day 0: the very beginning of the simulation.
In response to the problem , the
