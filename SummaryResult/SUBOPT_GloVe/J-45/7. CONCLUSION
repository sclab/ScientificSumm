The success of our analysis in this extremely complex environment with high  simulation costs makes us optimistic that our methods can provide  guidance in making mechanism design decisions in other challenging domains.
In applying empirical game analysis to the problem at hand, we are fully aware that our results are inherently inexact.
A difficult design issue in the TAC/SCM game which the TAC community has been eager to address provides us with a setting to test our methods.
Thus, we concentrate on collecting evidence about the structure of the Nash equilibrium correspondence.
The theoretical results confirm some intuitions behind the
