We discussed that the absence of those parameters is compensated by a leverage effect of the within-document term occurrence probability and the document containment probability.
The explicit and mathematical formulation of idf - and Poisson-assumptions is the main result of this paper.
We showed that the classical definition of the noise (document frequency) in the inverse document frequency can be explained by three assumptions: the term within-document occurrence  probability is binary, the document containment probability is constant, and the document containment events are disjoint.
The definition of the probability of being informative transforms the informative interpretation of the idf into a
