We consider a document as a subset of T and a term as a subset of D. Let nT ( d ) : = | { t|d ∈ t } | be the number of terms that occur in the document d , and let nD ( t ) : = | { d|t ∈ d } | be the number of documents that contain the term t. In a dual way , we associate a document space L × T with a document d where L is the set of locations ( also referred to as positions , however
