The setting λ = ln N is special in the sense that the frequency-based and the Poisson-based informativeness have the same denominator, namely ln N, and the Poisson sum converges to λ.
= eλ − 1 For λ >> 1, we can alter the noise and informativeness  Poisson by starting the sum from 0, since eλ >> 1.
λ The computation of the Poisson sum requires an  optimisation for large n(t).
The probability functions  displayed are summarised in figure 2 where the simplified  Poisson is used in the noise and informativeness graphs.
For an illustration , consider the distance between the value idf
