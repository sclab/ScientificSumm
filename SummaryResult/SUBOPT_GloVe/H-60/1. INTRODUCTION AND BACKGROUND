With N being the total number of  documents, and n(t) being the number of documents in which term t occurs, the idf is defined as follows: idf(t) := − log n(t) N , 0 <= idf(t) < ∞ Ranking based on the sum of the idf -values of the query terms that occur in the retrieved documents works well, this has been shown in numerous applications.
Can we interpret Pfreq , the normalised idf , as the probability that the term is informative?
We associate noise with the document frequency of a term in a collection , and we associate occurrence with
