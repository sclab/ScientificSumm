Using this method practically guarantees reusability: with as few as five judgments per topic taken from only two systems, we can reliably  evaluate a larger set of ten systems.
In this work, we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments.
Even the smallest sets of judgments can be useful for evaluation of new systems.
While these judgments are very useful for a one-time evaluation , it is not clear that they can be trusted when re-used to evaluate
