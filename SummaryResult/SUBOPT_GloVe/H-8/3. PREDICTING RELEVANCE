Specifically, we want to learn a calibration function qij = Cj(qâˆ— ij) that will ensure that the predicted probabilities are tuned to the expert"s ability to retrieve relevant documents given the judgments that have been made to this point.
This is  semisupervised; we have relevance judgments at some ranks which we use to impute the probability of relevance at other ranks.
Using these as prior parameters ensures that the resulting probabilities will be concentrated around the ratio of relevant documents that have been discovered for topic t. This means that the probability estimates decrease by rank and are
