Furthermore, we could assume that the relevance of  documents i and j is independent and achieve the same result, which we state as a corollary: Corollary 1.
where xm is the set of relevance judgments defined above, Xn is the full set of documents that we wish to estimate the relevance of, and I is some information about the documents (unspecified as of now).
By that we mean that if we have made some relevance judgments and have , for example , 75 % confidence that system A is better than system B , we would like there to be
