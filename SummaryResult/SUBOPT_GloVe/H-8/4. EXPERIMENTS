The first, and most important, is that using our expert aggregation model to predict relevance produces test collections that are robust enough to be reusable; that is, we can trust the estimates of confidence when we evaluate systems that did not contribute any judgments to the pool.
Finally, for our hypothesis that RTC is more accurate than MTC, we will look at Kendall"s τ correlation between a ranking of k systems by a small set of judgments and the true ranking using the full set of judgments.
To put our method to the test , we selected c
