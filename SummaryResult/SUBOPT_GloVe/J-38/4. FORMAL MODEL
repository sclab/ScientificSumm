We can simply take the set of attributes as equal to the set of agents, i.e., M = N, an identity matrix for A, aggregators of sums, and the  aggregate value function w to be v. 172 4.2 An Example Let us illustrate how MACG can be used to represent a game with a simple example.
Note that when all aggregators are simple, the aggregate value function implicitly defines a game over the attributes, as it assigns a value to each set of attributes T âŠ† M. We refer to this as the game among attributes.
An aggregating function ( or
