Without loss of generality, since the bound is  multiplicative, we can normalize the game to having v(N) = 1.
For a coalition S, the first aggregator evaluates to 1 if agent 1 âˆˆ S, and the second aggregator evaluates to 1 if both agents are in S. While agent 2 is not a dummy with respect to the second attribute, it is a dummy with respect to the product of the attributes.
Agent 2 will be assigned a value of 1 4 by the estimate.
