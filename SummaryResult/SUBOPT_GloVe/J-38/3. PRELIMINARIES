In a simple game, a coalition either wins, in which case it has a value of 1, or loses, in which case it has a value of 0.
An outcome x ∈ R|N| is in the core of the game N, v if for all S ⊆ N, i∈S xi ≥ v(S) Note that the core of a game may be empty, i.e., there may not exist any payoff vector that satisfies the stability  requirement for the given game.
( Shapley Value ) Given a description of the coalitional game and an agent i , compute the Shapley value
