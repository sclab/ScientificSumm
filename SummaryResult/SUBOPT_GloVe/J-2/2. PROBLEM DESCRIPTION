We do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi; because of this, ai"s  incentives are unaffected by this redistribution payment, and the mechanism remains strategy-proof. 
After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribution payment.
Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.
We also assume that m and n are always known.
, an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
( This assumption is not harmful : in environments where anyone
