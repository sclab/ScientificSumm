Finally, we compare the worst-case optimal mechanism to the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, n = m + 2, .
We see that for any m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (actually, in this case, the worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the  BaileyCavallo mechanism).
The theory of order statistics tells us that the 34 joint probability density function of ˆv2 and ˆv3 is f(ˆv3, ˆv2) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)ˆvn−3 3 (1 − ˆv2) for ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3.
For n = 20 ,
