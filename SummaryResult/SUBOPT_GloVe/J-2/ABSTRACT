In 2006,  Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property.
Here we propose a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents.
We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and show how to cast this model as a linear program.
For allocation problems with one or more items , the wellknown Vickrey-Clarke-Groves ( VCG ) mechanism is efficient , strategy-proof
