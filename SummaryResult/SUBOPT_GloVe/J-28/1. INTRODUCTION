For instance, the classic 0/1 knapsack is a special case of this problem.1 We model the 1 However, the problem can be solved easily by a greedy scheme if we remove all capacity constraints from the seller and all 166 allocation problem as a novel and interesting generalization of the classic knapsack problem, and develop a fully  polynomialtime approximation scheme, computing a (1 + )-approximation in worst-case time T = O(n3 /Îµ), where each bid has a fixed number of piecewise constant pieces.
This is an example of the budget-deficit problem that often occurs in efficient mechanism design [17].
