In addition, the VCG mechanism is allocatively-efficient, and the payments from each buyer are always positive.3 Moreover, each buyer pays less than its value, and receives payoff V (I)âˆ’V (I \ i) in equilibrium; this is precisely the marginal-value that buyer i contributes to the economic efficiency of the system.
