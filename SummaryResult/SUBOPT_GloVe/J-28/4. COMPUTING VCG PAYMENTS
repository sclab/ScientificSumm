In this section, we show that our approximation scheme for the  generalized knapsack can be extended to determine all n payments in total time O(αT log(αn/ε)), where 1 ≤ C(I\i)/C(I) ≤ α, for a constant upper bound, α, and T is the complexity of  solving the allocation problem once.
This will be a component in computing an approximation to C(I \ i), the value of the solution to the generalized knapsack without bids from agent i.
For a given g , the only element which we need to consider in g '' s feasible set
