Suppose G[i, r] denotes the maximum number of units that can be obtained at cost at most r using only the first i lists in the generalized knapsack.
We say that the size of an anchor tj i is uj i , 8 In fact, because of the one per list constraint, the generalized problem is closer in spirit to the multiple choice knapsack  problem [9], where the underling set of items is partitioned into  disjoint subsets U1, U2, .
It is worth noting , that unlike the 2-approximation scheme for iKnapsack ( , j ) , the value computed with
