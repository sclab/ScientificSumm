Both the algorithms are based on delaying (or dropping) the sending of DR vectors to some players on a continuous basis to try and make the export error the same at all the players.
The error due to this deviation can be removed if each movement of player/entity is communicated to the other players at every time unit; that is a DR vector is generated at every time unit thereby making the real and exported paths the same.
In an earlier paper [ 1 ] , we showed that by synchronizing the clocks at all the players and by using
