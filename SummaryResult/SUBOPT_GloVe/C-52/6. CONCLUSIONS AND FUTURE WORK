To counter this effect, we presented budget based algorithms where the DR vectors are still  scheduled to be sent at different players at different times but the  algorithm balances the need for fairness with the requirement that the error of the worst case players (who are furthest from the sender) are not increased compared to the base case (where all DR vectors are sent to all players every time a DR vector is generated).
We then presented an algorithm based on scheduling the DR vectors to be sent to different players at different times thereby equalizing the error at different
