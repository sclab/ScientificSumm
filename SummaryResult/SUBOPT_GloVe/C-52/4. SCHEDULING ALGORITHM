The receiver can  compute this information as it knows the time at which DR1 was sent (T1 1 = T1 + Î´1, which is appended to the DR vector as shown in Figure 2) and the local receiving time (which is synchronized with the sender"s clock).
4.6 Handling Cases in Practice So far we implicity assumed that DRi is sent out to all receivers before a decision is made to compute the next DR vector DRi+1 , and the receivers send the value of dak corresponding to DRi and this information reaches the sender before it computes DRi+1 so that
