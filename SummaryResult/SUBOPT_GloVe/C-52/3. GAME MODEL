The receiving player computes the starting position for the entity based on xi, yi and the time difference  between when the DR vector is received and the time Ti at which it was computed.
Thus , the DR vectors sent by a player specifies the current time at the player when the DR vector is computed ( not the time at which this DR vector is sent to the other players as we will explain later ) , the current position of the player/entity in terms of the x , y , z coordinates and the velocity vector in the
