An additional property of the proposed  algorithms is that they require less number of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.
This algorithm makes the game very fair at the expense of  increasing the overall mean error of all players.
In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors to exchange movement information among players, there is  inaccuracy in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between the sender and the receiver.
To mitigate this effect , we propose a budget based algorithm
