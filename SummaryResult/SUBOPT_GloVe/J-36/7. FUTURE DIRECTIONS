It is also interesting to consider settings in which the game"s queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions.
When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions.
In a correlated  equilibrium, a player"s expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in Stage 1 so as to land in a Stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response.
Conversely , it is NP-hard to compute a
