For Step 2, we have described how to compute the relevant response functions by examining every action of Player I, every world, every query, and every action of Player II.
More specifically, given fii and the result qi(wreal) of the query qi, it is straightforward to compute the  probability that, conditioned on the fact that the result of query qi is qi(w), the world is w and Player II will play action aii âˆˆ Aii.
Any feasible point for the LP in Figure 1 can be efficiently mapped to a Nash equilibrium for G , and any Nash
