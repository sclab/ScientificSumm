Define an unobservable-query  Socratic game G∗ with one possible world for each t ∈ T, one available zero-cost query qi for each Player i so that qi  reveals ti, and all else as in G. Bayesian Nash equilibria in G correspond directly to Nash equilibria in G∗ , and the worlds of G∗ are strategically zero sum.
By Lemma 5.5, we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic game for which Nash  equilibria are computable in the induced Gstage2(q) games (e.g., when Gstage2(q) is of constant size).
Let alg be an arbitrary algorithm that finds a Bayesian
