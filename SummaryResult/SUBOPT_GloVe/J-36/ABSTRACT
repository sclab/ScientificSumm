The results in this paper consider cases in which the  underlying worlds of a two-player Socratic game are either constant-sum games or strategically zero-sum games, a class that generalizes constant-sum games to include all games in which the sum of payoffs depends linearly on the interaction between the players.
We imagine a player engaged in a  questionand-answer session, asking questions both about his or her own preferences and about the state of reality; thus we call this setting Socratic game theory.
When the underlying worlds are constant sum , we give polynomial-time algorithms to find Nash equilibria in both the
