It is assumed that any allocation is a disjoint union of procurement sets and therefore one can say that an  allocation partitions the players into two sets; a set of players that trade and a set of players that do not trade.
It is important to note that since replacement sets are transitive relations and since class domains also impose symmetric  relations on the replacement sets, the class of a player i, [i] is actually an equivalence class for i.
The sets of trade are called procurement sets and are defined (following [2]) as follows: Definition 2.1.
We define the
