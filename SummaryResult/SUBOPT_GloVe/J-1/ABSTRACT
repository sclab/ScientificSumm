In this paper we provide a procedure called a  Generalized Trade Reduction (GTR) for single-value players, which given an IR and IC mechanism, outputs a mechanism which is IR, IC and BB with a loss of welfare.
Furthermore, our solution provides  budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed  markets with strategic transportation edges.
There have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by  trading welfare for BB, e.g., in domains such as double-sided auctions[13], distributed markets[3] and supply chain  problems[2, 4].
It is well known [ 15 ] that it is
