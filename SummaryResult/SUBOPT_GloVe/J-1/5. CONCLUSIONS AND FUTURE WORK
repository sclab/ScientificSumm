Although we know that it is impossible to have IR, IC and BB in an efficient mechanism it would be interesting to have an upper bound on the approximation to welfare achievable in an IR, IC and BB mechanism.
The output  mechanisms achieves welfare that is close to optimal for a wide range of domains.
The question of the quality of welfare approximation both in general and in class domains that are not procurement class domains is an important and interesting open  question.
We also leave open the question of upper bounds for the quality of approximation of welfare.
