The search can be realized via a negotiation mechanism (or algorithm) by which the agents follow a high level protocol prescribing the rules of interactions, using a set of strategies devised to select their own preferences at each negotiation step.
Therefore, in  cooperatively searching for a DCSP solution, the agents would need to communicate with one another, and adjust and re-adjust their own variable assignments in the process.
To  distinguish it from the priority of an agent, the priority of a constraint is called its weight. 
If the agents succeed in their resolution, a solution is found.
As a result
