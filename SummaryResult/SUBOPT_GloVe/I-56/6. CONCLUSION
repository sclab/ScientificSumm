The idea of DCSP agents using different strategies in the same environment will also be investigated. 
Our work shows that several  wellknown DCSP algorithms, namely ABT, AWC and DBO, can be described as mechanisms sharing the same proposed protocol, and only differ in the strategies employed for the reasoning steps per negotiation round as governed by the protocol.
Future work will attempt to formally  establish this property, as well as formalize other existing DSCP algorithms as BDI negotiation mechanisms, including the recent endeavor that employs a group mediator [5].
Importantly , this means that it might furnish a unified framework
