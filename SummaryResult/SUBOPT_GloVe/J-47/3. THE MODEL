⊕ (Sk : pk).14 3.3 Iterative Auctions The auctioneer sets up a protocol (equivalently an  algorithm), where at each stage of the protocol some  information q - termed the query - is sent to some bidder i, and then bidder i replies with some reply that depends on the query as well as on his own valuation.
Thus, in some parts of the paper we assume without loss of generality that δ = 1, hence all valuations are integral.
This is because that ascending auctions can usually not achieve such running times ( consider even the English auction on a single item )
