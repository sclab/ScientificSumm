For our purposes, two families of these auctions serve as the main motivating starting points: the first is the  ascending item-price auctions of [22, 17] that with computational efficiency find an optimal allocation among (gross)  substitutes valuations, and the second is the ascending  bundleprice auctions of [37, 3] that find an optimal allocation among general valuations - but not necessarily with  computational efficiency.
These results are part of a recent line of research ( [ 7 , 43 , 24 , 40 ] ) that study the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and its relation to the full elicitation problem
