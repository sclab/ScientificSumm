A value query can be simulated by mt  demand queries (where t = log L is the number of bits needed to represent a single bundle value).18 As a direct corollary we get that demand auctions can always fully elicit the bidders" valuations by simulating all possible 2m âˆ’ 1 queries and thus elicit enough information for determining the optimal allocation.
First we note that value queries are not completely powerless : In [ 19 ] it is shown that if the m items are split into k fixed bundles of size m/k each , and these fixed bundles
