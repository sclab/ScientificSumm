The power of multiple-trajectory auctions can be  demonstrated by the negative result of Gul and Stacchetti [17] who showed that even for an auction among substitutes  valuations, an anonymous ascending item-price auction cannot compute VCG prices for all players.21 Ausubel [4] overcame this impossibility result and designed auctions that do  compute VCG prices by organizing the auction as a sequence of n + 1 ascending auctions.
The tatonnement algorithms by [ 22 , 12 , 16 ] end up with the optimal allocation for substitutes valuations.25 We prove that we can not fully elicit substitutes valuations ( or even their
