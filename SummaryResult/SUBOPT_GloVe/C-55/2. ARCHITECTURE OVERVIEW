Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.
Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.
The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the user '' s locations , which is implemented in the
