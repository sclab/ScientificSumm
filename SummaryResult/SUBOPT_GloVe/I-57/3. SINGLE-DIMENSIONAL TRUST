The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.
Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.
3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from
