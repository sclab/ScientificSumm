They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.
They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always  truthfully report their trust estimates.
By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more  principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.
The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of
