Note that this goal cannot be implemented in dominant strategies  without payments (similar to Claim 1, when the type of each agent here is the set of files he holds).
245 The network mechanism utilizes the chain mechanism in the following way: When agent B requests a file from agent A (at most r âˆ’ 1 far), then A sends to B the list of his neighbors and the output of the ping protocol to all of these neighbors.
