Even if the information is recorded with some probability, this enables us to implement a wider range of social goals,  using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
This suggests that the standard requirements must be relaxed in order to construct general-purpose mechanisms.
We observe that in many common distributed  environments computational entities can take advantage of the  network structure to collect and distribute information.
As a case study, we apply our methods to derive Peer-to-Peer network mechanism for file sharing.
As it turns out , many natural social goals can not be implemented using the dominant strategy
