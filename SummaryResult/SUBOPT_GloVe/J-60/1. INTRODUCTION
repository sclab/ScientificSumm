As a result, it is straightforward for a player to compute his strategy.1 Second, sequential mechanisms avoid  simultaneous moves, and thus can be considered for distributed networks.
And so it is seems natural to consider environments in which the  information is locally recorded, that is, the information is recorded in the closest neighborhood with some probability p. In this paper we shall see that if the information is  available with some probability, then this enables us to  implement a wider range of social goals.
1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for
