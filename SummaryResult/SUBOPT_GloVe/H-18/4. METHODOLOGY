In the case of topic segmentation, the two random  variables are the term variable T and the segment variable S, and each sample is an occurrence of a term T = t in a particular segment S = s. I(T; S) is used to measure how dependent T and S are.
For the initial alignment Ali(0) , we can first assume that the order of segments for each d is the same.
The two steps are : ( 1 ) based on current term clustering CluË†t , for each document d , the algorithm segments all the sentences Sd into p
