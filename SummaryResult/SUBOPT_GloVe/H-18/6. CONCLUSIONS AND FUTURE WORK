More previous methods should be compared with.
Our results also illustrated that  using weighted mutual information can utilize the information of multiple documents to reach a better performance.
Moreover, we also showed that doing  segmentation among multiple documents can improve the  performance tremendously.
We proposed a novel method for multi-document topic segmentation and alignment based on weighted mutual  information, which can also handle single-document cases.
Moreover,  natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be used to find the optimal boundaries.
We only tested our method on limited data sets.
Our approach outperforms all the previous methods on singledocument cases
