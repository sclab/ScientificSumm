Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 
Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].
Criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the  issue of topic segmentation.
Topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area , especially co-clustering of documents and terms , such as LSA [ 9 ] , PLSA [ 13 ] ,
