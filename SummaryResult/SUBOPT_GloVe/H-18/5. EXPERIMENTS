Table 6 illustrates the experiment results for the case of 20 partitions (each has five document samples) of the training set and topic segmentation and alignment using MIk with different numbers of term clusters k. Notice that when the number of term clusters increases, the error rate becomes smaller.
If most documents have different topics, in WMIl, the estimation of term weights in Equation (3) is not correct.
Generally, we can only expect a better performance when the number of documents is larger than the number of  segments.
First , because samples vote for the best multi-document segmentation and alignment
