However, similarly to [6], they fail to address the lack of global state knowledge, which is a fundamental issue in decentralized planning.
Our heuristic solution method, called Value Function Propagation (VFP), provided two  orthogonal improvements of OC-DEC-MDP: (i) It speeded up  OC-DECMDP by an order of magnitude by maintaining and manipulating a value function for each method rather than a separate value for each pair of method and time interval, and (ii) it achieved better solution qualities than OC-DEC-MDP because it corrected the  overestimation of the opportunity cost of OC-DEC-MDP.
In this paper , we improved a state-of-the-art heuristic solution
