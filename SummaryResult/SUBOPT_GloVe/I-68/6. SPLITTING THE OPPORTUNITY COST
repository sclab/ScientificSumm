So far, we have taken the same  approach as in [4] and [5] in that the opportunity cost function Vj0,ik that the method mik sends back to the method mj0 is a  minimal, non-increasing function that dominates function V j0,ik (t) = (Vj0 · Q k ∈{0,...,K} k =k Pik )(t).
However, heuristic H 1,0 leaves K − 1 methods that  precede the method mj0 without any reward which leads to starvation.
Finally , if Vj0 is split in a way , that for some k , Vj0 , ik = 0 , it is the
