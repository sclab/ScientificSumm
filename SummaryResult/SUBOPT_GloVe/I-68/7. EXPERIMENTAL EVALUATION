We decided to test the runtime of the VFP algorithm running with three different levels of accuracy, i.e., different approximation  parameters P and V were chosen, such that the cumulative error of the solution found by VFP stayed within 1%, 5% and 10% of the solution found by the OC- DEC-MDP algorithm.
Since the VFP algorithm that we introduced provides two orthogonal improvements over the OC-DEC-MDP algorithm , the experimental evaluation we performed consisted of two parts : In part 1 , we tested empirically the quality of solutions that an locally optimal solver ( either OC-DEC-MDP or VFP )
