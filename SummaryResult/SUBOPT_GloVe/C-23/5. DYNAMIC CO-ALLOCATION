As Figure 2 shows, when an appropriate file section is first selected, it is divided into proper block sizes according to the respective server bandwidths.
The goal is to make the expected finish time of all servers the same.
When a threshold is reached, the co-allocation server stopped dividing the remainder of the file and assigns that remainder as the final section.
UnassignedFileSize is the portion of file A not yet distributed for downloading; initially, UnassignedFileSize is equal to the total size of file A. is the rate that determines how much of the section remains to be assigned.
