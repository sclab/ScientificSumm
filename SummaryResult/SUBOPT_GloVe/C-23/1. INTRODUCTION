Recently, large-scale, data-sharing scientific communities such as those described in [1, 5] used this technology to replicate their large datasets over several sites.
Another way is to use co-allocation technology [17] to download data.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic co-allocation scheme based on co-allocation Grid data transfer architecture called  RecursiveAdjustment Co-Allocation scheme that reduces the idle time spent waiting for the slowest server and improves data transfer performance [24].
Our research approaches are outlined in Section 5, and experimental results and a performance evaluation of our scheme are presented in Section 6.
This can improve the performance compared
