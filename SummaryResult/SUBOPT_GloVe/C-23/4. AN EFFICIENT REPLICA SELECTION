The replica selection server sends the possible destination locations to the information server, which provides performance measurements and predictions of the three system factors described below.
In our model, we consider three system factors that affect replica selection: Network bandwidth: This is one of the most significant Data Grid factors since data files in Data Grid environments are usually very large.
This allows the same data pathways to be used for multiple file transfers.
The client first logins in at a local site and executes the Data Grid platform application , which checks to see if the files are available
