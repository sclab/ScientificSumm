There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G if and only if the following two conditions hold: (i) l(j + 1) > l(j) for j = 1, ..., m − 1, and (ii) l(m) ≤ n. 5.2 K-next-price position auctions In k-next-price position auctions the payment scheme is defined as follows: For every j ∈ K and for every b pj(b) = b(j+k).
We next provide the construction of the valid mediator , which will implement the VCG outcome function in a position auction G , which satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3 : Algorithm for building
