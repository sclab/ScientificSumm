In contrast, for every c > 1, if say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates directly and bids less than cv1, then the T-strategy yields a negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1.
If player 1 does not use the mediator, he should bid at least cv2 in order to get the positions, and therefore his utility cannot exceed v1 − v2.
Note however, that the T-strategy is not a dominant strategy when c > 1; e.g.
FUNCTION BY MEDIATION In general , except for the VCG position auction we do not expect position auctions
