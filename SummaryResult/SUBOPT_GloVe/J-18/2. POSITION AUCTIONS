That is, bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and only if i < k. Given this fixed priority rule we can make the following definitions, which apply to all position auctions: We denote by s(b, i) the position player i is assigned to when the bid profile is b.
If i holds a position then every visitor to this position gives i a revenue of vi > 0, where vi is called the valuation of i.
Hence , the action set of player i in the mediated game is Bi âˆªVi , where conveniently Vi denotes both
