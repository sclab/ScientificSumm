Also, the information concerning the mappings between the agent reputation models and the FORe can be directly inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the integration of a given reputation model ontology and the FORe in an ontology tool with reasoning engine.
Therefore, considering the ontologies which describe the agent reputation models we can define a mapping between these ontologies and the FORe whenever the ontologies use a common vocabulary.
Casare and Sichman [3] used the hybrid approach to show that the FORe serves as a common ontology for several reputation models.
