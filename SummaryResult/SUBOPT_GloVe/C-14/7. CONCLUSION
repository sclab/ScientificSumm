We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to  deployment and sensors.
The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment.
These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment for varying number of sensors deployed in each step.
The minimum exposure is used as a measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the  region.
A mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target
