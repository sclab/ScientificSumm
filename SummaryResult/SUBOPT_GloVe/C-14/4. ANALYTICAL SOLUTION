As the minimum exposure e is a random variable, the cost of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure is reached is also a random variable C. We now derive the expression for the expected value of C. Let ni be the total number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum number of steps S so that nS = M. Note that ni − ni−1 is the number of sensors deployed at step i.
To evaluate the probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor deployment , we make the following approximation : the
