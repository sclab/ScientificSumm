Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.
Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights.
We further assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ S. In this case , Equation 4 reduces to E { C } = ( Cd + n.Cs ) S−1 i=1 i.
