Deploying the M sensors results in the  maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.
The sensors are to be deployed over the region in a random fashion where the sensors  locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the number or density of sensors can be chosen.
By assigning a cost to both single  sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be deployed at first and thereafter can be determined.
The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to determine if it satisfies the desired performance level.
The number
