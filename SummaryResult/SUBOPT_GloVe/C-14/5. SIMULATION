When deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed.
When deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a  desirable exposure level.
5.1 Method The exposure distribution is obtained by collecting  statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a predefined region.
The region monitored is of size 20Ã—20 with a noise ( AWGN ) of variance 1 , so that the signal coming from the target is covered by
