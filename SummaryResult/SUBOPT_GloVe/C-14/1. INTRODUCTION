In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random which corresponds to many practical applications where the region to be monitored is not accessible for precise  placement of sensors.
The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target  detection in a region of interest.
The set of paths to be considered may be constrained by the environment.
The deployment of sensor networks varies with the application considered.
In order to detect a target moving through the region , sensors have to make local observations of the environment and collaborate
