First, we want to study whether the use of various contexts can help the user to better identify term relevance, while not sacrificing the simplicity and compactness of term feedback.
We could, for example, allow the user to dynamically modify terms in a  language model learned from feedback documents. 
Second, currently all terms are presented to the user in a single batch.
We could instead consider  iterative term feedback, by presenting a small number of terms first, and show more terms after receiving user feedback or stop when the refined query is good enough.
We found the best-performing algorithm to
