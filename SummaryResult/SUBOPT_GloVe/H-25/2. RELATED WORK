Although techniques for adjusting query term weights exist for vector space models[17] and probablistic relevance models[9], most of the aforementioned works do not use them, choosing to just append feedback terms to the original query (thus using equal weights for them), which can lead to poorer retrieval performance.
For  example, the study in [12] shows that the user prefers to have explicit knowledge and direct control of which terms are used for query  expansion, and the penetrable interface that provides this freedom is shown to perform better than other interfaces.
The user is found to be not good
