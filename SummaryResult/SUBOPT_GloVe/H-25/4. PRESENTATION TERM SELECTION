In our approach, the top N documents from an initial retrieval using the original query form the source of feedback terms: all terms that appear in them are considered candidates to present to the user.
First, we introduce a background model θB that is estimated from collection statistics and explains the common terms, so that they are much less likely to appear in the presentation list.
The selected terms are then  presented to the user for judgment.
Specifically , we assume the N documents contain K clusters { Ci| i = 1 , 2 , · · · K }
