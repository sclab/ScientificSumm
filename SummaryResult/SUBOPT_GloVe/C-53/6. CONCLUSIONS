As a result, the application of local lag can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems which have large typical network transmission delay (e.g.
GS-DR-LL has significant implications to consistency maintenance approaches.
Compared with traditional DR, GS-DR can eliminate after inconsistency through the synchronization of physical clocks, but it cannot tackle before inconsistency, which would significantly influence the usability and fairness of a game.
As a result, the application of DR can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems which request high consistency (e.g.
In this paper , we proposed a
