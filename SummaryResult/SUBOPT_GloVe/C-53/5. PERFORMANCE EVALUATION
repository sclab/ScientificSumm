In the last step, to each track couple, the inconsistency between them was calculated, and the unit of inconsistency was pixel.
The main purpose of performance evaluation is to study the effects of GS-DR-LL on decreasing before inconsistency in a particular game system under different thresholds, lags, and network transmission delays.
Compared with GS-DR, GS-DR-LL can decrease more inconsistency, and it eliminates most inconsistency when the network transmission delay is 100 ms and the threshold is 4 pixels or 5 degrees.
In order to show the results of inconsistency in a clear way , only parts of the results ,
