In replication based games, network transmission delay makes the states of local and remote sites to be inconsistent, which can cause serious problems, such as reducing the fairness of a game and leading to paradoxical situations etc.
Local lag can achieve significant high consistency, but it is based on operation transmission, which forwards every operation on a shared entity to remote sites.
Due to network transmission delay, when a remote site receives a state update of an entity the state of the entity might have changed at the site sending the state update.
It synchronizes the physical clocks of all
