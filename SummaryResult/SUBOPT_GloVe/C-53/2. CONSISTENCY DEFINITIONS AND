If De(i, j, t1, t2) > De(l, k, t1, t2), it can be stated that between time points t1 and t2, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. In DR, the states of entities are composed of the positions and orientations of entities and some prediction related parameters (e.g.
De(i, j, t) can be used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency at a certain time point.
If De ( i , j , t ) > De ( l ,
