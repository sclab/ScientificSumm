[19] also propose a method of directly maximizing rank-based metrics for ranking on the basis of manifold learning.
Recently methods of â€˜learning to rank" have been applied to ranking model construction and some promising results have been obtained.
In that sense, the  existing methods of Ranking SVM, RankBoost, and RankNet are only able to minimize loss functions that are loosely related to the IR performance measures.
[3] employ Relative Entropy as a loss function and Gradient Descent as an algorithm to train a Neural Network model for ranking in document retrieval.
