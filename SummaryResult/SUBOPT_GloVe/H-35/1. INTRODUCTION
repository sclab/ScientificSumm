Inspired by the work of AdaBoost for classification [9], we propose to develop a boosting algorithm for information  retrieval, referred to as AdaRank.
[8] take a similar approach and perform the learning by using boosting,  referred to as RankBoost.
All the existing methods used for  document retrieval [2, 3, 8, 13, 16, 20] are designed to optimize loss functions loosely related to the IR performance measures, not loss functions directly based on the measures.
Several methods for learning to rank have been developed and applied to document retrieval.
In document retrieval , usually ranking results are evaluated in terms of
