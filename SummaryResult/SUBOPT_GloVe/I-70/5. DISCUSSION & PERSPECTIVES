When the  system works by itself on a fixed data set given during initialization, the final result is equivalent to what we could obtain with a  centralized algorithm.
Most of the work needed to develop those rules consists in finding the relevant statistic information that will support the ontologist. 
The system reacts and stabilizes, we then obtain figure 12 as a  result.
Figure 12: Concept agent tree after taking in account  "hepatitis" Then, the ontologist interacts with the system and adds a new concept described by the term "hepatitis" and linked to the root.
Moreover the
