Curve number 2 represents the average of the value obtained when only the distributed clustering algorithm is activated, not the full rule set.
It is possible to guess this because each concept agent is described by a set of terms and thanks to the "Head-Expansion" term network.
Then , the non cooperation degree μ ( A ) of agent A is : μ ( A ) = max ( μH ( A ) , μB ( A )
