It requires to begin with a quantitative evaluation, based on its  complexity, while comparing it with the algorithm 1 from the previous section.
It can be explained by the low probability that a data set forces the system to create only minimal groups (two items) or maximal (n − 1 elements) for each step of reasoning.
It is bootstrapped in the following way : • a TOP agent having no parent is created , it will be the root of the resulting taxonomy , • an agent is created for each term to be positioned in the taxonomy , they
