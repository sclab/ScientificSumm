Of course, our system still requires more evaluation and validation work to accurately determine the  advantages and flaws of this approach.
Performances of the system are interesting and some aspects are even comparable to their centralized counterpart.
And, more generally it"s likely to be interesting for other design related tasks, even if we"re focusing only on knowledge  engineering in this paper.
It requires analyst supervising and taking in account the ontology aim.
Also from the multi-agent engineering point of view, their use in a dynamic ontology context has shown its relevance.
Our system makes use of
