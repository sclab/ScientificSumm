With those results in mind, we discuss the limits of our system and add as perspectives the  modifications required to reach a complete ontology building solution.
It is evaluated and compared to a more conventional centralized algorithm.
In this paper we present a distributed hierarchical clustering algorithm, core of our approach.
Our system named  Dynamo is designed along this domain but following an original  approach based on an adaptive multi-agent architecture.
We also present how it has been improved using a multi-criteria approach.
Ontologies building from text is still a time-consuming task which justifies the growth of Ontology Learning.
