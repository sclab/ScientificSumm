With this in mind, we now present a two-phase roadmap for improving Mirage: (i) short-term improvements to the current mechanism that mitigate the effects of existing  strategies; and (ii) designing a new mechanism that approximately achieves our three goals simultaneously.
Instead, the mechanism is a continuous scheme that accepts bids as they arrive and makes allocation decisions immediately, thus removing any need to clear auctions.
Among the potential mechanisms we can extend, the LOS scheme [12] seems to be a good starting point.
Finally , another approach to eliminating S4 is to modify the greedy algorithm such that if users
