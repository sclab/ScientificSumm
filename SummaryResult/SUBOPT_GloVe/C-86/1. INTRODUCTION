We made this decision mainly  because designing a strategyproof mechanism remains an open, challenging problem and we wanted to deploy a working  system and gain experience with real users to address our three goals in a timely manner.
Finally, we wanted to identify what other practical problems would emerge in a deployment of a market based system.
The key contribution of this paper is an analysis of such strategic behavior as observed over a four-month time period and proposed refinements for mitigating such  behavior en route to building an approximately strategyproof  repeated combinatorial auction.
The system , which employs a
