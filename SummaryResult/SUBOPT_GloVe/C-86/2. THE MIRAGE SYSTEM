Users compete for testbed resources by submitting bids which specify resource combinations of interest in space/time (e.g., any 32 MICA2 motes for 8 hours anytime in the next two days) along with a maximum value amount the user is willing to pay.
It depicts periods of significant contention extending over multiple consecutive days, in particular near major  deadlines.2 To quantify user valuations for resources, Figure 2 1 The frequency constraints are used to schedule testbed  allocations such that allocations co-scheduled in time do not collide by using the same radio frequency.
