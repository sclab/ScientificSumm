It suggests that we can check the stability of a sample size N and the appropriate reservation value xN simply by calculating the optimal reservation values of a  single agent when deviating towards using samples of sizes N − 1 and N + 1 (keeping the other agents with strategy (N, xN )).
This guarantees that once the  concave expression A(N) − c(N) shifts from a positive value to a negative one (with the increase in N), it cannot become positive again.
An upper bound for the equilibrium number of partners to be considered over a search round is
