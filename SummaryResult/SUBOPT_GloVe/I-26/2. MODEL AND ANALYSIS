We denote by RN (x) the probability that the maximum utility that agent Ai can be  guaranteed when interacting with N agents (i.e., the highest utility to which a commit message will be received) is at most x.
On the other hand, when the utility  associated with a potential partnership opportunity is zero (x = 0) the acceptance probability is non-negligible: lim x→0 Gk(x) = (k − 1) 1−k k−2 (3) This non-intuitive result derives from the fact that there is still a non-negligible probability that the other agent is rejected by all other agents it interacts with.
