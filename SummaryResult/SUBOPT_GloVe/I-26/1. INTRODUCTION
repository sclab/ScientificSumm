of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).
The new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.
The main contributions of this paper are threefold : First , we formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which
