In addition, we use the results presented in [9] to  discuss the importance of opponent modeling in our  ConnectFour adversarial domain.
We explore environment properties and the mental states of agents to derive  behavioral axioms; these behavioral axioms constitute a formal model that serves as a specification and design guideline for agent design in such settings.
However, none of this research dealt with adversarial domains and their implications for agent behavior.
Early research in multiagent systems ( MAS ) considered cooperative groups of agents ; because individual agents had limited resources , or limited access to information ( e.g. ,
