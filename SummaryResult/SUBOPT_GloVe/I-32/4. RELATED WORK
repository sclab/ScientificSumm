The Mâˆ— algorithm presented by Carmel and Markovitch [2] showed a method of incorporating  opponent models into adversary search, while in [3] they used learning to provide a more accurate opponent model in a  2player repeated game environment, where agents" strategies were modeled as finite automata.
[13], which  provided an adversarial planning approach to the game of GO.
As far as we know, our model is the first to provide a formalized model for explicit adversarial environments and agents" behavior in it.
The research mentioned above dealt with adversarial search and the integration of opponent models into classical
