Here we can see that our strategy of enhancing the query model by contextual factors is equivalent to document re-ranking, which is used in [5][15][30].
In these cases, we construct two models for the query: the initial query model containing only the original terms, and a new model containing the added terms.
In this paper, F Qθ is extracted using the 20 blind feedback documents.
Then the document score in Equation ( 1 ) is extended as follows : ( ) ∑∑∑ ∈∈ ∈ == Xi ii Vt Xi D i Qi DQScoretPtPDQScore ) , ( ) |
