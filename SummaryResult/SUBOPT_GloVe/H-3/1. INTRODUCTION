In this paper, we propose to model topic domains, among which the related one(s) will be selected for a given query.
We will also show that it is possible to determine the query domain automatically, and this results in comparable effectiveness to a manual specification of domain.
The shortage of domain knowledge has led to the utilization of general knowledge for query expansion [31], which is more available from resources such as thesauri, or it can be automatically extracted from documents [24][27].
Therefore , the relation has been applied to all queries containing program in previous studies ,
