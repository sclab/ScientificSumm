Therefore, we employ an EM process to extract the specific part of the domain as follows: we assume that the documents in a domain are generated by a domain-specific model (to be extracted) and general language model (collection model).
Therefore, we further construct a  sub-domain model more related to the given query, by using a subset of in-domain documents that are related to the query.
MODELS As in previous studies, we exploit a set of documents already classified in each domain.
The score depending on the domain model is then as follows : ∑∈ = Vt D Dom QDom tPtPDQScore
