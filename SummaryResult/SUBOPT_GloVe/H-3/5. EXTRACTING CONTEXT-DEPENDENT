The solution we propose is to add more context terms into A, so that it is applicable only when all the terms in A appear in a query.
A single term in A means that the relation is applicable to all the queries containing that term.
Adding more terms into the condition will create many rarely applicable relations ; • In most cases , an ambiguous word such as Java can be effectively disambiguated by one useful context word such as computer or hotel ; • The addition of more terms will also lead to a higher space and time
