Similarly to some previous studies, we propose to model topic domains instead of the user.
This work can be further improved on several aspects, including other methods to extract term relations, to integrate more context words in conditions and to identify query domains.
We showed in this paper that factors within the query are also important - they help select the appropriate term relations to apply in query expansion.
This work also shows that the language modeling framework is appropriate for integrating many contextual factors.
Traditional IR approaches usually consider the query as the only element available for the user information
