As the parameter λ only affects document model, we will set it to the same value in all our experiments.
The mixture weights αi of component models are trained on the same training data using the following method of line search [11] to maximize the Mean Average Precision (MAP): each parameter is considered as a search direction.
We start by searching in one direction - testing all the values in that direction, while keeping the values in other directions unchanged.
In order to avoid being trapped at a local maximum , we started from 10 random points and the best setting
