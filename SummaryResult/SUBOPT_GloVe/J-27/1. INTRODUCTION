However, these methods do not consider the complexity of the demand functions and do not use any probabilistic model of the observations.
One of the common assumptions in this theory is that the preference relation is represented by a utility function and that agents strive to maximize their utility given a budget constraint.
Given  observations of price and demand, under what circumstances can we conclude that the data is consistent with the  behavior of a utility maximizing agent equipped with a monotone concave utility function and subject to a budget constraint?
Classical economic theory explains the incentives of the agents
