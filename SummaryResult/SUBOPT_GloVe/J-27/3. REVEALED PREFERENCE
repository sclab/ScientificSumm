Now, C has weight svavu+ X (k,l)∈C\(v,u) skak,l ≥ svav,u+sp(n−1) max (i,j)∈S {aij } ≥ 0, i.e., C has non-negative weight ✷ Algorithm 1 returns in polynomial time a hypothesis that is a piecewise linear function and agrees with the labeling of the observation namely sample error zero.
Let A be an n × n matrix with entries aij = pi · (xj − xi) (aij and aji are independent), aii = 0 and let D(A) be the weighted digraph associated with A.
D ( A ) has no negative cycles , hence
