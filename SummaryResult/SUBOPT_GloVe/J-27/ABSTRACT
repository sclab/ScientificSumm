The present paper complements this line of research by introducing a statistical model and a measure of complexity through which we are able to study the learnability of classes of demand functions and derive a degree of confidence in the forecasts.
We also present a learning algorithm that is an adaptation of a new proof of Afriat"s theorem due to Teo and Vohra [17].
[3, 4] continued this line of work studying nonparametric methods to forecasts demand.
Our results show that the class of all demand functions has unbounded complexity and therefore is not learnable , but that
