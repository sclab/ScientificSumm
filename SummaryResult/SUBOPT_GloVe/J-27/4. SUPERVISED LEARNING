Then any learning algorithm L for C has sample complexity satisfying mL(ε, δ) ≥ 1 2 fatC(4dε) An analog of this theorem for real valued functions with a tighter bound can be found in [2], this version will suffice for our needs.
The minimal mL is called the sample complexity of C. Note that in the definition there is no mention of the time complexity to find h in H and evaluating h(p).
W.l.g we may assume the error is bounded ( since we are looking at what is essentially a finite set ) therefore the probability
