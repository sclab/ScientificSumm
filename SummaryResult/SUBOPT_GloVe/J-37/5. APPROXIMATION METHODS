This  technique provides ex post guarantees about the worst-case  performance of a strategy, and can be used independently of the method that is used to compute the strategies.
A threshold on can also be used as a termination criterion for using the method as an anytime algorithm.
Thus, with this threshold as a parameter, we have a knob to turn that in one extreme (threshold = 0) yields an optimal  abstraction and in the other extreme (threshold = âˆž) yields a highly abstracted game (this would in effect restrict  players to ignoring all signals, but still observing actions).
This will be most
