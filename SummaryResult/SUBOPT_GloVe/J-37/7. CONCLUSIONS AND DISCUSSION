It is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller, so GameShrink has time and space complexity sublinear in 8 Bridge is also a game of imperfect information, and partition search does not find the equilibrium for that game either.
That game tree size has required us to use the approximation version of GameShrink (as well as round-based abstraction) [16, 15]. 
We also discussed how (in a two-player zero-sum game), linear programming can be used in an anytime manner to generate approximately  optimal strategies of increasing quality.
Such ( non-game-theoretic ) techniques are unlikely
