However, it is not game theory-based (it does not consider information sets in the game tree), and thus does not solve for the equilibrium of a game of  imperfect information, such as poker.8 Another difference is that the abstraction is defined by an expert human while our abstractions are determined automatically.
However, a significant difference to our work is that Sprouts is a game of perfect information.
The main result is that a game can be derived from another by a sequence of those transformations if and only if the games have the same pure reduced normal form.
