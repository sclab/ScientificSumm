With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning  different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.
In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.
In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.
In this case,  Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of objects that evicted other useful data from the cache.
SelectSort2 , another micro-benchmark executed the same queries but
