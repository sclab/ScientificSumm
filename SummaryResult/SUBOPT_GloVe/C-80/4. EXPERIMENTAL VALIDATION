For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 .
For each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we measured results from the two configurations listed below: â€¢ Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a).
The bandwidth and latency  constraints were only applied to the link between the application server and the database for the native case and between the application server and the proxy for the Ganesh case.
