This proxy, which can be shared by multiple front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that  communicates with the database.
If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh driver"s cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.
To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of what result fragments are available in the Ganesh driver"s cache.
It is important to note that using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow interpretation of the
