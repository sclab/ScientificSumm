With the growing use of dynamic web content generated from  relational databases, traditional caching solutions for throughput and latency improvements are ineffective.
Using two benchmarks representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our  prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much as twofold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as tenfold for data intensive ones.
We describe a middleware layer called Ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of queries or results.
These benefits do not require any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the back-end database.
