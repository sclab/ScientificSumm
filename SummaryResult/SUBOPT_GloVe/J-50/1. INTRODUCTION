Finally, for some rules (such as the Condorcet and Bucklin rules), we need to introduce a more complex communication protocol to achieve the best possible upper 1 For two of the rules that we study that are  intersectionmonotonic, namely the approval and Condorcet rules,  Segal"s results can in fact be used to give alternative proofs of our lower bounds.
Segal then uses this
