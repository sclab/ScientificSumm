Therefore, technically, we do not prove the lower bound for (number of candidates, number of voters) pairs (m, n) that do not satisfy these assumptions (for  example, if we make the above assumption, then we technically do not prove the lower bound for any pair (m, n) in which n is even).
This will strengthen our lower bound results ( because it implies that even finding out whether one given candidate wins is hard ) .5 Thus , a fooling set in our context is a set of vectors of votes so that a wins ( does not win )
