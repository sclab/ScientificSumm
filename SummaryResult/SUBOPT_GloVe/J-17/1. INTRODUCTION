This kind of analysis has been the method of choice in the design of truthful mechanisms for  singledimensional domains, where value-monotonicity yields a  convenient characterization enabling one to concentrate on the algorithmic side of the problem (see, e.g., [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]).
Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem.
The main technique , and one of the novelties , underlying our constructions and proofs , is that we do
