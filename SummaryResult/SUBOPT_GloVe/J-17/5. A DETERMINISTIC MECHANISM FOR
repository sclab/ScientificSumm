So if we augment x to a max-flow for (p1 , TL ), then by Lemma 5.8 (with p = pL and p = p1 ), all the jobs corresponding to n2,1 L must be assigned in this max-flow.
If pij = L, then we must have ni p,T ∗(p) = T∗ (p), otherwise we could have assigned j to i in step 2 to obtain a flow of larger value.
Take the prefix-maximal flow x2 for ( p2 , T2 ) , truncate it at TL , and remove all the jobs from this assignment that are counted in n2,1 H , that is
