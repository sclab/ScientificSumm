We can now rephrase the above price-assignment problem: we seek an assignment to the variables {Pa}a∈A such that Pa − Pb ≤ δa,b ∀a, b ∈ A (2) This is easily solved by looking at the allocation graph and applying a standard basic result of graph theory.
Cycle monotonicity is best described in the abstract social choice setting: there is a finite set A of alternatives, there are m players, and each player has a private type  (valuation function) v : A → R, where vi(a) should be interpreted as i"s value for alternative a.
