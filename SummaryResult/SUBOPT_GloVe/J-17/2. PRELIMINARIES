The mechanism"s goal is to compute a schedule that has near-optimal makespan with respect to the true processing times; a machine i is however only interested in maximizing its own utility, Pi âˆ’ li, where li is its load under the output assignment, and may declare false processing times if this could increase its utility.
We emphasize that both of our domains are multidimensional, since each machine i needs to specify a vector saying which jobs are low and high on it. 
A ( direct-revelation ) mechanism thus consists of a tuple ( x , P ) :
