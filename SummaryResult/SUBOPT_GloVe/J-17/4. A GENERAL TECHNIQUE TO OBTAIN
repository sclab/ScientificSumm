Algorithm 1 Let A be any algorithm that on any input p outputs a possibly fractional assignment x such that xij > 0 implies that pij â‰¤ T, where T is the makespan of x.
Then there exist payments P such that the  mechanism M = (A, P ) is truthful in expectation.
We will show that for every such maximal segment k , k +1, .
Taking A in Algorithm 1 to be the algorithm that returns an LP-optimum assignment satisfying the required  conditions (see [18, 25]), we obtain a 3-approximation mechanism.
This conversion works even when the approximation algorithm returns only a fractional
