To find out the important part of the ad, the authors explore using different ad sections (bid phrase, title, body) as a  basis for the ad vector.
The winning strategy out of the first five requires the bid phrase to appear on the page and then ranks all such ads by the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors.
During evaluation, each page phrase up to length 5 is considered as potential result and evaluated against a trained classifier.
Online advertising in general and contextual advertising in particular are emerging areas of research.
