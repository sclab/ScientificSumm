Having decided which sequences will be compared by each node, GridBlast sends the sequences, the executable files and the whole database to the chosen node.
GBTK is a master/slave application that receives the sequences and the name of the genetic database.
If the node is not available, the less loaded node is chosen and the database is copied to it.
It distributes sequences among the grid nodes using two allocation policies: FCFS and minmax.
