A(N, S) = 1, while work units are still left to allocate (4) In SS, the maximum imbalance is limited by the  processing time of a work unit in the slowest node.
WeightFactor(m, si, S) was defined by [13] (equation 2) and provides weights for each slave si, based on its statically known processing rate (WorkerRate).
3.2 Task Allocation Strategies Given a master/slave application composed by a master m and S slaves , the allocation function allocate ( m , si , N , S ) determines how many tasks out of N must be assigned to a slave
