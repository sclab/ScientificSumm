As future work, we intend to run PackageBLAST in a  geographically dispersed grid, to evaluate the impact of high network latencies in the allocation policies and in PSS.
Also, we showed that, in our testbed, there is no allocation policy that always achieves the best performance and that makes evident the  importance of providing multiple policies.
We also defined a strategy, PSS, that adapts the chosen  policy to a heterogeneous non-dedicated grid environment.
Moreover, we showed that the introduction of PSS led to very good performance gains for some policies.
The results collected by running PackageBLAST with 5 allocation policies
