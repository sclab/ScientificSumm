In the seeding step, a query  sequence is split in portions called words of size W. These words are matched to database sequences and used as  alignment seeds if their scores are higher than a threshold T. In the extension step, alignments are generated from seeds.
Sensitivity is the rate at which the method fails to identify similar sequences whereas sensibility is the rate at which the method identifies sequences that are not similar [7].
Given an alignment between two sequences, a score is  usually associated for it as follows (figure 1).
A new parameter , S , is used
