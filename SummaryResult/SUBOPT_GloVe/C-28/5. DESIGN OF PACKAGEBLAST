We also propose a strategy to compute grid nodes execution weight which distributes work units (database segments) to grid nodes according to their current computational power.
Thus, we propose the use of a framework where many allocation policies can be  incorporated.
We opted to replicate the segmented database in every slave grid node to improve data accesses times and to  provide a potential for fault tolerance.
The expression used for work unit allocation is shown in equation 11 , where A ( N , P ) is the allocation policy for a system with N workload units and P nodes
