This led to the idea of grid computing, which involves  cooperative and secure sharing of non-dedicated and  heterogeneous resources that are geographically distributed [5].
Grid applications usually do not have high communication rates and many of them follow the master/slave model [13].
Biological sequence comparison (or sequence alignment) is one of the most important problems in computational  biology, given the number and diversity of the sequences and the frequency on which it is needed to be solved daily.
For this reason, heuristics like BLAST [3] were proposed to reduce execution time.
The choice of the best allocation policy depends on
