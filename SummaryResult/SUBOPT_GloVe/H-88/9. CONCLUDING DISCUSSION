While this style of user interface may help a user cope with overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be applicable, by determining the best elements to include in each cluster.
For example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element, both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship.
For example, when XML retrieval results are presented to users it may be desirable to cluster structurally related elements together, visually illustrating the relationships between them.
