In section 8 the algorithm is extended to apply increasing weights, lowering the score, when a term appears in more than one reported element. 
Instead, they apply the weights at the term frequency level, with an occurrence of a query term t in the title making a greater contribution to the score than an occurrence in the body.
For example, assume a paragraph with score p is reported in step 1.
In equation 1 , xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt , where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and zt is
