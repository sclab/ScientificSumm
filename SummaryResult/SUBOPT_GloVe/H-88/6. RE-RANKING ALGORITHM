However, since the contents of each descendant are entirely contained in a reported  element its final score may be computed, and it is removed from S and added to F. In order to determine the time complexity of the  algorithm, first note that a node may be an argument to Down at most once.
The score is computed using equation 1, with the xt value for each term determined by a combination of the values in x.f and x.g.
At the start of each iteration , the unreported node at the front of S has the greatest adjusted score ,
