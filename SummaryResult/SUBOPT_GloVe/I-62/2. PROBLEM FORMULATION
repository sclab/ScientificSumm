The approach here is to sum the difference between the real value of a state to the maximal Q-value of this state if resource res cannot be used for all states in a trajectory given by the  policy of task ta.
Indeed, in Lines 5 and 6 of the bounded-backup function, if QU (a, s) â‰¤ L(s) then action a may be pruned from the action space of s. In Line 13 of this function, a state can be labeled as solved if the  difference between the lower and upper bounds is lower than .
For our problem ,
