Indeed, an optimal allocation is one where the resources are distributed in the best way to all tasks, and our lower bound heuristically does that. 
For the local constraints, at most 1 resource of each type can be  allocated to execute tasks in a specific state.
Q-decomposition permits to diminish the planning time significantly in our problem settings, and seems a very efficient approach when a group of agents have to allocate resources which are only available to themselves, but the  actions made by an agent may influence the reward obtained by at least another agent.
This constraint is also
