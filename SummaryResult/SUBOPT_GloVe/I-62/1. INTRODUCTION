This efficient trajectory of state updates can be combined to the approach proposed here since this paper focusses on the definition of tight bounds, and efficient state update for a constrained resource allocation problem.
The only  condition on the use of our bounds is to be in the context of stochastic constrained resource allocation.
When implemented with heuristic search, since the number of states and actions to consider when computing the optimal policy is exponentially reduced compared to other known approaches, Q-decomposition  allows to formulate the first optimal decomposed heuristic search algorithm in a stochastic environments.
