As suggested by the theory we have developed, for the absolute model the change to the average price grows linearly with the number of deletions and remains very small (note the vastly  different scales of the y-axis in the panels for the absolute and relative models in the figure).
As just one specific  representative example, notice that for QCOM on the cleaned data, the relative model effect of just a single deletion on the closing price is in excess of a full percentage point.
In Figure 6 , we show how the percentage change to the executed volume varies with
