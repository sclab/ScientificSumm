We consider a sequence Σ such that after an initialization period there have been no executions, the buy book has 2 orders at price 10, and the sell book has two orders at price 12 and 2 orders with value 12+y, where y is a positive integer that will be determined by the analysis.
Therefore, the next two buy orders with ∆ = +1 are executed, and afterwards we have that the bid is 11 and the ask is 12 + y.
Without loss of generality let us consider sequences in which all prices are integer-valued , in which case the smallest
