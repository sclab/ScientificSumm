After giving specific (worst-case) relative price sequences in which small perturbations  generate large changes in basic statistics (for example, altering the number of shares traded by a factor of two), we proceed to demonstrate that the difference in stability properties of the two models is more than merely theoretical.
We first show that for any fixed sequence of prices in the  absolute model, the modification of a single order has a bounded and extremely limited impact on the subsequent evolution of the books.
Note that such positioning may depend on more complex features of the order books than just the
