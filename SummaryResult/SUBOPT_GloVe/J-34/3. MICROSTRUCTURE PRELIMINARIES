Now regardless the state that we were in, b1 is still only in one buy book (but with a different price), and thus we remain in the same state in S. The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows from the above lemmas. 
For the case when the order appears only in one set of books, without loss of generality we assume that the cancellation cancels a buy order at b1.
If at any time the current books ( A1 , B1 ) and ( A2 , B2 ) are in the set ab ( and thus identical ) , then modifying
