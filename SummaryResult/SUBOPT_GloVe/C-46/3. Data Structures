For a simple  interval skip graph, however, this maximum value for an entry must be computed over all entries preceding it in the index, as searches may begin anywhere in the data structure, rather than at a distinguished root element.
It may be easily seen that in the worse case the  insertion of a single interval (one that covers all existing intervals in the index) will trigger the update of all entries in the index, for a worst-case insertion cost of O(n).
In this way , for instance , the two chains at level 1 always contain n/2 entries
