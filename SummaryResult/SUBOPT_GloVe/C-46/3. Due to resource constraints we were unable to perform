The latency also depends on the number of packets transmitted in response to a query-the larger the amount of data retrieved by a query, the greater the latency.
As the data retrieved by a query is increased, the latency increases in steps, where each step denotes the overhead of an additional packet.
The goal of adaptive summarization is to dynamically vary the summary size so that these two costs are balanced.
Not surprisingly, the overhead seen at the sensor is independent of the index size.
With the interval summarization method we are using , this information loss will never cause
