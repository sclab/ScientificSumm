Our prototype employs the MultiHopLEPSM routing protocol with the BMAC layer configured in the low-power mode with a 11% duty cycle (one of the default BMAC [22] parameters) Our TSAR implementation on the Mote involves a data  gathering task that periodically obtains sensor readings and logs these reading to flash memory.
In addition , to reduce the power consumption of the radio while still making the sensor node available for queries , low power listening is enabled , in which the radio receiver is periodically powered up for a short interval to sense the channel for transmissions , and the
