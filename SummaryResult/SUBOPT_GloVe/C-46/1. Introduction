Archival storage of past sensor data requires a storage system, the key  attributes of which are: where the data is stored, whether it is indexed, and how the application can access this data in an energy-efficient manner with low latency.
Storage at the remote sensor is in effect treated as appendage of the proxy, resulting in low  implementation complexity, which makes it ideal for small,  resourceconstrained sensor platforms.
A read request requires a lookup in the in-network hash table to locate the node that stores the data 39 item ; observe that the presence of an index eliminates the need
