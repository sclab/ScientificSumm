One section of the flash memory on each sensor node is programmed with data points from the trace; these observations are then replayed during an experiment, logged to the local archive (located in flash memory, as well), and reported to the proxy.
Our results demonstrate this behavior, and show as well that performance of delete-which also involves an initial traversal followed by pointer updates at each level-incurs a similar cost.
To ensure that all data on sensors remains accessible, even in the event of failure of a proxy holding index entries for that data, we  incorporate redundant index entries.
