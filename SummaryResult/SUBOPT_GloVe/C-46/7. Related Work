The RISE platform [21] being developed as part of the NODE project at UCR addresses the issues of hardware platform support for large amounts of storage in remote sensor nodes, but not the indexing and querying of this data.
In addition to storage and indexing techniques specific to sensor networks, many distributed, peer-to-peer and spatio-temporal index structures are relevant to our work.
While this paper focuses on building an ordered index structure for range queries, we will explore the use of other index structures for alternate queries over sensor data. 
In this section , we review prior work on storage
