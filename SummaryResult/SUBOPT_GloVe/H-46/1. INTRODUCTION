The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting.
For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is  representative of the type of intranet that we described above.
The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects.
In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of
