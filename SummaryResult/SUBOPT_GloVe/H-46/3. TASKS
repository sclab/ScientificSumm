In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.
We can state this  problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an  expert given the query topic q?
This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 
Our task , then , is to estimate p ( ki|ca ) , which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p ( q|ca ) , where the topic ki is represented
