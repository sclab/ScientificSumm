To examine expertise retrieval in this setting, we introduced (and released) the UvT Expert collection as a representative case of such knowledge intensive organizations.
Typically, the amount of available data in such an organization (e.g., a university, a research institute, or a research lab) is limited when compared to the W3C collection that has mostly been used for the experimental evaluation of expertise retrieval so far.
We evaluated how current state-of-the-art models for expert finding and profiling performed in this new setting and then refined these models in order to try and exploit the different characteristics within the data environment
