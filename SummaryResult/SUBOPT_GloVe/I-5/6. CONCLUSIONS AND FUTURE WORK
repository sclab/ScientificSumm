A simple decision mechanism based on different beliefs of the agent creates an emergent behaviour that leads to effective resource  allocation.
In the case of a server becomes  unavailable, the agents can adapt quickly to this new situation by exploring new resources or remain at the home server if an allocation is not possible.
In the near future we will investigate if an automatic  adaptation of the decay rate of historical information our  algorithm is possible and can improve the resource allocation performance.
This process is adaptive and has a strong feedback as allocation decisions influence indirectly decisions of other
