The first experiment show the  performance in a stable environment where a number of agents allocate tasks to servers that provide a constant amount of resources.
This  initial exploration phase shows that the average resource load of each server has a similar level.
The standard deviation of the resource loads are small for each server, which indicates that our distributed approach find stable solutions in almost every run.
- n-distribution predictor : uses a random value from the frequency distribution of the n last history values - n-mirror predictor : p ( n ) = 2 · H − yn
