In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.
When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now  welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.
