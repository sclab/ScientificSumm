Finally, results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of cheating. 
The results for the case of a cheating seller in a second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as endpoints along a continuum.
The case of agents cheating in a first-price auction showed the robustness of the first-price auction equilibrium when agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution.
We also explored the effect of overbidding on the best response bidding strategy for other distributions , and showed that even for relatively simple
