In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.
Since we have left F(Â·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agent"s bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.
The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will
