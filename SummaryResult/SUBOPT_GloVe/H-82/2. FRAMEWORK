2.3 Problem formalization Theoretically, the problem of query selection can be formalized as follows: We assume that the crawler downloads pages from a Web site that has a set of pages S (the rectangle in Figure 5).
In the most common case, the query cost consists of a number of factors, including the cost for submitting the query to the site, retrieving the result index page (Figure 3(a)) and downloading the actual pages (Figure 3(b)).
Based on this  information our query selection algorithm can then select the best queries that cover the content of the Web site.
