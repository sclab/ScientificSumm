(1) the number of new  documents that can be obtained from the query qi and (2) the cost of issuing the query qi.
We may consider a number of different ways to estimate P(qi), including the  following: 1.
Now assume that we submit query qi to the Web site, but due to a limitation in the number of results that we get back, we retrieve the set qi (small circle in Figure 8) instead of the set qi (dashed circle in Figure 8).
Their main idea is ( 1 ) to estimate the three parameters , α , β
