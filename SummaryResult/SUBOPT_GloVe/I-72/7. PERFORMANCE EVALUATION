With these test cases, we are interested in finding the number of  iterations that are required for the producer to generate an acceptable offer for the consumer.
When the results are examined, considering semantic closeness increases the performance. 
We apply a variety of scenarios on this dataset in order to see the performance differences.
Note that these preferences are internal to the consumer and the producer tries to learn these during negotiation.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed systems in respect to learning technique they used , DCEA and ID3 , by comparing them with the CEA , RO
