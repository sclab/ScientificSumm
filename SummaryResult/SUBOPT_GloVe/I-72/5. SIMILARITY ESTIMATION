For each level, we multiply the similarity by m and do not consider the sibling factor in the similarity estimation.
In order to evaluate the similarity of feature vector, we firstly estimate the similarity for feature one by one and take the average sum of these similarities.
For example, the cardinality of the first attribute is two and the others is equal to one for the given hypothesis such as {Light, Moderate, (Red, White)}.
This means that we have to consider the effect of n when measuring similarity.
Otherwise , we compute the common parent of the two nodes and
