We observe in Figure 5 that more replicas are placed with payments than without when α is between 0.7 and 1.3, the only range of significant undersupply in the power-law case.
We observe in Figure 4 that for α ≥ 0.4, the average number of replicas of Nash equilibria gets closer with payments to that of the social optimum than it does without.
The OPoA is equal to one in the figure when the same number of replicas are placed.
The set of servers with demand is random for p < 1 , so we calculate the expected PoA by
