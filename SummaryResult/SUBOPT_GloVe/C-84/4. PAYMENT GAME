Having set ti to α for i in Nc means that any node in N is at least as well off lowering its threshold and replicating as bidding α to some node in Nc to make it replicate, so we may disregard the latter as a profitable strategy.
By observation 1, to ensure that each i in No does not deviate, we require that if is the nearest node to i in No, then Èj∈Qi bj is at least (α − di ).
Let No be the set of nodes that replicate the object and Nc = N − No be
