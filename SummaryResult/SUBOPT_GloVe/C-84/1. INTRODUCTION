However, most such systems assume that servers cooperate with one another by following protocols optimized for overall system performance, regardless of the costs incurred by each server.
In the payment model, however, the game can always implement a Nash equilibrium that is same as the social optimum, so the optimistic price of anarchy is one.
Game theory predicts that such a situation will end up in a Nash equilibrium, that is, a set of (possibly randomized) strategies with the property that no player can benefit by changing its strategy while the other players keep their strategies unchanged [28].
