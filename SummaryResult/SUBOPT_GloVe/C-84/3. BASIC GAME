In this analysis we use simply α in place of αij , since we deal with a single object and we assume placement cost is the same for all servers.
dkj < α (5) The first condition guarantees that there is a server that places the replica within distance α of each server i.
The extent to which Ci(S) represents actual cost incurred by server i is beyond the scope of this paper; we will assume that an appropriate cost function of the form of Equation 3 can be defined.
In addition , when we compute the price of anarchy ,
