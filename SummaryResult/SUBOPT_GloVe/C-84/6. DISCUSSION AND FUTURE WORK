Another  observation we made was that the number of replicas in a Nash  equilibrium can be more than the number of replicas in the social  optimum even without payments.
In  addition, we want to run large-scale simulations to observe the change in the price of anarchy as the network size increases.
In our analyses, we assume that all nodes have the same demand.
We also want to look at the following aggregation effect.
However , if we aggregate n − 1 nodes into one node with demand n − 1 , the price of anarchy becomes O ( 1 )
