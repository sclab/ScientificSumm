Our result is from a single run on passage retrieval in which it is better than the best reported result by 22.68% in passage retrieval and at the same time, 9.14% better in aspect retrieval, and 1.33% better in document retrieval (Since the average precision of each individual query was not reported, we can not apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to calculate the significance of difference between our performance and the best reported result.).
The overall performance in terms of MAP is 35.50%, which is about 22.92% above the best reported result [9].
As a consequence , excellent retrieval results
