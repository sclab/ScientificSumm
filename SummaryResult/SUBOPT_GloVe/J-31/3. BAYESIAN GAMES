Now, suppose that there is a pure strategy for the leader that will give the leader a utility of 1.
Thus, it cannot be the case that for some edge e = (v1, v2) ∈ E, the probability that the leader plays one of sv1 and sv2 is at least 2/K, because then the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 when it has type θe would be at least 2 K 2K 3 = 4/3 > 1.
For every pure follower strategy t , we compute a mixed strategy for the leader for every one of the leader '' s
