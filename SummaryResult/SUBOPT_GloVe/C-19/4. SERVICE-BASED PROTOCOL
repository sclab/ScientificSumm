Note that a protocol module Ti, that has an interceptor bound to a service interface, is able to modify requests, replies and notifications.
To ensure that one single listener handles a reply, a module Pi has to identify, each time it issues a request, the listener to handle the possible reply.
When P1 issues a request req to the service interface t, the executer-interceptor of T1 is executed.
In Figure 3 , module Q1 contains an executer bound to service interface t and a listener bound to service interface u. Module Q1 can generate replies and notifications to service interface
