In this paper, we propose a new approach for  building modular protocols, that is based on a service  abstraction.
Section 4 describes our new approach, which is based on service abstraction.
Section 3 presents the main characteristics of event-based frameworks, and features that are distinct for each framework.
To validate our claims, we have  implemented SAMOA - an experimental protocol framework that is purely based on the service-based approach to module composition and implementation.
We compare this new approach with the common, event-based approach.
