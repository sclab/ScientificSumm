a protocol module can interact with all other  protocol modules in the same stack, not only with the protocol modules directly above and below.
A protocol is implemented as a set of identical protocol modules located on different machines.
A request by a protocol module Pi is an asynchronous call by Pi of another protocol module.
Below, we define the  different kinds of interaction between protocol modules.
• Requests are issued by protocol modules.
• Notifications can be used by a protocol module to inform ( possibly many ) protocol modules in the same stack about the occurrence of a
