VOs should allow for two kinds of non-determinism  corresponding to choices autonomous agents can make, viz., i) the one  arising when there is more than one edge leaving a state; and ii) the one arising from variables in the formulae Ï• labelling an edge, for which the agent carrying out the action instantiates.
Notice, however, that in the VO specification we do not restrict the syntax of the formulae: variables may appear in them, and when an agent performs an actual action then any variables of the specified action must be assigned values.
We formally represent our VOs as finite-state
