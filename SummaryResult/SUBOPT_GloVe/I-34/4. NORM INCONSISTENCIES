The conflict resolution algorithm can be applied without change to accumulate a maximal conflict set ΣMAX c for each prohibition in Ω that unifies with obligations. 
With Definition 7, we 3 The combinatorial effort is not necessary anymore if instead we maintain a set of norms conflict-free: each time a new norm is to be introduced then we compare it with the existing ones, thus making the maintenance process of linear complexity.
We can reuse the machinery, introduced above for  resolving conflicts between permissions and prohibitions, in order to a) detect and b) resolve such inconsistencies.
