Ghosts include their distance to such points in their action decisions, achieving the  result of gradient following without the computational expense of maintaining a pheromone field. 
Dispositions are relatively stable, and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE, while Emotions vary based on the agent"s disposition and the stimuli to which it is  exposed.
Key elements of the BEE  architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute.
