In both cases, we use a CEP (circular error probable) measure of accuracy, the radius of the circle that one would have to draw around each prediction to capture 50% of the actual unit locations.
In the experiments reported here, we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way.
Human observers in each game were able to detect a total of 13 of the cowards.
The paths in the resulting set over all ghosts vary in how likely they are , the risk they pose to their own
