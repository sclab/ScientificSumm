Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.
These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.
Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g.
a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.
If multiple descriptors are used (e.g.
Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information : Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color ( based on Scalable Color
