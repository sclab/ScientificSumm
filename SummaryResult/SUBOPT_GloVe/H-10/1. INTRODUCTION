In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.
As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian  Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is  usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g.
the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.
However , unlike spectral clustering , which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [ 2 ] ,
