Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the  cluster membership of xj.
The basic idea is that , for each document vector xi ( 1 i n ) , we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni , and
