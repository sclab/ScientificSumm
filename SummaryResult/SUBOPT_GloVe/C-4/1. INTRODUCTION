Let us now consider the case that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more important (designated by +l) or less important (-1) due to any of the above sensitivity constraints.
441 Figure 1: Schematic utility functions dependent on the loss of more (+l) and less (-1) important packets more important with regard to user perception than others of the same flow.
Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement.
Figure 1 a ) shows a generic utility function describing the applicationlevel Quality
