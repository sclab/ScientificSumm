We have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm which is able to control loss patterns without changing the amount of loss and characterized its performance for the loss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity.
Contrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the concealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break at transitions within the speech signal however, thus  showing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.
Such schemes can  better accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are difficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity of both the codec and the redundancy generator.
We have then developed intraflow loss
