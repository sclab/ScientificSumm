As it should be avoided to introduce reordering of the packets of a flow in the network we consider mechanisms for the management of a single queue with different priority levels.
The necessary relationship between the drop probabilities for packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85 follows ( note that this relationship is valid both at the end-tend level and every individual hop ) : Let a = a0 + a+ , +a-~ be the overall number of emitted packets by an FT flow and a , , + E [ -l , O , +l ]
