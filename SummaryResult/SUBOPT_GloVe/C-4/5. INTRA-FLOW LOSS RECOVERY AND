The results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that, while the loss of some of the +l packets has some  measurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be considered to be very low. 
This also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a minor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained.
This can be explained as follows : if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution , the estimate is more robust if all data is included ( note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P
