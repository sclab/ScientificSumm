Notice that this  calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds.
Also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together.
Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.
Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and assuming that the CPU is always active when a node
