If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.
They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.
In fact, the access points need not be statically located.
If there is no  witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.
