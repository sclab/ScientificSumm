However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers.
Similarly, the witness records  generated by 1 at record times 10, 15 and 16 (see Table 1) have all been generated due a single contact between access point A and node 1.
For example, the location time in some witness records is not the same as the record time.
The number of hikers in
