While CenWits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.
In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined  storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store  important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.
Using groups and partitions , the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors , thereby reducing the amount of memory
