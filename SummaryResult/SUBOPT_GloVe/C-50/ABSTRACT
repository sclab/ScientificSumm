It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important  information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and  intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.
This paper describes the design, implementation and  evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits.
A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.
CenWits uses several small, commonly-available RF-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.
