Some indicators (and the corresponding algorithms that compute them) have been found useful in this respect, and are nowadays well known: Inlinks (the number of links to a Web page), PageRank [7], and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) [5].
In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method for constructing a network, specifically a weighted complete bidirectional directed bipartite graph, on a set of TREC  topics and participating systems.
We then apply  analysis methods originally developed for search applications to the resulting network.
In passing , we also provide a small generalization to Kleinberg '' s HITS algorithm , as well
