The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.
For instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of AP.
DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.
Hopefully , further analyses of the graph defined in this paper , according to the approach described , can be insightful for a better
