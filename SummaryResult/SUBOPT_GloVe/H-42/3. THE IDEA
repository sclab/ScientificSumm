On the basis of Tables 2a and 2b, we can also define two new measures of system effectiveness and topic ease, i.e., a Normalized MAP (MAP), obtained by averaging the APA values on one row in Tab.
The second normalization removes the influence of the single system effectiveness on topic ease : by subtracting from each AP ( si , tj ) the MAP ( si ) value , we obtain normalized AP values ( APM ( si , tj ) , Normalized AP according to MAP ) : APM ( si , tj ) = AP ( si ,
