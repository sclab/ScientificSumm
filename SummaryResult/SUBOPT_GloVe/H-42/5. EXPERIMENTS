This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).
In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).
We also observe that hub values are positive, whereas  authority assumes, as predicted, both positive and negative values.
Let us analyze the correlations more in detail.
It means that system effectiveness in
