We could also apply the PageRank algorithm to the network; the meaning of the PageRank of a node is not quite so  obvious as Inlinks and Outlinks, but it also seems a sensible measure of either system effectiveness or topic ease: if a  system is effective, it will have several incoming links with high 1 Usually, the sum of the weights on the incoming arcs to each node is used in place of the average; since the graph is complete, it makes no difference.
Therefore we can have a generalized version ( or rather a generalized interpretation , since the
