We generated our features using the scores of existing retrieval functions on these queries.
While our method is agnostic to the meaning of the  features, we chose to use existing retrieval functions as a simple yet effective way of acquiring useful features.
For each F and each function f âˆˆ F, we chose 50 values for Kf which are reasonably spaced and capture the sensitive region of f. Using the four choices of F, we generated four datasets for our main experiments.
For each query, TREC provides the relevance  judgments of the documents.
