We can define average precision loss as ∆map(y, ˆy) = 1 − MAP(rank(y), rank(ˆy)), where rank(y) is a vector of the rank values of each  document in C. For example, for a corpus of two documents, {d1, d2}, with d1 having higher rank than d2, rank(y ) = (1, 0).
In the case of learning a ranked retrieval function, X  denotes a space of queries, and Y the space of (possibly weak) rankings over some corpus of documents C = {d1, .
For instance , with h1 ( q ) , a threshold between documents 1 and 2 gives
