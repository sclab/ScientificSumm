In this paper, we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that maximize MAP performance.
The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea.
Instead, current algorithms tend to take one of two  general approaches.
Performance measures  optimized include accuracy [17, 15], ROCArea [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 21] or modifications of ROCArea [4], and NDCG [2, 3].
Learning a model to optimize for such measures might result in suboptimal MAP performance.
The first approach is to learn a model that estimates the probability
