Due to computational difficulties, few  learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean average precision (MAP), despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems.
In most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant  improvements in MAP scores.
In contrast, we present a general SVM learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of MAP.
Machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked  retrieval systems.
Existing approaches  optimizing MAP either do not find a globally optimal solution, or are computationally expensive.
We evaluate our approach using the TREC 9 and TREC 10
