Our new method makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for Accuracy and ROCArea.
We have shown  empirically that our method is generally superior to or  competitive with conventional SVMs methods.
Since other methods typically require tuning multiple heuristics, we also expect to train fewer models before finding one which achieves good performance.
A natural extension of this framework would be to develop methods to optimize for other important IR  measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain [2, 3, 4, 12] and Mean Reciprocal Rank.
