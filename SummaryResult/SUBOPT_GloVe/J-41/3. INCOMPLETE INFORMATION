Because a RBB auction ranks agents by their true values in  equilibrium for any of these payment rules (by Lemma 1), it follows that expected revenue is the same for all these  payment rules, following arguments that are virtually identical to those used to establish revenue equivalence in the  singleitem case (see e.g.
Using Propositions 1 and 2, it is a simple matter to  derive formulae for the expected revenue under both allocation rules.
Let G ( y ) be the expected resulting clickthrough rate , in a symmetric equilibrium of the RBB auction ( with either payment rule )
