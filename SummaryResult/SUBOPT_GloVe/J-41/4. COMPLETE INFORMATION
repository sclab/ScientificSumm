Since this holds for any two consecutive bidders, it follows that in a Nash equilibrium all bidders must be bidding 0 (since the bidder ranked last matches the bid directly below him, which is 0 by default because there is no such bid).
Since xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for i > j, the system of inequalities in Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the allocation is the result of some Nash equilibrium bid profile.
Indeed we expect that in many cases there will be multiple allocations (and hence equilibria) which satisfy the  conditions of Lemmas 2 and 3.
Finally , the
