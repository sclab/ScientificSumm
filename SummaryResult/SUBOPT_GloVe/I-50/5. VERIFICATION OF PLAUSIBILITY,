Otherwise, remove from M all the states that do not satisfy p (yielding a sparser model M ), and check the CTL formula EÎ³ in M , q with any CTL model-checker.
We follow this idea here, studying the complexity of model checking CTLKP formulae against CTLK models (which can be seen as a compact representation of CTLKP  models in which all the paths are assumed plausible), with the underlying idea that plausibility sets, when needed, must be defined explicitly in the object language.
Other cases: The above cases cover all possible formulas that begin with a path quantifier.
