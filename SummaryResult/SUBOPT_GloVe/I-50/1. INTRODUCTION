In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy  axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models.
We also show how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator, and we study properties of such updates.
We investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, and belief in this new framework.
In this paper , we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior : this notion is added to the language of CTLK [ 19 ] , which is
