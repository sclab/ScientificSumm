In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models.
We use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates.
As a technical device to define the semantics of the resulting logic, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=P that allows to propagate the current set of plausible paths into subformulae.
We would like to stress that we do not see this contribution as a mere technical exercise in formal logic.
We add the new notion of
