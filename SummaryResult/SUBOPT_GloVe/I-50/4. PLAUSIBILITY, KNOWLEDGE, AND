In that case we have Baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ, because the set of states to be considered becomes empty.
The reason lies rather in the fact that we investigate knowledge, beliefs and plausibility in a temporal framework, as Proposition 12 shows.
Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all CTLKP models.
Axioms K, 4, and 5 for beliefs are strongly valid.
The following two theorems characterize the relationship between knowledge and beliefs: first for the class of p-serial models, and then, finally, for all models.
It is easy to see that the axiom
