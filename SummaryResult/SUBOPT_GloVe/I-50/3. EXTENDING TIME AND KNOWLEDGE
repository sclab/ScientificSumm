The idea of defining beliefs is given by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of Ω(q,a); formally, this can be stated as Baϕ ≡ Ka( →a ϕ).
The implementation of temporal plausibility in [7, 8] is based on the interpreted systems approach with time points (r, m) being subject to plausibility.
In consequence, the semantics of Kaϕ can be read as for every run, and every moment on this run that yields the same local state as now, ϕ holds.
Formally , we model
