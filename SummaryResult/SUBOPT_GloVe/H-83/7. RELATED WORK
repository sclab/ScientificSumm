Wang and Dewitt [22] propose a system where the set of web servers that comprise the global domain communicate with each other to compute their respective global  PageRanks.
also experiment within a similar crawling framework in [2], but quantify their results by comparing Kendall"s rank  correlation between the PageRanks of the current set of crawled pages and those of the entire global graph.
Many algorithmic improvements for computing exact  PageRank values have been proposed [9, 10, 14].
However , their experiments differ from our work in that our node selection algorithms do not use ( or have access
