To see this, consider the case in which a node k is added to F to form the augmented local subgraph Fk, and that the PageRank of this new graph is (1 − xk)f xk .
(11) This is in contrast to the simple method outlined in the  previous section, which first iterates over the ( + 1) × ( + 1) matrix PFj to estimate f+ j , and then removes the last  component from the estimate and renormalizes to approximate fj.
( 20 ) If we can compute the function hj in linear time , then we can compute each value of fj
