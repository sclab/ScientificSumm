The PageRank vector r is the dominant eigenvector of the PageRank matrix, r = PU r. We will assume, without loss of generality, that r has an L1-norm of one.
We define the PageRank matrix PU to be: PU = αUD−1 U + (1 − α)veT , (1) where DU is the (unique) diagonal matrix such that UD−1 U is column stochastic, α is a given scalar such that 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, e is the vector of all ones, and v is a non-negative,  L1normalized vector, sometimes called the ‘random surfer"  vector.
In general , each iteration of the power
