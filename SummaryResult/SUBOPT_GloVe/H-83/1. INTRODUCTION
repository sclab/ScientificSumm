In this work, we present a method of approximating the global PageRanks of a local domain while only using resources of the same  order as those needed to compute the PageRanks of the local subgraph.
Our proposed method looks for a supergraph of our local subgraph such that the local PageRanks within this  supergraph are close to the true global PageRanks.
By restricting themselves to smaller, more manageable sections of the web, localized search engines can also provide more precise and complete search capabilities over their respective domains.
Consequently , the computational resources needed to build such a search engine
