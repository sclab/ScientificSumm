One disadvantage such systems have over large-scale search engines is the lack of global PageRank values.
Such  information is needed to assess the value of pages in the localized search domain within the context of the web as a whole.
The algorithms are all highly scalable in that, given a local  domain of size n, they use O(n) resources that include  computation time, bandwidth, and storage.
In this paper, we present well-motivated algorithms to  estimate the global PageRank values of a local domain.
Localized search engines are small-scale systems that index a particular community on the web.
They offer
