As defined in equation ( 1 ) , PG is the PageRank matrix formed from the global graph G , and we define the global PageRank vector of this graph to be g. Let the n-length vector p∗ be the L1-normalized vector corresponding to the global PageRank of the pages in the local domain L : p∗ = EL g ELg 1 , where EL = [ I | 0 ] is the restriction matrix that selects the components from g corresponding to nodes in L. Let p denote the PageRank vector constructed from the local domain subgraph L. In
