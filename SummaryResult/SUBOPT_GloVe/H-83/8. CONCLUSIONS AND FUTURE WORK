The results of such a study can then be analyzed to determine the added benefit of using the global PageRanks computed by our methods, over just using the local PageRanks.
In this work, we contend that the use of global PageRank in a localized search engine can improve performance.
By providing complete and isolated coverage of a particular web domain, localized search engines are an effective outlet to quickly locate  content that could otherwise be difficult to find.
These pages can of course provide valuable information regarding the global PageRank of the local  domain.
In this case , our algorithms
