Note that when xh is an interior point of Oc then the  situation is symmetric for the two agents 1 and 2, and the mediator has the choice of either finding a point on IC1(xh) to  improve the utility of agent 2, or finding a point on IC2(xh) to improve the utility of agent 1.
Under the assumption that the parties" utility functions ui are differentiable concave, the set of all directions of improvement for a party at a point o can be defined in terms of his most preferred, or gradient, direction at that point.
That
