In a negotiation setting, the two typical design goals would be: • Efficiency: Avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal; and • Fairness: Avoid agreements that give the most of the gains to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little.
As the agents hold different objectives and have different capacities, it may be the case that changing between two values of a specific attribute implies different shifts in utility of the agents.
In other words , the presented outcome is Pareto-efficient and should be part of the solution outcome for this
