Assuming that money transfer between agents is possible, the set Att then contains three attributes: • T, taking values from the set {0, 1}, indicates whether the task T is assigned to agent B; • R, taking values from the set of non-negative integer,  indicates the amount of resource R being allocated to agent B; and • MT, taking values from R, indicates the payment p to be transferred from A to B.
Thus , for each agent i , there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular , Raiffa [ 17 ] shows how to
