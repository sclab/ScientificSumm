All of the above mentioned schemes have been applied to data which are non related to each other.
As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time.
The first bucket in each data segment contains a control index, which is a binary index mapping a given key value to the segment containing that key, and a local index, which is an m-entry index mapping a given key value to the buckets within the current segment.
This is based on the
