As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.
This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.
This is in contrast to the exponential scheme where the indexes are of equal sizes.
The example discussed and Algorithm 1 reveals that to access any data , we need to access the major index only once followed by one or
