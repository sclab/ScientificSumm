The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture.
In this paper we have presented a scheme for mapping of wireless broadcast data with their locations.
We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.
We intend to use our LDD scheme and data staging architecture in the pull based architecture.
We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging architecture
