It would be interesting to associate with a node, more than one label (implicitly more than one location) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network (if the network was deployed for target tracking).
6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in  extremely rugged environments.
The hope, and our  original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.
An interesting research direction to pursue could be to
