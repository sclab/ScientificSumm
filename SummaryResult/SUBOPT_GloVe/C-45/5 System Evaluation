It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques.
The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by  Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment.
To estimate the accuracy of our simple model, we plot the number of radio links that exist in the networks, and the number of links that are missing, as functions of the distance between nodes.
