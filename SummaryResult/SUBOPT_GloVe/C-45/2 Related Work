A very recent, remarkable, localization technique is based on radio interferometry, RIPS [13], which utilizes two transmitters to create an interfering signal.
To address these  challenges, and others (hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small range, localization time), several range-free localization schemes have been proposed.
In [2] the  location of a sniper is determined in an urban terrain, by  using the TDoA between an acoustic wave and a radio beacon.
From the  spatiotemporal knowledge for the created events and the temporal information provided by sensor nodes, nodes" spatial  information can be obtained.
