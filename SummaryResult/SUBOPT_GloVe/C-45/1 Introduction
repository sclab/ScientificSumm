To address these challenges, we propose a framework for WSN localization, called StarDust, in which the  complexity associated with the node localization is completely  removed from the sensor node.
The basic principle of the framework is localization through passivity: each sensor node is equipped with a corner-cube retro-reflector and  possibly an optical filter (a coloring device).
We propose a novel framework for node localization in WSNs that is very promising and allows for many future extensions and more accurate results.
Solutions that use the radio transceiver for ranging either have not produced encouraging results ( if the received signal strength
