Note that a static environment was used in each of these experiments, as we wanted to see the performance of the arrival rate and deadline slack on each of the three heuristics.
Similarly, 4 Since our preliminary analysis led is to believe that the number of MAX and EXACTLY ONE CAFs in a task structure have a  minimal effect on the performance of the allocation strategies being evaluated, we set the probabilities of the MAX and EXACTLY ONE CAFs to 0 in order to reduce the combinatorial explosion of the full factorial experimental design.
The breakup of these numbers into
