Table 4 summarizes the results in TDT5SU; adaptive LR was the winner in this case, with relevance feedback on 0.05% of the test documents improving the utility by 20.9% over the results of PRF Rocchio.
Another interesting observation in these results is that the performance of LR did not improve when using a Rocchio prototype as the mean in the prior; instead, the performance decreased in some cases.
From this set of results, we see that LR significantly outperformed Rocchio on all the corpora, even in the runs of standard LR without any tuning, i.e.
