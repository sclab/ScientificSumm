Our main conclusions from this study are the following: • Parameter optimization in AF is an open challenge but has not been thoroughly studied in the past.
For future research we want to study explicit modeling of the temporal trends in topic distributions and content drifting.
• We found Rocchio performs strongly when a good validation corpus is available, and a preferred choice when optimizing Ctrk is the objective, favoring recall over precision to an extreme.
We presented a cross-benchmark evaluation of incremental Rocchio and incremental LR in adaptive filtering , focusing on their robustness in terms of performance consistency
