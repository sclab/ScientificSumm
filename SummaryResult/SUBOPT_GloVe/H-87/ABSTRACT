Relevance feedback on a small portion (0.05~0.2%) of the TDT5 test documents yielded significant performance improvements, measuring up to a 54% reduction in Ctrk and a 20.9% increase in T11SU (with Î²=0.1), compared to the results of the top-performing system in TDT2004 without relevance feedback information.
Using four corpora from the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) forum and the Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity levels, and measured performance with different utility settings.
We found that LR performs strongly and robustly in optimizing T11SU ( a TREC utility function ) while Rocchio
