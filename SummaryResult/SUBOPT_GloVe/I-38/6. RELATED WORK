One approach is given by the algorithms for distributing the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions presented in [7], but these algorithms assume the  computational entities are the items being sold and thus end up with a different type of distribution.
This algorithm also fails to converge to a solution for most cases.
Another  interesting approach is given in [8] where the bidding agents prioritize their bids, thus reducing the set of bids that the centralized winner determination algorithm must consider, making that problem easier.
However , the study of distributed winner determination algorithms for combinatorial auctions is still relatively
