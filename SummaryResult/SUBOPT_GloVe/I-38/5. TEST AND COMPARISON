Notice also that our value generation algorithm (Figure 5) generates a number of bids that is exponential on the number of items, as might be expected in many situations.
The cases where our algorithms failed to arrive at the  distribution of the revenue-maximizing solution are those where there was a large gap between the first and second  valuation for a set (or sets) of items.
We fixed the number of agents to be 5 and we  experimented with different number of items, namely from 2 to 10.
Although the number of nodes expanded by our algorithms increases as function of
