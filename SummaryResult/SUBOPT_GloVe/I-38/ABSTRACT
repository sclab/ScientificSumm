It is an increasing price  combinatorial auction that naturally distributes the problem of  winner determination amongst the bidders in such a way that they have an incentive to perform the calculation.
We have developed a couple of bidding algorithms for the bidders in a PAUSE auction.
In this paper we present our bidding algorithms, discuss their virtues and drawbacks, and compare the  solutions obtained by them to the revenue-maximizing solution found by a centralized winner determination algorithm.
However, most of the existing winner determination algorithms for combinatorial auctions are centralized.
The PAUSE auction is one of a few efforts to
