Ontology matching is currently a key technology to achieve the semantic alignment of ontological entities used by knowledge-based applications, and therefore to enable their interoperability in distributed environments such as  multiagent systems.
In this paper, we present a formal model for a semantic alignment procedure that incrementally aligns differing conceptualisations of two or more agents relative to their respective perception of the environment or domain they are acting in.
It hence makes the situation in which the alignment occurs explicit in the model.
Most ontology matching mechanisms , however , assume matching prior integration and rely on semantics that has
