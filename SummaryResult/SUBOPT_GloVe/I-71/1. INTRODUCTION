In this paper, however, we address the case in which agents are already endowed with a top-down engineered ontology (it can even be the same one), which they do not adapt or refine, but for which they want to find the semantic relationships with separate ontologies of other agents on the grounds of their communication within a specific situation.
Because of these differences there may be a mismatch in the meaning of the syntactic  entities by which agents describe their perceptions (and which constitute the agents" respective ontologies).
The existence of this relationship is precisely justified by the fact
