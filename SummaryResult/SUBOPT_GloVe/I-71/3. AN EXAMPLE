Figure 4: The scenario Robots have a partial view of the domain and there exist two kinds of robots according to the visual field they have.
All robots in the system must be able to solve package distribution problems cooperatively by communicating their intentions to each other.
We assume the reader has all those descriptions in mind.
The only constraint from the above ones that remains plausible according to C2 is : 1, R(Robot2) , 2, UL(Robot1) , 1, C(Package) C2 2, U(Package) Notice that this constraint is an element of the theory of the distributed logic.
