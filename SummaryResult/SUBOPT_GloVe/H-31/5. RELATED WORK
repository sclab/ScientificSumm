[24] studies the parallel derivation of three  different retrieval models which is related to our comparison of Poisson and multinomial.
Poisson distribution has been previously studied in the document generation models [16, 22, 3, 24], leading to the development of one of the most effective retrieval formula BM25 [23].
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study of query generation models based on Poisson distribution.
However, the Poisson model in their paper is still under the document generation  framework, and also does not account for the document length variation.
Once again , none of this work explores
