In Section 2, we introduce the new family of query generation models with Poisson distribution, and present various smoothing  methods which lead to different retrieval functions.
We find that while with some  smoothing methods, the new model and the multinomial model lead to exactly the same formula, with some other  smoothing methods they diverge, and the Poisson model brings in more flexibility for smoothing.
To score a  document, we would first estimate a multivariate Poisson model based on the document, and then score it based on the  likelihood of the query given by the estimated Poisson model.
However , multivariate
