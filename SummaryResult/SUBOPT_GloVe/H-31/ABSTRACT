We show that while in their simplest forms, the new family of models and the existing multinomial models are equivalent, they behave differently for many smoothing methods.
In this paper, we propose and study a new family of query generation models based on Poisson  distribution.
We show that the Poisson model has several  advantages over the multinomial model, including naturally  accommodating per-term smoothing and allowing for more  accurate background modeling.
Most existing models are based on multinomial distribution and would score documents based on query likelihood computed based on a query generation probabilistic model.
We present several variants of the
