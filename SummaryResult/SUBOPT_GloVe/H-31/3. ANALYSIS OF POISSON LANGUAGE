p(·|ˆΛd) is an estimated Poisson  language model for document d. If we have prior knowledge on p(ˆΛd|U), such as which  documents are relevant to the query, we can set πd accordingly, because what we want is to find ∆ that can maximize the likelihood of the query given relevant documents.
For example, a non-discriminative term (e.g., the, is) is expected to be explained more with the background model, while a content term (e.g., retrieval, bush) in the query should be  explained with the document model.
Therefore , a better way of smoothing would be to set the interpolation
