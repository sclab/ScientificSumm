After these investigations, we find that in all the graphs we tested, DiffusionRank (when Î³ = 1) is most robust to  manipulation both in value difference and order difference.
Figure 5 (a) shows that the order difference values change when we add new nodes that point to the  manipulated node.
According to the discussions in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4, we set the iteration number to be MB = 100 in DiffusionRank, and for accuracy consideration, the iteration number in all the algorithms is set to be 100.
We observe that in all the cases , rank values of the manipulated node
