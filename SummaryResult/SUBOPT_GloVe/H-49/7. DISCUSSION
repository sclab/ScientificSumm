Recall that we regard autocorrelation as the degree to which a retrieval satisfies the clustering hypothesis.
It is important before applying this measure to confirm that, given the semantics for some link between two retrieved items, we should expect a correlation between scores. 
Assuming the presence of multiple retrievals is unrealistic in this case.
For example, a system may need to, at retrieval time, assess its performance before deciding to conduct more intensive processing such as pseudo-relevance feedback or interaction.
Similarly , answer candidates in a question-answering task may or may not exhibit autocorrelation ; in this case , the
