As noted above, the poor Clarity performance on web data is consistent with our findings in the detailed  experiments.
Ranking robustness was presented as an  improvement to Clarity for web collections (represented in our  experiments by the terabyte04 and terabyte05 collections),  shifting the Ï„ correlation from 0.139 to 0.150 for terabyte04 and 0.171 to 0.208 for terabyte05.
We begin by examining the situation in column (a) where we are presented with a single retrieval and no information from additional retrievals.
Although the Clarity measure is theoretically designed for language model scores, it consistently underperforms our system-agnostic predictor.
Notice that in
