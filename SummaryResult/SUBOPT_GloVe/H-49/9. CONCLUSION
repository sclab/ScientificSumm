Our  experiments also demonstrate the limits of the usefulness of our predictors when information from multiple runs is provided.
Second, our results could affect the design of minimal test collection algorithms.
To our knowledge, this is the first large scale examination of zero-judgment, single-retrieval  performance prediction.
We have demonstrated this improvement for many, diverse settings.
We believe that these two directions could be  rewarding given the theoretical and experimental evidence in this paper. 
Second, when provided retrievals from other systems, our extended methods demonstrate  competitive performance with state of the art baselines.
First , our results could affect retrieval algorithm
