It is also  different from ranking systems by the average performance on a set of queries.
Given a query, an information retrieval system produces a ranking of documents in the collection encoded as a set of scores associated with documents.
We refer to the set of scores for a particular query-system combination as a  retrieval.
We would like this ranking to approximate the ranking of retrievals by the evaluation measure.
We would like to predict the performance of this retrieval with respect to some evaluation measure (eg, mean average precision).
Scores are often only computed for the top n documents
