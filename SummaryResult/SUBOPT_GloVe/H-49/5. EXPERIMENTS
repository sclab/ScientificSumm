Since we are predicting the performance of retrievals which are not based on language modeling, we use a version of Clarity referred to as ranked-list Clarity [7].
In our tables, we will label results for Clarity using DV KL and the ranking robustness predictor using P. 5.2 Generalizability Experiments Our predictors do not require a particular baseline  retrieval system; the predictors can be computed for an  arbitrary retrieval, regardless of how scores were generated.
Since we are  making a Gaussian assumption about our scores, we can sample scores for these unseen documents from the negative tail of the distribution.
