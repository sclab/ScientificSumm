If, on average over the n documents, the scores of a and Ëœa tend to be very  different, we might suspect that the system is failing on this query.
In this case, we might take a document a, compare its rank in the retrieval to its average rank in the m retrievals.
Here, we can consider the fusion of these retrieval as a surrogate for relevance.
This average corresponds to using the Cox-Lewis statistic to measure the randomness of the top n documents retrieved from a system [18].
Therefore the Cox-Lewis statistic is highly dependent on selecting the top n
