It follows that the expected payment from our mechanism is at most V |Θ|+s|Θ|+(|C|−s)(|Θ|+1) Θ , where s is the number of satisfied clauses.
In any automated mechanism design  setting with an IR constraint, there is a fallback outcome o0 ∈ O where, for any agent i and any type θi ∈ Θi, we have ui(θi, o0) = 0.
Then the utility that the agent derives from the given outcome for this type is 0, and hence, by IR, no payment can be extracted from the agent for this type.
( For if we extracted more from this type
