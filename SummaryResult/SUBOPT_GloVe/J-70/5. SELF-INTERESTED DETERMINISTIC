(This is because we cannot choose the outcome o∗ for such a type, as in this case the agent would have an incentive to report θv instead, where v is the variable satisfying c in the  assignment (so that o(θv) = ol where l occurs in c).)
In this case, we observe that for none of the types, reporting it leads to an outcome ol for a literal l ∈ c, precisely because the clause is not satisfied in the  MINSAT instance.
The final case to check is where the agent '' s type is some θc where c
