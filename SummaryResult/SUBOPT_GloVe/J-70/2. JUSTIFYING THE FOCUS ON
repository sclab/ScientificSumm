This does, however, turn out to be the case: given any mechanism, we can construct a nonmanipulable  mechanism whose performance is identical, as follows.
Since the interface layer acts strategically on each agent"s behalf, there is never an incentive to report falsely to the interface layer; and hence, the types reported by the interface layer are the strategic types that would have been reported  without the interface layer, so the results are exactly as they would have been with the original mechanism.
Given this, we can focus on truthful mechanisms in the rest of the paper.
