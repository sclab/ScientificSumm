All that is left to do is to give the expression the designer is seeking to maximize, which is: • θ1,...,θN γ(θ1, ..., θN )(( o∈O (p(θ1, θ2, ..., θi, ..., θN ))(o)g(o)) + N i=1 πi(θ1, θ2, ..., θN )).
× ΘN , and for every alternative type report ˆθi ∈ Θi, we add the constraint ( o∈O (p(θ1, θ2, .
Finally , for implementation in Bayes-Nash equilibrium , we add the following ( at most NT2 ) constraints to the LP : • For every i ∈ { 1 , 2 , ... , N }
