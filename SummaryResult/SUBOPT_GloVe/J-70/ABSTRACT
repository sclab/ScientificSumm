In this setting, we show that designing optimal deterministic mechanisms is NP-complete in two important special cases: when the center is interested only in the payments made to it, and when payments are not possible and the center is interested only in the outcome chosen.
Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their  preferences truthfully, and a desirable outcome is chosen.
This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization  problem needs to be solved anew each time.
The reason that the agents
