In this setting, we showed that designing an optimal  deterministic mechanism is NP-complete in two important  special cases: when the center is interested only in the payments made to it, and when payments are not possible and the  center is interested only in the outcome chosen.
We also want to study the  complexity of automated mechanism design in settings where the outcome and type spaces have special structure so they can be represented more concisely.
We then showed that allowing randomization in the mechanism makes the design problem in all these settings computationally easy.
Mechanism design is the art of
