We also find that when B asks A to provide context in its first offer, B can require and get more portion of the proceeds because of its goodwill.
According to the three situations above, we make three experiments as follows: Experiment 1 : In this experiment, A and B negotiate with each other for 50 times, and at each time, we assign  different values to dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying dA dB and repA repB) and the reserved utilities of A and B.
A and B get the right to provide context for 20 times and 22 times respectively.
