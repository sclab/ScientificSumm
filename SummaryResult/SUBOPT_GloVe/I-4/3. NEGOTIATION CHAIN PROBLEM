We are not arguing that this statement is a universal valid statement that holds in all situations, but our experimental work shows that the sum of the agents" utilities in the system has been improved by 95% on average when meta-level coordination is used to improve each agent"s local model Ii.
Each agent has a local optimization problem - the multi-linked negotiation problem (represented as an and-or tree), which can be solved using the model and procedures described in Section 2.
The other direction is to find how to allocate time more efficiently for each negotiation in the
