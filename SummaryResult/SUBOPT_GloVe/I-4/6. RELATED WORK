A mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all.
In our work, the negotiation involves more  complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.
Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an  approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the  negotiation chain scenario occurs.
It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization
