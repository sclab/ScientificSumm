The agent can also use this  information to allocate appropriate time for each negotiation, hence to find a good ordering of all related negotiations.
In order to appropriately order and structure the negotiations occurring in the chain so as to  optimize the expected utility, we present an extension to a  singleagent concurrent negotiation framework.
Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the  relationship of flexibility and success probability.
This work is aimed at semi-cooperative multi-agent systems , where each agent has its own goals and works to maximize its
