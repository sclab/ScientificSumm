We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning  mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience.
In future extension of this work, we would like to develop  mechanisms to verify how reliable the agents are.
This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation  solution.
In this paper , we have solved negotiation chain problems by extending our multi-linked negotiation model from the perspective of a single agent to multiple
