If O2 was to inherit the causal relation of Undo(O2), then it would be effectively treated as an operation defined on the  document state with the effects of all three operations O1, O2, and O3, which would prohibit O2 from being transformed against any operation, thus failing to achieve the correct undo effect.
From Definitions 1 and 2, it is clear that the  causaldependency relation is only defined for original operations (e.g.
There are three editing operations in this scenario ( the undo command Undo ( O2 ) and its relation with other operations shall be explained later )
