This has not only resulted in a cleaner and simpler logical structure to the algorithm itself, but also allowed a range of performance optimizations at the  operation buffering level.
In this paper, informal analysis and  simple puzzle scenarios have been used to show the  correctness of COT with respect to various transformation  properties/conditions.
However , these difficulties can be avoided by devising control algorithms ( like COT ) capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties ; it is also easier to prove a control algorithm is capable of breaking the pre-conditions for these properties , than to prove
