The theory of operation context and the COT algorithm shall serve as new  foundations for addressing the technical challenges in existing and emerging OT applications.
The theory of  operation context is capable of capturing essential relationships and conditions for all types of operation in an OT system; it provides a new foundation for better understanding and resolving OT problems.
The COT algorithm provides  uniformed solutions to both consistency maintenance and undo problems; it is simpler and more efficient than prior OT  control algorithms with similar capabilities; and it significantly simplifies the design of transformation functions.
We have contributed the theory
