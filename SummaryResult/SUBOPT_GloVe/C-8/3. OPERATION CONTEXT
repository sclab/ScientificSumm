2 It should be noted that the context-dependency relation is defined only between an original (either normal or inverse) operation and another operation of any type (original or transformed).
When O is an original  normal operation, all operations which are causally before O must be included in C(O) (according to Definition 1 and Definition 5), so CC1 preserves the causal  ordering among original normal operations [4, 22].
3.1 Basic concept Conceptually, each operation O is associated with a  context, denoted by C(O), which corresponds to the document 280 state on which the operation is defined.
To achieve the
