284 There are generally two ways to achieve OT correctness with respect to these transformation properties: one is to design transformation functions capable of preserving these properties; the other is to design control algorithms capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties.
4 There is another Inverse Property 1 (IP1) that is required in an OT system for achieving the correct undo effect [21], but IP1 is not related to IT functions.
IT functions capable of preserving IP2 and IP3 had been devised in the context of ANYUNDO [ 21 ] , but our experience in implementing these functions
