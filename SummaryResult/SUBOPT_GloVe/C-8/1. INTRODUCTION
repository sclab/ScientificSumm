In this paper, we report the main results of this effort: the theory of operation  context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
In Section 4, we present the basic COT  algorithm for supporting consistency maintenance (do) and group undo under the assumption that underlying  transformation functions are able to preserve some important  transformation properties.
After having designed , implemented , and experimented with a series of OT algorithms of increased complexity , we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a uniformed theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems , reducing its complexity ,
