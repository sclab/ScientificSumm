In Step 2, it must be that C(O) = DS (CC3), so O is executed as-is, and the original of O is added to DS (according to Definition 3-Item 2).
After the recursive call to transform(), it must be that C(O) = C(Ox) (CC6), so O is IT-transformed against Ox, and the context of O is updated by adding the original of Ox (according to Definition 4-Item 3).
In COT-UNDO, Undo(O) is interpreted as an inverse O, that is context-dependent on operations in C(O) and O itself.
After the generation of O1 , since C ( O1
