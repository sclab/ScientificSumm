For example, to interpret Undo(O2) in Figure 1,  COTUNDO is invoked with parameters O2 and DS = {O1, O2, O3}.
Then, COT-DO is invoked with parameters O2 and DS.
This is because context-based conditions CC1 - CC6 are uniformly applicable to both  normal and inverse operations.
This example shows that an  inverse operation can be handled by COT-DO in the same way as other normal operations.
COT-UNDO works by first creating an inverse O by  invoking makeInverse(O)2 , with its context C(O) := C(O) âˆª {O} (according to Definition 4-Item 2), and then invoking  COTDO to handle O.
