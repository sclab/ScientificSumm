After having designed, implemented, and experimented with a series of OT algorithms, we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a new  theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems, reducing its complexity, and supporting its continual evolution.
The COT algorithm is not only simpler and more efficient than prior OT control algorithms, but also simplifies the design of transformation functions.
The theoretical foundation for OT is crucial in determining its capability to solve existing and new problems, as well as the quality of those solutions.
In this paper , we report the main results
