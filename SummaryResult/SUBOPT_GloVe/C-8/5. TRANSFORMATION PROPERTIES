Similar to GOTO-ANYUNDO, the basic COT algorithm assumes that underlying transformation functions are  capable of preserving the following properties [4, 15, 19, 23, 21]: 2 The reader is referred to [25] for precise definitions of three primitive operations Insert, Delete and Update and their  corresponding inverses.
Given any operation Ox and a pair of operations [O, O], it must be: IT(IT(Ox, O), O) = IT(Ox, I) = Ox, which means that [O, O] and I are equivalent with  respect to the effect in transformation.
The makeInverse(O) procedure directly  follows these definitions.
COT is a high-level control algorithm responsible
