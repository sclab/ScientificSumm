There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system.
It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.
We mention a few possible extensions here: â€¢ We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.
In addition , we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters
