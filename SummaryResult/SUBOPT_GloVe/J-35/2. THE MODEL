Based on this intuition, it is a relatively straightforward calculation to determine a value of a that depends only on α, β, and δ, but not the number n of players in the system, such that the dominant strategy for all standard agents i is to never volunteer to satisfy any requests (i.e., V t i = 0 for all t).
This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel , so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G ( n
