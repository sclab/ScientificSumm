We compare how many events happen at the locations where the quality is less than the requirement s = 0.6 when each resulting group is conducting surveillance work (We call the  number of such events the failure number of group).
Figure 3 shows the average failure numbers of the resulting groups when different node numbers are set.
Detailed settings of the simulation networks are shown in Table 1.
