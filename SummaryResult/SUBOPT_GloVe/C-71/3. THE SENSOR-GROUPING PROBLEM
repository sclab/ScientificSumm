Based on this notion, to be more reasonable, researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements: Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes: For a point with physical location L, the point is considered covered by the collaboration of i sensors (denoted by k1, ..., ki) if and only if the following two equations holds [7][10][12].
It is a greedy algorithm in which the  priority of selecting a given sensor is determined by how many  uncovered regions this sensor covers and the redundancy caused by this sensor.
We assume that the communication
