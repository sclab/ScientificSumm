(We also tried a proportionality scheme based on both the completion times and maximum concurrency but attained the same results, so only the former scheme"s results are shown here.)
However, we feel that the benefit of finding much higher business value scores justifies the running time of the GA; further we would expect that the running time will improve with both software tuning as well as with a computer faster than our off-the-shelf PC. 
Further , the round-robin scheme produces better results than the random-proportional for a large number of workflows but does not perform as well as
