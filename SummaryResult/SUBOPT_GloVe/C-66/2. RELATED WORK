The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot  simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business  processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later,  optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics).
