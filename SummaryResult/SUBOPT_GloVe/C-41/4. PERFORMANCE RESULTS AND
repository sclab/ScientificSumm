Figure 4 shows that HyARM maintains system utilization close to the desired utilization set point during fluctuation in  input work load by transmitting video of higher (or lower) QoS for QoS-enabled (or best-effort) class of applications during over (or under) utilization of system resources.
The resource utilization of the 10 Mpbs physical link between the base station and the end receiver does not affect QoS of applications and is not monitored by HyARM since it is nearly 10 times the 1 MB bandwidth of the LAN between the UAVs and the base station.
As shown in Figure 4 , when
