In contrast, we treat QoS  requirements such as video frame rate and picture resolution as softer QoS requirements and modify these video properties adaptively to handle dynamic changes in resource  availabil2 Although hard and soft are often portrayed as two discrete requirement sets, in practice they are usually two ends of a continuum ranging from softer to harder rather than two disjoint points.
These  residual resources can be used to increase the QoS of the  applications.
Over-utilization is generally undesirable since the quality of the received video ( such as resolution and frame rate ) and timeliness properties ( such
