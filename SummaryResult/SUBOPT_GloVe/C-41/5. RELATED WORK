These techniques aid in  overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly and result in a rigidly scheduled system that adapts poorly to change.
HyARM can therefore be applied to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of control variables.
The DRE multimedia system as described in Section 2 is an example DRE system that offers both  continuous (picture resolution) and discrete set (frame-rate) of control variables.
The control variables in such systems are therefore intrinsically discrete.
Although existing FCS algorithms have shown promise , these algorithms often assume that the system has continuous
