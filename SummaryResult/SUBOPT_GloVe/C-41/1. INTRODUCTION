In our case study, which involves a distributed real-time video distribution system, the task of adaptive  resource management is to control the utilization of the  different resources, whose utilizations are described by  continuous variables.
We have  implemented HyARM atop The ACE ORB (TAO) [13], which is an implementation of the Real-time CORBA  specification [12].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows : Section 2 describes the architecture , functionality , and resource utilization model of our DRE multimedia system case study ; Section 3 explains the structure and functionality of HyARM ; Section 4 evaluates the adaptive behavior
