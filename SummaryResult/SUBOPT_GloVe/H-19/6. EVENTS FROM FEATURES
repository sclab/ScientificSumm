We define the degree of document overlap  between two features fi and fj as follows.
1 is employed to compute the similarity between two periodic features, Next, we define the overal similarity among a set of  features R using the maximum inter-feature KL-Divergence value as follows.
(1) Since KL-divergence is not symmetric, we define the  similarity between between fi and fj as the maximum of KL(fi|fj ) and KL(fj |fi).
2. fi and fj have a high document overlap.
