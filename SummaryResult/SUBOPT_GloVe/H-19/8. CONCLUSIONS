Future work includes evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news stream, and comparing our model against the closest  equivalent methods, which currently are limited to the methods of Kleinberg [12] (which can only detect certain type of bursty events depending on parameter settings), Fung et al.
For the first time in the area of TDT, we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic events.
To address the real event detection problem, a simple and effective mixture density-based approach was used to identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods.
The key
