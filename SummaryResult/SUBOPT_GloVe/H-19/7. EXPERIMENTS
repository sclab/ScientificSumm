2 such that 1) the number of features span different events, and 2) not all features relevant to an event will be selected, e.g., the feature Clinton is representative to e12 but since Clinton relates to many other events, its time domain signal is far different from those of other representative features like Dole and Bob.
Most features have low S and are easily distinguishable from those features having a much higher S, which allows us to detect important (a)periodic events from trivial events by selecting features with high S. 2.
The GMM model is able to detect and
