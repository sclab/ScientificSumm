The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).
The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3.
( Dominant Power Spectrum ) The dominant power spectrum ( DPS ) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j =
