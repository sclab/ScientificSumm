The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate  multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning  techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.
The difference between this kind of collaborative  agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.
A typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by Caragea et al.
As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge , there have been
