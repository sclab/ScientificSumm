As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter  integration operations (m = k) in both cases.
We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data.
Apart from these obvious performance benefits , integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages : The m-filter operation , for example , decreases the number of learning samples
