Viewing learners as autonomous, self-directed agents is the only appropriate view one can take in modelling these distributed learning environments: the agent metaphor  becomes a necessity as oppossed to preferences for scalability, dynamic data selection, interactivity [13], which can also be achieved through (non-agent) distribution and  parallelisation in principle.
Our hypothesis is a very simple one : If we can devise a sufficiently general , abstract view of describing learning processes , we will be able to utilise the whole range of methods for ( i ) rational reasoning and ( ii ) communication and coordination offered by agent technology
