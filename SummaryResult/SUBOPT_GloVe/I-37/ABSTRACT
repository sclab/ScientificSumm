This paper proposes a framework for agent-based  distributed machine learning and data mining based on (i) the exchange of meta-level descriptions of individual  learning processes among agents and (ii) online reasoning about learning success and learning progress by learning agents.
This allows us to apply existing agent  interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.
We apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which
