We complement this existence theorem with a general framework to design such a payment scheme P. Furthermore, we present general techniques to compute the payment when the output is a composition of the outputs of subgames through the operators or and and; through round-based combinations; or through intermediate results, which may be themselves computed from other subproblems.
A framework is then proposed in Section 4 to compute the payment P in  polynomial time for several types of allocation rules O.
As shown in this paper , the MAX and IF-THEN-ELSE combinations are special cases of the composition-based techniques that we
