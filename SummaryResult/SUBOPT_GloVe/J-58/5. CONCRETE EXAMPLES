5: r = r + 1 6: Output R. Let GSC(S) be the sets selected by the Algorithm 7.Notice that the output set is a function of S and c. Some works assume that the type of an agent could be ci, i.e., Si is assumed to be a  public knowledge.
Thus, for every round, it satisfies MP and the cut value is |Si|1/2 Â· ajr |Sjr |1/2 where jr is the bidder selected in round r if we did not consider the agent i at all.
Thus , for an agent i , we first focus on the output of
