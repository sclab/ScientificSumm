Coping with bandwidth  variations, heterogeneity and asymmetry are particularly  important in design of peer-to-peer overlay for streaming  applications because delivered quality to each peer is directly determined by its bandwidth connectivity to (other peer(s) on) the overlay.
Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet, any approach for constructing  overlay should address the following fundamental challenges: (i) Scalability with the number of participating peers, (ii)  Robustness to dynamics of peer participation, (iii) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth, and (iv)  Accommodating heterogeneity and asymmetry of bandwidth connectivity among participating peers[19].
In our earlier work , we developed
