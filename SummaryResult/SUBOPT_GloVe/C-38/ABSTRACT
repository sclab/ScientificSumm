PRO is designed for non-interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to  maximize delivered bandwidth (and thus delivered quality) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth.
Independent parent selection by individual peers  dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure.
To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own  delivered bandwidth.
Furthermore , each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents
