This is a starting point for our work on PRO.
PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to  maximize its performance.
Both peer discovery and peer selection in this framework are scalable.
We are currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via simulation, and exploring the design space of key  components.
Furthermore, PRO uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions to properly reshape the structure.
We are also prototyping this framework to conduct
