Given the  available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that  contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path  diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.
The PS mechanism at each peer is essentially a progressive search within the local image for a subset of parent peers
