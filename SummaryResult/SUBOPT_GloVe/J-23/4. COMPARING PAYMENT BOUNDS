If we have to respect the inequalities in (1), we have to set bAB = bCD = 0, bBC = 1, so NTUmax(c) = 1.
Again, consider the graph of Figure 1.
By condition (3), both of these  inequalities must be tight (the former one is the only inequality  involving bAB, and the latter one is the only inequality involving bCD).
Otherwise, we can set bAB = bCD = 1, bBC = 0, so TUmax(c) â‰¥ 2.
On the other hand, if the goal is to minimise bAB + bBC + bCD, one should set bAB = bCD = 0, bBC = 1, so NTUmin(c) = 1.
This construction is
