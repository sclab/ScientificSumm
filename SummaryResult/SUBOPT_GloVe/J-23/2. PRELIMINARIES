Given a monotone allocation rule A and a bid vector b, the threshold bid te of an agent e âˆˆ A(b) is the highest bid of this agent that still wins the auction, given that the bids of other participants remain the same.

A set system is a pair ( E , F ) , where E is the ground set , |E| = n , and F is a collection of feasible sets , which are subsets
