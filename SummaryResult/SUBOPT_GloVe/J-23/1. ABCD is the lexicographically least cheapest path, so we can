For NTUmax(c), there is an additional constraint bX0 ≥ 1, so the best we can do is to set bXi = 0 for i = 1, .
For any n ≥ 3 , we can construct an instance of the vertex cover problem on a graph of size n that satisfies NTUmin ( c ) /TUmin ( c ) ≥ n − 2. j+2ix ij P \ P ij+2P \ P yijixix j j+1 i j+2ij+1 y y i i j+2ie j e j+1 e ij+1 P \ P Figure 3 : Proof of Theorem 3 : constraints for ˆPij and ˆPij+2
