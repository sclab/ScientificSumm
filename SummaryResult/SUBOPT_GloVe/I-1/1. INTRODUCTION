A key feature of our procedure-based approach is that we allow each plan to execute some particular code on a failure and on an abort.
Failures can occur for a number of reasons, and it is often not possible to predict these in advance, either because of the complexity of the system or  because changes in the environment invalidate some earlier decisions.
Besides dealing with failure, an important capability of an  intelligent agent is to be able to abort a particular task or plan.
We show how aborts can be smoothly introduced into a BDI-style architecture , and for the
