We are planning to implement an instance of our approach in the SPARK agent system [9]; in particular, the work of this paper will be the basis for SPARK"s abort handling mechanism.
Related to this is determining the cost of aborting a task or plan, and using this as an input to the deliberation process.
A further item of interest is extending our approach to failure and abort to maintenance goals [1].
Future work is to place our approach in service of more dynamic agent reasoning , such as the introspection that an agent capable of reasoning over
