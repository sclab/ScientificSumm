Here Pmaxprice is a distribution over just the maximum price of the day, and we then examine worst-case sequences  consistent with this price (seq(p) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market sequences satisfying max1≤t≤T pt = p).
In the remaining, we assume that Q is a power of 2 and the base of the logarithm is 2.
In the volume distribution model, we assume only that there exists a distribution Pvol over the total volume V traded in the market for the day, and then  examine the worst-case competitive ratio over sequences  consistent with the randomly chosen volume.
We
