(Sketch of Theorem 3) W.l.o.g., assume that Q = 1 and the total volume is V .
(Sketch of Theorem 10) We use the idea of  guessing the total volume from Theorem 1, but now allow for the possibility of an arbitrary (but known) distribution over the total volume.
( Sketch of Theorem 4 ) The algorithm simply sells ut = ( vt/Vmin ) N shares at time t. The total number of shares sold U is clearly more than N and U = t ut = t ( vt/Vmin ) N = ( V/Vmin ) N â‰¤ QN The average price
