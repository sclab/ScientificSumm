It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q, we can in fact achieve a VWAP competitive ratio of 1.
In contrast to the VWAP , another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading ( OWT ) competitive ratio [ 3 ] with respect to a set of sequences Σ : ROWT ( A ) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T { pt/VWAPA ( S ) } where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both
