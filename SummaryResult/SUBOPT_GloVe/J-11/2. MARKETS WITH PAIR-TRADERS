Allowing such equilibria with crossing bids we can find the minimum profit a trader or set of traders can make, by minimizing the value yt (or sum P t∈T yt) over all optimal  solutions that satisfy pi = 0 whenever i is connected to only a single trader.
Consider any agent i that is only connected to a single trader t. Because the agent is only connected to a single trader , the variables yt and pi are dual variables corresponding to the same primal inequality xt ≤ 1 , and they always appear together as yt + pi in all
