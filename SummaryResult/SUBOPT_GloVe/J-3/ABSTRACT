In this work, we focus on the advertisers, who must solve a complex optimization problem to decide how to place bids on  keywords to maximize their return (the number of user clicks on their ads) for a given budget.
We model the entire process and study this budget optimization problem.
We also present inapproximability results, and optimal algorithms for  variants of the budget optimization problem.
While there has been previous work on the auction process and its game-theoretic aspects, most of it focuses on the Internet company.
While most variants are NP-hard , we show , perhaps surprisingly , that
