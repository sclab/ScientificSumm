4.3 A (1 − 1 e )-approximation algorithm The key to the proof of Theorem 3 is to show that there is a distribution over single-bid strategies from Lemma 4 that obtains at least (1 − 1 e )CΩ clicks.
To calculate the spend of this strategy consider two cases: if u = 0 then we are bidding h(v) with probability pv = α/v.
Using this set of uniform strategies as constraints , we can characterize a set of worst-case click-price curves by the constraints Z CΩ 0 h ( r ) dr ≤ U ∀ ( u , v )
