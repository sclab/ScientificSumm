If the graph G has the laminar property, then, by applying Lemma 11, the dynamic programming recurrence in (5), and Lemma 9, we can find an optimal solution to the Budget Optimization problem in O(B3 U3 n) time.
Furthermore, G has at most twice as many nodes as G. Given a graph with at most two children per node, we  define F[i, b, U] to be the maximum number of clicks achievable by bidding at least b on each of keywords j s.t.
In addition, we can apply Lemma 9 to compute the  optimal (randomized) solution.
We can
