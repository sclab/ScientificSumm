But, the equation above shows that each piece has its  incremental cpc equal to the bid that achieves it; thus in the case of VCG the pieces are also sorted by bid.
Now consider running the algorithm described in  Section 2.1.4 for finding the optimal bids for a set of queries.
The slope of line segment between the points corresponding to those two positions is cost(b[i]) − cost(b[i + 1]) clicks(b[i]) − clicks(b[i + 1]) = (α[i] − α[i + 1]) · b[i] α[i] − α[i + 1] = b[i].
