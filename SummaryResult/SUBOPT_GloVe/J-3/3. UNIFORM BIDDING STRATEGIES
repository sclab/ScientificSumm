Given an instance of Budget Optimization in which there are a total of N points in all the landscapes, we can find the best uniform strategy in O(N log N) time.
For any possible bid b, if we use the aggregate landscape just as we would a regular landscape, we exactly represent the cost and clicks associated with making that bid  simultaneously on all queries associated with the aggregate  landscape.
Output the strategy which is the appropriate convex combination of the uniform bid vectors corresponding to α and β.
Suppose we have a set of queries Q , where
