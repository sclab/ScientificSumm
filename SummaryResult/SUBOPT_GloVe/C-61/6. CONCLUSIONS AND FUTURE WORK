Also, since so much trust is put into the clients of our  architecture, it will be necessary to integrate into the  architecture many of the cheat detection schemes that have been proposed in the literature.
As discussed earlier, this will allow for a more efficient and responsive game in certain situations and alleviate some of the processing load from the server.
In this paper , we first proposed a proxy-based architecture for MMOGs that enables MMOGs to scale to a large number of users by mitigating the need for a large number of transport sessions to be maintained and decreasing
