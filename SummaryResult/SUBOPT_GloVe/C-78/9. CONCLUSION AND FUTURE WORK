The paper presented the general model of a sentient  object to describe composition, encapsulation and interaction in such an environment and developed the Generic Event  Architecture GEAR which integrates the interaction through the environment and the network.
To reduce network traffic and only disseminate those events to the  subscribers which they are really interested in and which have a chance to arrive timely, the encapsulation and scoping schemes have to be transformed into respective multi-level filtering rules.
While appropriate  abstractions and interaction models can hide the functional heterogeneity of the networks, it is impossible to hide the quality differences.
Therefore
