The paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on events-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the  system.
A crucial design decision is the choice of the appropriate abstractions and interaction mechanisms.
To a large extent, such systems operate proactively and independently of direct  human control driven by the perception of the environment and the ability to organize respective computations dynamically.
the interactions through the environment.
Looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical components , hardware and
