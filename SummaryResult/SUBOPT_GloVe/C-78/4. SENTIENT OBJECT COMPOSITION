On the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a  certain CAN.
From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments.
Therefore, it should be  possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient  objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.
In the above example , a vehicle may be a
