A key advantage of this architecture is that event-messages and physical events can be globally ordered, if necessary, since they all pass through the event layer.
If they are of concern to a remote smart actuator, they are disseminated through the distributed event layer, to reach the former.
Inside a body there may also be implicit knowledge , which can be exploited to make interaction more efficient , like the knowledge about the number of cooperating entities , the existence of a specific communication network or the simple fact that all components are co-located and thus the respective events do
