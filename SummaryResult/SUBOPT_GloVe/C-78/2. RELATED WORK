Such a central component is not available in an infrastructure envisaged in our system architecture and the developed middleware TAO (The Ace Orb) is quite complex and unsuitable to be directly integrated in smart devices.
Smart transducers are organized in clusters that are  connected to a CORBA system by a gateway.
They are targeted for the CAN-Bus [9], a popular  network developed for the automotive industry.
Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously  defined, no model to specify temporal properties for  clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 
However , in contrast to the event channel model
