In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of  communication through the environment.
As mentioned above, a  fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and  interact with it.
We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of  information while interacting with sentient objects.
Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.
We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and
