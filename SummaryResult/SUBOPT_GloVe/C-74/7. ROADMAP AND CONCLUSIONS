We are currently working on algorithms and protocols that,  exploiting probabilistic and statistical techniques on the basis of small amounts of exchanged information, are able to  improve considerably the efficiency in terms of resources  (memory, bandwidth, etc) and the reliability of our middleware platform [13].
One futuristic research development, which may take these ideas of adaptation of messaging middleware for mobile  environments further is the introduction of more mobility  oriented communication extensions, for instance the support of geocast (i.e., the ability to send messages to specific  geographical areas). 
We have described and discussed the characteristics and differences of our solution
