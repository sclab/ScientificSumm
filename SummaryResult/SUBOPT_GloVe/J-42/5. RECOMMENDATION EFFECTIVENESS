We observe marked differences in the response to  recommendation for different categories of books.
On average, only 2% of the  recommenders of a book received a discount because their  recommendation was accepted, and another 1% made a  recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount.
In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that  accompanies this hobby.
In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower  recommendation effectiveness.
