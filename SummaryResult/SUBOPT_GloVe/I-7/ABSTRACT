On this basis, we investigate for different commitment types whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later, and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to backward induction and Pareto efficiency.
In some, a player can only commit to the performance of an  action, in others, he can commit himself conditionally on the actions of the other players.
Central to our analyses is the notion of an extortion , which we define , for a given order of the players , as a profile that contains , for each player , an optimal commitment given the commitments of
