Also, commitments have played a  significant role in the theory of equilibrium selection (see, e.g., [13].
Thus, Conitzer and Sandholm [2] have studied the computational complexity of computing the optimal strategy to commit to in normal form and Bayesian games.
Commitments have by no means gone unnoticed (see, ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 3) (3, 2) (0, 0) (2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 1: Committing to a dominated strategy can be  advantageous.
We, however, consider a number of different commitment types, among which conditional commitments, and propose a generic solution concept. 
The possibility to make commitments distinguishes cooperative from noncooperative game theory
