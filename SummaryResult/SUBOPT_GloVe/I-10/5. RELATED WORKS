on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 6: Accuracies of two asynchronous 11-MAS (1/33ms−1 and 1/16ms−1 example rates) . 
In [11] the MAS performs a form of ensemble learning in which the agents are lazy learners (no explicit representation is  maintained) and sell useless examples to other agents.
In mutual online concept  learning [14] the agents converge to a unique hypothesis, but each agent produces examples from its own concept  representation, thus resulting in a kind of synchronization rather than in pure concept learning.
In [ 10 ] each agent observes all the examples but only perceive a part
