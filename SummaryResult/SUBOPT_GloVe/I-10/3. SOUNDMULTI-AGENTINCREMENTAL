The lgg operator is defined by considering examples as terms, so we denote as lgg(e) the most specific term that covers e, and as lgg(h, e) the most specific term which is more general than h and that covers e. Restricting the term to lgg is the basis of a lot of Bottom-Up learning algorithms (for instance [5]).
Following proposition 1 this mechanism can be used to produce a strong mas-consistent mechanism : upon reception of a new example in the MAS by an agent r , an update is possibly needed and , after a set of
