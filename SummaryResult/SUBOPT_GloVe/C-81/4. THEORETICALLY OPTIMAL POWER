In view of the above models for the system components and the required performance, the objective of our power management strategy is adjust the duty cycle D(i) dynamically so as to maximize the total utility U(D) over a period of time, while ensuring energy neutral operation for the sensor node.
For the calculation of the optimal strategy, we assume complete knowledge of the energy availability profile at the node, including the availability in the future.
Further , the battery level can not be negative at any time , and this is ensured by having a large enough initial
