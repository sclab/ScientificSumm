Energy supply has always been a crucial issue in designing battery-powered wireless sensor networks because the lifetime and utility of the systems are limited by how long the batteries are able to sustain the operation.
Thus, power management methods based on battery status are not always applicable to energy harvesting systems.
Alternatively, a common performance scaling technique is duty cycling.
Second, there is an uncertainty associated with its availability and measurement, compared to the energy stored in the battery which can be known deterministically.
In this paper , we will study how to adapt the performance of the available energy
