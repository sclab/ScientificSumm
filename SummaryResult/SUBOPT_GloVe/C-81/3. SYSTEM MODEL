In other words, the system should only use as much energy as harvested from the environment and attempt to maximize performance within this available energy budget. 
Collecting this information requires that the node hardware be equipped with the facility to measure the power generated from the environment, and the Heliomote platform [14] we used for evaluating the algorithms has this capability.
It may be noted that for low power systems with more advanced capabilities such as dynamic voltage scaling ( DVS ) , multiple low power modes , and the capability to shut down system components selectively , the power
