We measure this by the percentage of queries that are actually stemmed, over all the queries that could possibly be stemmed.
Since we only care how much we can improve the naive model, we will only use these 408 queries (all the queries that are affected by the naive stemming model) in the experiments.
Considering the tight upper-bound 2 on the improvement to be gained from pluralization handling (via the oracle model), the current performance on short queries is very  satisfying.
This model makes the same stemming as the naive model on the query side , but performs conservative matching
