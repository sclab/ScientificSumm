Our approach is unique in that it performs predictive stemming on a per query basis without relevance feedback from the Web, using the context of the variants in documents to preserve precision.
However, the effectiveness of  stemming for English query systems was previously reported to be rather limited.
We use a similar corpus based approach for stemming by computing the similarity between two words based on their distributional context  features which can be more than just adjacent words [15], and then only keep the morphologically similar words as  candidates.
