To test whether an expansion is useful, we have to know whether the expanded query is likely to get more relevant documents from the Web, which can be quantified by the probability of the query occurring as a string on the Web.
The rationale of using distributional word similarity is that true variants tend to be used in similar contexts.
Considering the fact that queries and documents may not represent the intent in exactly the same way, we relax this proximity constraint to allow variant occurrences within a window of some fixed size.
On the other hand , if the
