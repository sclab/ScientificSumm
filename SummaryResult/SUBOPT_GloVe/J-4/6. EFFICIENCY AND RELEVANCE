We would expect efficiency to be maximized at q = 1, since in this case a bidder"s weight is exactly his relevance.
Perform an exchange sort to obtain the ranking that arises with q + starting from the ranking that arises with q (for a description of exchange sort and its properties, see Knuth [6] pp.
Proposition 2 confirms that efficiency is indeed maximized at q = 1.
As we see total value can be reinterpreted as total profits to the bidders and auctioneer combined.
Agents s and t , where s is initially ranked lower than t , are swapped
