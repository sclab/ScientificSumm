It then follows from (7) that q = 0 will yield more revenue in equilibrium than q = 1.5 5 It may appear that this contradicts the revenue-equivalence theorem [7, 9], because mechanisms that always lead to the same allocation in equilibrium should yield the same  revenue.
However, unlike in the incomplete information setting, here we are constrained to ranking rules that correspond to a certain weighting scheme ws â‰¡ g(es).
We do not consider weights that also depend on the agents '' bids because this would invalidate the equilibrium analysis of the previous section.4 A pool of N bidders is
