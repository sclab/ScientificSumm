always at most 0.08, and usually significantly less, over  different days in a period of two weeks.6 We fit a lognormal distribution to the lower bounds on the bidders" values,  resulting in parameters μ = 0.35 and σ = 0.71.
We used a Gaussian copula to create dependence between value and relevance.7 Given the marginal distributions for value and relevance together with this copula, we simulated the revenue effect of varying q for different levels of  Spearman correlation, with 12 slots and 13 bidders.
Figure 2 also shows that in principle, the optimal q may be negative.
