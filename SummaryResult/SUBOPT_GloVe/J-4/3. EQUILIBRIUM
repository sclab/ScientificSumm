(5) To summarize, the minimum possible revenue in symmetric equilibrium can be computed as follows, given the agents" relevance-value pairs (es, vs): first rank the agents in  decreasing order of wsvs, and then evaluate (5).
The base case of the  recursion occurs for s = K, where we find that the first excluded bidder bids his true value, as in the original analysis.
In this work we assume that bidders are playing the smallest symmetric equilibrium.
This is a full-information concept.
Let K ( r ) be the number of bidders with wsvs â‰¥ r , and assume it is
