This equilibrium consists of the following choices: first a proposes P3 ; player 1 rejects this offer; a proposes then P2 and both players 1 and 2 accepts otherwise they are threatened to  receive the worse offer P1 for them.
We also have the following notation: δk is the  threshold decrease factor of player k, Φk : Pk → Xk is player k"s function to convert a proposal to an option and Ψk is the function indicating which points P has to be improved, with Ψk its dual function - on which points no  improvement is necessary.
Therefore , our cooperation-based
