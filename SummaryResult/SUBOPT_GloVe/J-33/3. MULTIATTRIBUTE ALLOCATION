Let MMPd (b, s) denote a modified version of MMP, where OT b and OT s are extended to assume divisibility (i.e., the offer sets are taken to be their closures under Definition 1).
Divisibility, linear pricing, and configuration parity  (Definitions 1, 10, and 9), with combination offer set defined as the minimal set consistent with configuration aggregation  (Definition 6).2 Then the solution to GMAP consists of a set of trades, each of which employs a configuration that solves MMP for its specified pair of traders.
Suppose agents b and s exhibit configuration parity , divisibility , and linear
