Agent i"s willingness to pay for quantity q of configuration x in the  context of other trades T is given by ˆuB i (x, q; T) = max π s.t.
Suppose agent i offers, in the same context, the same quantity of two (not necessarily different) configurations, x and x .
Suppose a  particular trade is offered in the same context (set of additional trades, T) with two different sellers, s and s .
For a set of trades T, we denote by Ti that subset of T involving agent i (i.e., b = i or s = i).
For example , one
