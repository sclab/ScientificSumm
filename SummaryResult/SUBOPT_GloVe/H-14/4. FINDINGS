Our findings also show that our subjects felt that QueryDestination produced more relevant and useful suggestions for exploratory tasks than the other systems.11 All other observed differences between the systems were not statistically significant.12 The difference between performance of QueryDestination and SessionDestination is explained by the approach used to generate destinations (described in Section 2).
Given that there was no difference in the tasks attempted on each system, theoretically the perception of the tasks" simplicity, clarity, and familiarity should have been the same for all systems.
Subjects found the search easier on QuerySuggestion and QueryDestination than the other systems
