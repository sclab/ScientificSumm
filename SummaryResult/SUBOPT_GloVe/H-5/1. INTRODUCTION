To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.
Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.
Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations , which have relevance judgments at
