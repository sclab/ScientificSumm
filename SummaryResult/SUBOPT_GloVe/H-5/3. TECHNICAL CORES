Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user.
For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.
Based on a training set of labeled instances , it learns a class model which can then by used to
