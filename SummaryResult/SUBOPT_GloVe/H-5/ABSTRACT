It combines the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive filtering, novelty detection and non-redundant passage ranking with respect to long-lasting information needs (â€˜tasks" with multiple queries).
We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty.
This paper examines a new approach to information  distillation over temporally ordered documents, and proposes a novel evaluation scheme for such a framework.
Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.
Our approach supports
