The algorithm also solves instances with traditional pseudotree arrangements  using the same procedure as DPOP.
We prove that for some  problem instances it is not possible to generate a traditional pseudotree using edge-traversal heuristics that will outperform a cross-edged pseudotree.
We use multiple heuristics to generate pseudotrees and choose the best pseudotree in linear space-time complexity.
We compare our algorithm with DPOP using several metrics  including the induced width of the pseudotrees, the maximum  dimensionality of messages and computation, and the maximum  sequential path cost through the algorithm.
Several current algorithms that solve general DCOP instances , including ADOPT and
