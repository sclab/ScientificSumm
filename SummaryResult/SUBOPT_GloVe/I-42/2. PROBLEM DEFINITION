We define an edge-traversal based method as any method that produces a pseudotree in which all parent/child pairs share an edge in the original graph.
Also defined in [ 6 ] are four types of relationships between nodes exist in a pseudotree : • P ( X ) - the parent of a node X : the single node higher in the pseudotree that is connected to X directly through a tree edge • C ( X ) - the children of a node X : the set of nodes lower in the pseudotree that are connected to X directly
