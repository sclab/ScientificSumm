This extension to the original DisCSP approach has become popular in multi-agent systems, and has been labeled the Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) [1].
We discuss the complexity of our algorithm as well as the impact of pseudotree generation  heuristics.
In this paper we introduce an extension to the DPOP algorithm that handles an extended set of pseudotree arrangements which include cross-edged pseudotrees.
Current algorithms that solve complete DCOPs use two main approaches: search and dynamic programming.
Instead of finding an assignment that satisfies all constraints, these approaches find an assignment that produces a high level of global utility.
