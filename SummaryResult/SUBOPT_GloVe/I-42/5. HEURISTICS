The root then broadcasts the total complexity for that heuristic to all nodes.
We consider only heuristics that run in polynomial time with  respect to the number of nodes in the original DCOP instance.
Improved DFS based heuristics use a special procedure to choose the root node, and also provide an ordering function over the neighbors of a node to determine the order of path recursion.
Each node then proceeds to begin the DCPOP algorithm using its  knowledge of the pseudotree generated by the best heuristic.
In our experiments we used several evaluation functions that took as arguments an ordered
