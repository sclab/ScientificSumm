However, given the special form of the  securities in the subset betting market, we can show that the matching problems for divisible orders can be solved in  polynomial time.
( 4 ) asks whether there is a state or permutation s in which the profit is less than c , and can be rewritten as i Ii ( s ) qixi < i biqixi − c ∀s ∈ S. ( 5 ) Thus it suffices to show how to find efficiently a state s satisfying the above inequality ( 5 ) or verify that the opposite inequality holds for all
