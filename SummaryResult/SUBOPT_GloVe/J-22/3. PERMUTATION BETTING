Assuming qe = 1 for all e, this is a cycle C with a total of |C| edges such that the worst-case profit for the auctioneer is e∈C be − (|C| − 1) ≥ 0, since in the worst-case state the auctioneer needs to pay $,1 to every order in the cycle except one.
(1) Similarly we can define the existence of a match with  divisible orders.
Again the order can be either indivisible or divisible and the auctioneer needs to decide what fraction xi of each order to accept so as not to incur any loss , with A B
