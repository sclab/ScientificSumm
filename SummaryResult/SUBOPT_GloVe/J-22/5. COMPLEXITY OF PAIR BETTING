It takes polynomial time to find a cycle in an order graph G(V, E) that has the highest worst-case profit, that is max C∈C e∈C be − (|C| − 1) , where C is the set of all cycles in G. Proof.
Given the optimal set of partial orders to accept for G when edge weights are (1 − ), if we can calculate the optimal worst-case profit, by lemma 9 we can solve the unweighted minimum feedback arc set problem on G, which is NP-hard.
