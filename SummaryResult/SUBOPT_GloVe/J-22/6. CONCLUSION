Interesting open questions for our permutation betting  include the computational complexity of optimal indivisible matching for subset betting and the necessary condition for the existence of a match in pair betting markets.
We are interested in further exploring better approximation  algorithms for pair betting markets. 
We find that in a subset betting  market an auctioneer can find the optimal set and quantity of orders to accept such that his worst-case profit is maximized in polynomial time if orders are divisible.
While it is  unnatural and intractable to allow traders to bet directly on the n!
We prove that the optimal
