Since [9] this search has led to improved understanding of the nature of the  optimal auction, the techniques for on-the-fly pricing in these  scenarios, and the competitive ratio of the optimal auction [5, 7, 8].
The results of this paper are as follows: â€¢ We give the auction for three units that is optimally  competitive against the profit of the omniscient single priced  mechanism that sells at least two units.
For the three-unit case where we have shown that the lower bound of [8] is tight, this  observation led to our construction of the optimal three-unit auction. 
Positive results in
