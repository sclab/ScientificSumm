For any particular k and H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, .
(4) In order to lower bound Pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ kh], consider the auction that minimizes it and is consistent with the lower bounds obtained by the strong inductive hypothesis on Pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ ih].
As this 180 lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge a sales price higher than any bid in the input.
( 3 ) Equation ( 1 ) follows from the conservatism of
