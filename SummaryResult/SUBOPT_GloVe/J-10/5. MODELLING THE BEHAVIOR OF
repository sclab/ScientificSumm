The value of δf may depend on various factors; we fix one value for each feature f; • c is a constant between 1 and 5; • wi f is the weight of feature f in the textual comment of review i, computed according to Eq.
vi f is assumed normally distributed around some value vf ; • δf ∈ [0, 1] can be seen as a measure of the bias when reporting feedback.
