We show that this is inevitable by constructing a family of graphical games on bounded-degree trees for which best response policies of some of the vertices have exponential size, and any  twopass algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that is similar in spirit to that of [8]) has to store almost all points of the best response policies.
The first of these papers describes a generic algorithm for this problem that can be specialized in two ways : as an algorithm that computes approximations to all Nash equilibria in time polynomial in the input size and the approximation quality , or as
