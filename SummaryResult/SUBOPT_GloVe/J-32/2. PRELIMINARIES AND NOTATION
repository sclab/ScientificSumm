When a node V is instructed by its parent to adopt mixed strategy v, it does the  following for each child U - It finds a pair (v, u) âˆˆ B(V, U) (with the same v value that it was given by its parent) and instructs U to play u. 
Suppose that (V, W ) is an edge of the tree, that v is a mixed strategy for V and that w is a mixed strategy for W .
Each vertex has two actions, which are denoted by 0 and 1.
Given an edge ( V , W ) of the tree
