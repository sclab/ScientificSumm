For an odd-length cycle all other vj "s are derivable from those solutions, and if a fully mixed Nash equilibrium exists, all the vj should turn out to be real numbers in the range (0, 1).
For the second search, note that if Vi plays a mixed strategy, then vi+1 and vi−1 satisfy an equation of the form vi+1 = (A0 + A1vi−1)/(B0 + B1vi−1).
The values for vi that may occur in a Nash equilibrium are those for which all dependent vj values lie in ( 0 , 1 ) ; the latter condition is easy to check by computing
