It has recently been shown that the problem of finding Nash equilibria in a general degree-3 graphical game with two actions per player is complete for the complexity class PPAD, indicating that it is unlikely that there is any polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.
This setting was first considered by Kearns, Littman and Singh, who  proposed a dynamic programming-based algorithm that computes all Nash equilibria of such games.
It is an open question whether our algorithm runs in polynomial time on graphs with pathwidth 1 , but we show that finding a Nash equilibrium for a 2-action graphical game in
