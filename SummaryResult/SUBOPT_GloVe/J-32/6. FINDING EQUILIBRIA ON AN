As in previous section, we can show that B(W, V ) is equal to ˆf(0) ∪ ˆf(B(V, U1) × · · · × B(V, Uk)) ∪ ˆf(1) [0, 1]2 ; also, any path from w = 0 to w = 1 that is a subset of B(W, V ) constitutes a valid breakpoint policy.
Recall that the payoffs of a  vertex with k + 1 neighbours are described by matrices P0 and P1 , where Pj i0i1...ik is the payoff that V gets when it plays j, and its neighbours play i0, .
Since f is a continuous
