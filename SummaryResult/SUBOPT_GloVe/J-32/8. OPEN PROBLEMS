Hence, one can think of constructing B(Vk+1, Vk) as the  following process: turn B(Vk, Vk−1) by π/2, cut it along the (now horizontal) line vk = α, apply a fractional linear transform to the horizontal coordinate of both parts, and reconnect them using the image of the segment {α}×[0, 1] under f. This implies that the problem of bounding the size of the best response policy (or,  alternatively, the breakpoint policy), can be viewed as a generalization of the following computational geometry problem, which we  believe may be of independent interest: PROBLEM 1.
