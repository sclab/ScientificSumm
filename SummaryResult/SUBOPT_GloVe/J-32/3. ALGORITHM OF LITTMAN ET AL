In the downward pass, the chosen values are w = .1, then, from the trimming, v = 0 and u = 1, which is not a Nash equilibrium since W prefers action 1.
We will show later that a sufficient condition for the construction of such a data structure is the invariant that, at every level of the upstream pass, Ë†B(W, V ) contains a continuous path from w = 0 to w = 1.
The best response policy for V is not a breakpoint policy (because of how the curve from w = 0 to w = 1 doubles back).
This can be achieved if ,
