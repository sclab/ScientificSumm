Large scale publish/subscribe systems are likely to employ  components of the event transport network owned by cooperating, but independent organisations.
This paper extends previous work to present and evaluate a secure multi-domain publish/subscribe  infrastructure that supports and enforces fine-grained access control over the individual attributes of event types.
We show that our approach has a smaller overall  communication overhead than existing approaches for achieving the same degree of control over security in publish/subscribe networks.
As the number of  participants in the network increases, security becomes an  increasing concern.
We demonstrate that the time and space overheads can be minimised by
