The difference in performance with event encryption and attribute  encryption with only one attribute is caused by the Java object serialisation mechanism: in the event encryption case the whole attribute structure is serialised, which results in more objects than serialising a single attribute value.
The difference can be explained partially by the encrypted events being larger in size, because they include both the plaintext and the encrypted content in this test.
This test was designed to show that the use of the encrypted event content mechanism  between two authorised brokers incurs only a small  performance overhead.
