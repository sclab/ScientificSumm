The components of DIDSoG architecture have served as base for the integration of the resources presented in the simulation.
During the simulation, the different IDSs cooperated with one another in a distributed manner; however, in a coordinated way with an integrated view of the events, having, thus, the capability to detect distributed attacks.
In addition to the integration of IDSs enabled by a grid middleware, the cooperation of heterogeneous IDSs can be viewed as an economic problem.
The integration of distinct IDSs could be observed through the simulated environment.
The integration of heterogeneous IDSs is important.
