By carrying out a hierarchic relationship between the several chosen analysers for an environment, the sensor resource is not overloaded with the task to send the data to all the analysers.
Second, there is a great diversity of data aggregation techniques, data correlation and analysis, and intrusion response that can be applied to the same environment; these techniques can be organized under several levels of complexity. 
The DIDSoG can be modelled in accordance with the needs of each environment.
The division of scopes and the complexity levels make the processing of the data to be carried out in phases.
