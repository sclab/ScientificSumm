From the  experiments, we can also conclude that in order to improve the performances, we should fuse result lists of well performing IR models, and that majoritarian data fusion methods  perform better than positional methods.
In this paper, we address the rank aggregation problem where different, but not disjoint, lists of documents are to be fused.
combSUM [15]), are not initially  designed to work with such rankings.
The proposed method can have a real impact on Web metasearch performances since only ranks are available from most primary search engines , whereas most of the current approaches need scores to merge
