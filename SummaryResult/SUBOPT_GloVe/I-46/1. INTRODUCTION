However, as we argue in this paper, few existing representation languages are both modular, compact and computationally grounded on the one hand, and allow for representing properties of both knowledge and strategic ability, on the other.
The semantics of logics like the ones presented in Section 2 are usually defined over explicit models (Kripke structures) that enumerate all possible (global) states of the system.
We start with computation tree logic CTL, then we add knowledge (CTLK), and then we discuss two variants of alternating-time temporal logic (ATL): one for the perfect, and one for the imperfect information case.
