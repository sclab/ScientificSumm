The semantics of ATLir formulae can be defined as follows: M, q |= A ir fϕ iff there is a uniform collective strategy SA such that, for every a ∈ A, q such that q ∼a q , and λ ∈ out(SA, q ), we have M, λ[1] |= ϕ; 2 This is a deviation from the original semantics of ATL [3], where strategies assign agents" choices to sequences of states, which  suggests that agents can by definition recall the whole history of each game.
