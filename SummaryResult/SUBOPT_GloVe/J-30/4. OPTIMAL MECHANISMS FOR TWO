A corollary from the proof of Theorem 1 is that the optimal 2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the players has only k − 1 different actions).
The rightmost table show an example for a diagonal allocation scheme where one of the player has only k − 1 possible actions.
For optimizing the expected social value , this type for player 2 should clearly be the type for which the expected social value from A equals the expected social value from B ( given that player
