Our first result is a sufficient and necessary condition for the implementability of the  optimal solution achievable with k actions: this condition says that the optimal social-choice rule is achieved when all the 4 For simplicity, we assume that a maximum is attained and thus the optimal function is well defined.
Then, it will follow from Lemma 1 that the social choice function is implementable.
The basic intuition for the proof is that even for this general framework , we can construct mechanisms where the probability of having an allocation that is incompatible with the original social-choice function is O
