We say that a strategy si is dominant for player i in  mechanism (t, p) if player i cannot increase his utility by reporting a different action than si(θi), regardless of the actions of the other players b−i.3 Definition 2.
Note that the definition above requires that g will be  single crossing with respect to every player i, given her  individual order i on the alternatives.
When the action space is discrete, the order can be determined by the names of the actions, for example, 0, 1,...,k-1 for k-action mechanisms.
We define a k-action game to
