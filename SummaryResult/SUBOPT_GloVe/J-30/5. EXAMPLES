We can now apply  Theorem 2, and show that if the decision function f of the firm is multilinear (i.e., the decisions are made to maximize a set of multilinear functions), then the firm can design the education system such that the expected loss will be O( 1 k2 ), with a dominant-strategy equilibrium.
Figure 2 illustrates the optimal mechanisms for k = 2 , and shows how both the allocation scheme and the payments depend on the construction cost C. Then , the welfare-maximizing mechanisms are : â€¢ If the cost of building is at least 1 : Allocation :
