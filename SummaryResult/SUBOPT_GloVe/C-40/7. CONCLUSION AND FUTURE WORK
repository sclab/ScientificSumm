Our edge indexing model, however, can overcome such higher indexing complexity by indexing spatial extensions at edge-level not at node-level in a grid partitioned sub-world and was validated through quantitative analyses and simulations.
Currently, we are  developing another edge indexing method to make the indexing  complexity constant.
We expect that our edge indexing can contribute to  successful deployment of next-generation gaming environments. 
To support dynamic extensibility and scalability in highly dynamic environments, we proposed a new view paradigm, the object-initiated view model, and its efficient indexing method, edge indexing.
Compared with the traditional view model , our new view model
