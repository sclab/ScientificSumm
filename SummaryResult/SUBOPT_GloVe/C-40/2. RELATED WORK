Q-Index [13, 11] is one of the earlier work that re-discovers the usefulness of grid-based space partitioning for emerging  moving object environments.
Many studies have reported that the R-tree and its variants (R+  tree, Râˆ— -tree) suffer from unacceptable performance degradation in a highly dynamic environment, primarily due to the computational complexity of the split algorithm [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
As long as any object resides in this region, all the query results are guaranteed to be valid in the  system.
In contrast to traditional spatial indexing methods that construct an index on the moving objects , it builds
