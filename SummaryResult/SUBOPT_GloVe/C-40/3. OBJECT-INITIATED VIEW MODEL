The main strengths of the new model are that (1) it has no object popping problem as long as the underlying system can manage the optimal visible range of all object entities correctly and that (2) the content creators can produce an enriched expressiveness of various behavioral and temporal changes.
One of the potential arguments against the object-initiated view is that indexing of the spatial extension of an object is too complex to be practical, compared with the user-initiated view.
However , we employ a squareshaped AOI at the expense of accuracy because the square-shaped spatial extension is very simple
