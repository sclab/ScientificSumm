The total elapsed time of full update based single-table edge  indexing for a given set of moving entities is the summation of the elapsed time of updates and cell evaluations: (Ta + Td + Ts) · {|Q| + |O|2(m + 1)} (7) Similarly, the total elapsed time of two-table edge indexing is as follows: (Ta + Td + Ts) · {|Q| + |O|2(m + 1)} (8) From Equation 7 and 8 we conclude that two-table edge  indexing, even though it represents a minor optimization of single-table edge indexing by replacing unpredictable Td with predictable Td, achieves a significant performance improvement.
