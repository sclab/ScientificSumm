Rendering speed was not important at this time; our first goal was to implement the grid, and in that we succeeded.
We decided this was likely a Maya issue rather than an Xgrid issue, and the solution was to send the results to the network volume via the Perl script. 
This avoided sending the Maya files and associated textures to each agent as part of a working directory.
Everything we installed for testing was first created as a radmind base load or overload.
