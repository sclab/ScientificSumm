In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.
In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.
The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.
Since in the IT industry , various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing , we first sort out
