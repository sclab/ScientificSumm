In other words, the best candidates for grid computing are applications that run the same or very similar computations on a large number of pieces of data without any dependencies on the previous calculated results.
This is an important concern if we install a commercial application such as Maya on all members of our grid.
Of course, the applications must also run on the computing platform that hosts the grid.
2.1 Applications Appropriate for Grid Computing The applications used in grid computing must either be specifically designed for grid use , or scriptable in such a way that they can
