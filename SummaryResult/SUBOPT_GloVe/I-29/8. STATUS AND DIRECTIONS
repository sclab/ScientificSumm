To better address the problem of establishing inter-agent synchronization points, we expanding the use of task owners and qaf-specifc protocols as a means for  directing coordination activity.
Our current research efforts are aimed at extending the  capabilities of the Year 1 agent and scaling up to significantly larger problems.
To provide more global perspective to local scheduling  decisions, we are introducing mechanisms for computing,  communicating and using estimates of the non-local impact of remote nodes.
Finally , we plan to explore the use of more advanced STN-driven coordination mechanisms , including the use of temporal decoupling [ 7 ] to
