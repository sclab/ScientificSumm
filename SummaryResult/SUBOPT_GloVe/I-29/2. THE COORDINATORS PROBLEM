a may also inherit these constraints from ancestor tasks at any higher level in the task structure, and its effective execution window will be defined by the tightest of these constraints.
Instead, each agent receives only a subjective view containing just the portion of the task network that relates to ground tasks that it is responsible for and any remote tasks that have interdependencies with these local tasks.
Methods appear at the leaf level of C TAEMS task structures and are those that are directly executable in the world.
As execution proceeds , agents must react to unexpected results (
