Layered over this is a non-local option generation and evaluation process (similar in some respects to [5]), aimed at identification of opportunities for global improvement through joint changes to the schedules of  multiple agents.
Such factors as geographical separation of executing agents, limitations on communication bandwidth, constraints relating to chain of command and the high tempo of execution dynamics may all preclude any single agent from obtaining a complete global view of the problem, and hence necessitate collaborative yet localized planning and scheduling decisions.
To provide a basis for distributed coordination , each agent is aware of dependencies between its
