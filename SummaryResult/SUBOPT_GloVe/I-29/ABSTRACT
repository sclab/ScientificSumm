Using a simulator to model the environment, we compare the  performance of our multi-agent system with that of an expected optimal (but non-scalable) centralized MDP solver.
We describe an agent architecture for solving this problem that couples two basic mechanisms: (1) a flexible times representation of the agent"s schedule (using a Simple Temporal Network) and (2) an incremental rescheduling procedure.
We consider the problem of managing schedules in an  uncertain, distributed environment.
Then , as time permits , the core local problem solving infra-structure is used to drive an inter-agent option generation and query process , aimed at
