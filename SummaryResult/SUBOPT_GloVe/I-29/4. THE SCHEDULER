As new methods are inserted into a schedule or  external state updates require adjustments to existing constraints (e.g., substitution of an actual duration constraint,  tightening of a deadline), the network propagates constraints and maintains lower and upper bounds on all time points in the network.
Subsequent calls to the propagator occur as the allocator installs methods on the agent"s timeline: failure of the allocator to install a method causes the propagator to recompute a new list of contributors and activators.
The quality propagator analyzes the activity hierarchy and collects a set of methods that ( if scheduled )
