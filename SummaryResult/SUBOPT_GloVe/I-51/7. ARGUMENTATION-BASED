• If Ai cannot generate any counterargument or  counterexample, the token is sent to the next agent, a new round t + 1 starts, and the protocol moves to state 2.
The voting mechanism uses the joint confidence measure as the voting weights, as follows: S = arg max Sk∈S αi∈Ht|αi.S=Sk C(αi) Moreover, in order to avoid infinite iterations, if an agent sends twice the same argument or counterargument to the same agent, the message is not considered. 
After that, the agent informs all the other agents about the problem P to solve, and the protocol starts: 1.
Moreover ,
