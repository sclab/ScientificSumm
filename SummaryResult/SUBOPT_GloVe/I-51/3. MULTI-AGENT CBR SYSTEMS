A justification built by a CBR method after determining that the solution of a particular problem P was Sk is a description that  contains the relevant information from the problem P that the CBR method has considered to predict Sk as the solution of P. In  particular, CBR methods work by retrieving similar cases to the problem at hand, and then reusing their solutions for the current problem, expecting that since the problem and the cases are similar, the  solutions will also be similar.
In general , the meaning of a justification is that all ( or most of )
