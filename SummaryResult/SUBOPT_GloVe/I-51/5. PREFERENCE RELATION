Figure 2 illustrates the individual evaluation of the confidence of an argument , in particular , three endorsing cases and one counterexample are found in the case base of agents Ai , giving an estimated confidence of 0.6 Moreover , we can also define the joint confidence of an argument α as the confidence computed using the cases present in the case bases of all the agents in the group : C ( α ) = i Y Ai α 1 + i Y Ai α + NAi α Notice that , to collaboratively compute the joint confidence , the
