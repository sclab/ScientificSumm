The additional consideration we have is that each user i has a budget constraint Xi.
Now, player 2 has to put a positive bid on machine 2 to claim the machine, but there is no lower limit, resulting in the non-existence of the Nash equilibrium.
The question we are most interested in is whether there exists a collection of bidding vectors, one for each user, such that each user"s bidding vector is the best response to those of the other users.
Our definition of utility functions corresponds to the user having enough jobs or enough parallelism within jobs
