For example, we assume that there is no parallelization cost, and there is no performance degradation when multiple users share the same machine.
Another assumption is that users have infinite work, so the more resources they can  acquire, the better.
When the job size is large enough and the degree of multiplexing is sufficiently low, we can probably ignore those effects, but those costs should be taken into account for a more realistic modeling.
One direction is to consider more realistic utility functions.
In addition , with a few exceptions under the finite parallelism model , the system reaches equilibrium
