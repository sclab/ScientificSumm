As part of the fixed budget game analysis, we show that strategic users with linear  utility functions can calculate their bids using a best response algorithm that quickly results in an allocation with high  efficiency with little computational and communication  overhead.
In this work, we examine a price-anticipating scheme in the context of allocating computational  capacity for users with private preferences and limited budgets, resulting in a qualitatively different game (as discussed in Section 6).
In Section 4, we describe algorithms for users to optimize their own utility in the fixed budget game.
In this paper , we formulate the
