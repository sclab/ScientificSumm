we consider that the system has converged if the utility gap of each user is smaller than (0.001 in our experiments).
For both user preference models, the efficiency at the  equilibrium is approximately 0.9, independent of the number of users, which is only slightly worse than the social optimum.
In the following simulations, we fix the number of  machines to 100 and vary the number of users from 5 to 250 (but we only report the results for the range of 5 − 150 users since the results remain similar for a larger number of users).
When ∆ = 5
