Though the algorithms for  accomplishing such an arrangement are legion, our analysis focuses on k-means clustering5 , during which, each  observation oi is assigned to the cluster Ck whose centroid is closest to it, in terms of Euclidean distance.
As described in [12], the goal of cluster analysis is to assign each of the n observations to one of a small number k groups, each of which is characterized by high intra-cluster correlation and low inter-cluster correlation.
Readers interested in the details of the algorithm are referred to [12] for a  thorough treatment of the subject.
However , k-means clustering requires
