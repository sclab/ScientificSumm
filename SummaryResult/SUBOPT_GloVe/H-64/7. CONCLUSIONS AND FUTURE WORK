In current work we have defined algorithms to identify  documents likely to help the topic discovery task.
As we have argued in this paper, these methods may also be brought to bear on the design and implementation of advanced user interfaces.
Instead of clustering documents to find topics and then fitting a model to the learned clusters, our goal is to expand the unsupervised portion of our analysis beyond a narrow subset of the collection, such as The Editor"s Desk.
Empirical  methods of knowledge discovery can aid in the organization and retrieval of information.
