More specifically, we apply the algorithm HS of Figure 6 to our full index IF and create a keyword-pruned p-index IP of size s. For the construction of our keyword-pruned p-index we used the query frequencies observed during the first 10 days of our data set.
This implies that our EKS algorithm can successfully identify the necessary  postings for calculating the top-20 results for 70% of the queries by using at least 40% of the full index size.
For example, approximately 73% of the queries can be answered using 30% of the original index.
The results of Figure 11 ,
