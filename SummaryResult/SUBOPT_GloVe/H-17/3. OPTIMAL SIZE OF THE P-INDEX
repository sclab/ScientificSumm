To find out the answer, we first compute the number of machines needed when we use IP 1 for the 1st tier.
2 The above example shows that the cost of the two-tier  architecture depends on two important parameters: the size of the p-index and the fraction of the queries that can be handled by the 1st tier index alone.
We can do similar analysis when we use IP 2 and see that a total of 14 machines are needed when IP 2 is used.
Intuitively , there exists a clear tradeoff between the size of IP and the fraction
