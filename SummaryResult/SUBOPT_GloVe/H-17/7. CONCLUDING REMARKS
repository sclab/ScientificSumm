In this paper, we provided a framework for new pruning techniques and answer computation algorithms that guarantee that the top matching pages are always placed at the top of search results in the correct order.
Our experimental results demonstrated that our algorithms can effectively be used to prune an inverted index without degradation in the quality of results.
While this  approach may improve performance, by computing the top results from a pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in the result quality.
When we combine the two pruning algorithms we can guarantee 60 % of the queries with an
