Our contribution is a  number of modifications in the pruning techniques for creating the pruned index and a new result computation algorithm that  guarantees that the top-matching pages are always placed at the top search results, even though we are computing the first batch from the pruned index most of the time.
In order to cope with the vast amounts of query loads, search engines prune their index to keep documents that are likely to be returned as top results, and use this pruned index to compute the first batches of results.
While this approach can improve performance by reducing
