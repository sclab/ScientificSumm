We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.
In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.
Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the user"s information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.
With such a conjugate prior , the predictive distribution of φ ( or equivalently , the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by
