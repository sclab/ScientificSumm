We first observe the general result that as the number of advertising agents increases, and thus the competition between them increases, then the mean normalised exposure of all allocation mechanisms decreases.
However, in all cases the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform the simple bidding agent (p < 0.0005 in Student"s t-test), and its performance is within 7.5% of that of the optimal allocation that has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.
Increasing the period of interest of each agent decreases the mean normalised exposure , since
