As explained in [13], the three main steps for building a WCN from a word lattice are as follows: 1.
Typical structures of a lattice and a WCN are given in Figure 1.
Each vertex in a lattice is  associated with a timestamp and each edge (u, v) is labeled with a word or phone hypothesis and its prior probability, which is the probability of the signal delimited by the timestamps of the vertices u and v, given the hypothesis.
One of the main advantages of WCN is that it also provides an alignment for all of the words in
