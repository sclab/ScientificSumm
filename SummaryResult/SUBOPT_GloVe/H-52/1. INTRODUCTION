Therefore, we cannot merge posting lists retrieved by phonetic index with those retrieved by word index since the offset of the occurrences retrieved from the two different indices are not comparable.
A solution would be to combine the two different  approaches presented above: we index both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts; during query processing, the  information is retrieved from the word index for IV terms and from the phonetic index for OOV terms.
The indexing and retrieval methods are presented in section 3.
We analyze the retrieval effectiveness of this approach on the NIST Spoken Term Detection 2006 evaluation
