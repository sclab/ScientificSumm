[17] propose a model for spoken document retrieval using WCNs in order to improve the recall and the MAP of the search.
A generic IR system over the text is used for word spotting and search as described by Brown et al.
Consequently, phonetic approaches should be used only for OOV search; for  searching queries containing also IV terms, this technique affects the performance of the retrieval in comparison to the word based approach.
An alternative approach consists of using word lattices in order to improve the effectiveness of SDR.
They propose three different retrieval strategies : search both the
