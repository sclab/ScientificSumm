This problem is non-trivial since typical mobile object frameworks consist of multiple application and middleware components, and thus metrics collection must be performed at different locations and the results efficiently propagated to the adaptation engine.
In the case of MobJeX, although an adaptation engine has been implemented [5], preliminary testing was done using synthetic pre-scripted metrics since there is little prior work on the dynamic collection of software metrics in mobile object frameworks, and no existing means of automatically collecting them.
Consequently , the main contribution of this paper is a solution for dynamic metrics collection to support adaptation via
