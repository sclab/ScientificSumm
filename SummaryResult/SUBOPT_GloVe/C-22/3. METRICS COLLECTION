The primary advantage of aggregating metrics in containers is that it allows them to be propagated easily as a cohesive unit through the components of the mobility framework so that they can be delivered to the adaptation engine, as discussed in the following subsection.
For the other model entities, this serves as an opportunity to determine both when and what metrics should be pushed to the parent container wherein the case of the ServiceModelEntity the parent is the adaptation engine itself or in the case of the ProxyMetricsContainer the target of the push is the MobjectMetricsContainer.
A simple example of
