In addition, further testing provided an initial indication of the characteristics of application objects (based on method execution time) that would be good candidates for adaptation using the worst case implementation of the proposed metrics collection strategy.
One such approach could be based on maintaining metrics history in order to determine the temporal behaviour of metrics and thus make more intelligent and conservative decisions regarding whether a change in a particular metric is likely to be of interest to the adaptation engine and should thus serve as a basis for notification for inclusion in the next metrics push.
