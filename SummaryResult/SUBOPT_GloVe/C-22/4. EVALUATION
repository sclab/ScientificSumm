Figure 2 shows the metric collection overhead in the mobject (MMCO), for different numbers of mobjects and methods when all criteria are set to always to provide the maximum measurement and propagation of metrics and thus an absolute worst case performance scenario.
These results are encouraging since even for the worst case scenario of n=1 the metric collection overhead is an acceptable 20 % for a method of 1500ms duration ( which is relatively short for a component or service level object in a distributed enterprise class application ) with previous work on adaptation showing that such an overhead could
