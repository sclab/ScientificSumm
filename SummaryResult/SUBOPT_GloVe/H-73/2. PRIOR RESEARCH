As prior research on different datasets has shown the CORI algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [1,17,18], we use it as a baseline algorithm in this work.
In order to achieve accurate document retrieval results, many previous methods simply use resource selection algorithms that are effective of database recommendation system.
Second, the DTF builds a model for each database to calculate the probabilities of relevance.
The centralized sample database can serve as a bridge to connect the individual databases with the centralized logistic model , thus the probabilities of relevance of documents in different
