DATABASE RECOMMENDATION All four testbeds described in Section 4 were used in the experiments to evaluate the resource selection effectiveness of the database recommendation system.
It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ReDDE and UUM/HR algorithms are more effective (on the representative, relevant and nonrelevant testbeds) or as good as (on the Trec123-100Col testbed) the CORI resource selection algorithm.
Resource selection algorithms of database recommendation systems are typically compared using the recall metric nR [1,17,18,21].
And let Bi and Ei denote the number of relevant documents in the ith ranked database of B or E. Then Rn is
