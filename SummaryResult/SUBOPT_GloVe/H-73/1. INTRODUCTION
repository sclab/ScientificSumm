Distributed information retrieval, also known as federated search [1,4,7,11,14,22] is different from ad-hoc information retrieval as it addresses the cases when documents cannot be acquired and stored in a single database.
Two key features make it a more solid model for distributed information retrieval: i) It formalizes the resource selection problems of different applications as various utility functions, and optimizes the utility functions to achieve the optimal results accordingly; and ii) It shows an effective and efficient way to estimate the probabilities of relevance of all documents across databases.
This paper presents a unified utility maximization framework to integrate
