3.1 Estimating Probabilities of Relevance As pointed out above, the purpose of resource selection is  highrecall and the purpose of document retrieval is high-precision.
However, in order to calculate the probabilities of relevance, we need to estimate centralized document scores for all documents across the databases instead of only the sampled documents.
Formally, we denote di as the number of documents we would like to retrieve from the ith database and ,.....},{ 21 ddd = as a selection action for all the databases.
The logistic model is used to estimate the centralized document score of the top 1 document in
