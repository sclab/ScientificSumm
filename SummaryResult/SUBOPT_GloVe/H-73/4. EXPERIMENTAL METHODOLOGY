However, two weakness of this testbed are: i) Each database contains only a small amount of document (259 documents by average for WT2g) [4]; and ii) The contents of WT2g or WT10g are arbitrarily crawled from the Web.
Three testbeds in [21] with skewed database size distributions and different types of relevant document distributions were also used to give more thorough simulation for real environments.
As the contents and sizes of the databases in the TREC news/government testbed are more similar with that of a topic-oriented database , it is a good candidate to simulate the distributed information retrieval environments
