In the realm of software architectures, this core has been formalised as an operational model of social  connectors, intended to describe both the basic structure and  dynamics of multi-agent interactions, from the largest (the agent society itself) down to the smallest ones  (communicative actions).
Thus, the proposed model is not intended to capture every organizational or communicative feature of multi-agent interactions, but to reveal their roots in basic interaction mechanisms.
On top of the presented execution semantics , current and future work aims at the specification of the type system [ 19 ] which allows to program the abstract machine
