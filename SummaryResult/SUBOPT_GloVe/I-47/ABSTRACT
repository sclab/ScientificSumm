The social stance advocated by institutional frameworks and most multi-agent system methodologies has resulted in a wide spectrum of organizational and communicative  abstractions which have found currency in several programming frameworks and software platforms.
In the realm of software architectures, the paper proposes a connector-based model of multi-agent interactions which attempts to identify the essential structure underlying multi-agent interactions.
Furthermore, the paper also provides this model with a formal execution semantics which describes the dynamics of social interactions.
Still , these tools and frameworks are designed to support a limited range of interaction capabilities that constrain developers to a fixed
