With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.
Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level.
A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level.
â€¢ Incremental Random Walk Protocol ( IRWP ) : When an update ( or updates ) occur in the system , instead of starting random walks at k random nodes in the network , all
