Wireless radios of the future will likely be frequency-agile, that is, supporting opportunistic and adaptive use of the RF spectrum.
The inherent requirements of such data and the time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this problem both interesting and technically challenging.
We focus on the problem of sharing RF spectrum data among a collection of wireless devices.
Such radios must coordinate with each other to build an accurate and consistent map of spectral  utilization in their surroundings.
We outline an initial solution incorporating these ideas and also show how our approach reduces network overhead by up to a
