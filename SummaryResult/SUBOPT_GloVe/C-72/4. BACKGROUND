This  aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the  network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e.
2 Convergence refers to the state in which all nodes have the most up-to-date view of the network.
Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.
The intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss experiments increases , the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes
