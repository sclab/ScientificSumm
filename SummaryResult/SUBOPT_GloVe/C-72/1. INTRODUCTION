In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations.
New spectrum allocation regimes implemented by the FCC use dynamic spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or opportunistically allocate RF spectrum to unlicensed secondary users Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice
