As well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing  information.
Deciding if a change is significant can be done using a significance threshold Î², below which any  observed change is not propagated by the node.
Implementation Specifics: Finally, implementing  gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open.
One challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.
Spatially decaying  aggregates work by successively reducing (by means of a decay function) the value of the update as it propagates further from its origin.
Therefore
