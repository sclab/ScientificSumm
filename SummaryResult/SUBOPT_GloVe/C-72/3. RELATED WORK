As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].
The CORVUS [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters.
As a result, simple local  sensing approaches have not gained much momentum.
This has been shown by Sahai et al.
Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches , these techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters , which not only
