Random walk would operate by having devices periodically drop the aggregate and re-run the protocol.
Using either incremental random walk or incremental  gossip, each device proceeds through three phases, in order to determine the global average signal level for a particular frequency band.

This is different from the protocol discussed above where only  updated nodes initiate random walks.
