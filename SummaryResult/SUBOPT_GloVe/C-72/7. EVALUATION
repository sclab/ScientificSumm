In each run of the simulation, we induce a change in the measured signal at one or more devices.
Finally, in order to isolate the effect of protocol  operation on performance, we do not model the complexities of the wireless channel in our simulations.
We study the improvements of our  incremental gossip protocols over standard gossiping in two  dimensions: execution time and network overhead.
A run ends when the new average signal level has converged in the network.
We use two topologies to represent device connectivity : a clique , to eliminate the effects of the underlying topology on protocol
