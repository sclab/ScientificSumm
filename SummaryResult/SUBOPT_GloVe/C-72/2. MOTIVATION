However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.
Large Sensory Data: Because cognitive radios can  potentially use any part of the RF spectrum, there will be  numerous channels that they need to scan.
Short Timescales: Further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated RF sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely  fashion.
By applying gossip and FM aggregation , aggregate bandwidth
