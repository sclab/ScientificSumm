Follows immediately from Theorem 3 and the fact that for any JAR f, there is a SWF F such that f = fF .
We can then interpret our formulae in an SWF F over K , a preference profile L ∈ L ( K ) and a pair ( a , b ) ⊆ K × K , a b , as follows : F , L , ( a , b ) |=swf φ ⇔ fF , γL , aPb |=LK φ where γL is the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile L. While in the general judgment aggregation
