, An , where Ai is the  individual judgment set of agent i. J(A, L) denotes the set of all individual (complete and L-consistent) judgment sets over A, and J(A, L)n the set of all judgment profiles over A.
We sometimes use the infix notation aRb for (a, b) ∈ R. The set of preference relations over alternatives K is denoted L(K).
When γ ∈ J(A, L)n , we use γi to denote the ith element of γ, i.e., agent i"s individual judgment set in judgment profile γ.
Formally , let K be a set
