In a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=L σ and f, γ, q |=L ¬σ.
and there exists an aggregation rule f over A such that f |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i).
Assume that the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication (i.e., A contains p, q, p → q for some p, q ∈ L(L)).
Since f(γ) is complete, ¬q ∈ f(γ).
