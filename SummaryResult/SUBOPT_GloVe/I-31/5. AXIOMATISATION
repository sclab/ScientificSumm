In fact, our  axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of f. To be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ.
It is easy to see that table descriptions are mutually exclusive, and, moreover, we can derive τ∈T τ, where T is the set of all table descriptions.
We don '' t want all of those : it might well be that ψ requires σ to be in a certain way , which is incompatible with some Δ '' s. We define two accessibility relations in the
