In future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness and consistency requirements of judgment sets, and try to  characterise these in the logical language, as properties of general  judgment sets, instead. 
The axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical Arrovian  preference aggregation.
We argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about  judgment aggregation.
jal provides a proof theory , in which results such as those mentioned above can be
