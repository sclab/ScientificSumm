In this case, the number of Ïˆ values is exponential in each agent"s planning horizon Tm, resulting in a much larger program.
2.2 Combinatorial Resource Scheduling A straightforward approach to resource scheduling for a set of agents M, whose values for the resources are induced by stochastic planning problems (in our case, finite-horizon MDPs) would be to have each agent enumerate all possible resource assignments over time and, for each one, compute its value by solving the corresponding MDP.
