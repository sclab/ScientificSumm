In this paper, we extend the work on resource allocation under MDP-induced preferences to discrete-time scheduling problems, where agents are present in the system for finite time intervals and can only use resources within these  intervals.
In particular, when the value of a set of resources to an agent is not additive (as is often the case with resources that are substitutes or complements), the utility function might have to be defined on an exponentially large space of resource bundles, which very quickly becomes  computationally intractable.
An alternative is to directly model the mechanisms that define the agents '' utility
