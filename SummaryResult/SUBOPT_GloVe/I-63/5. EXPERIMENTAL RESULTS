The top row shows how the solution time for the MILP scales as we  increase the number of agents |M|, the global time horizon bτ, and the number of resources |Ω|.
In particular, this section introduces a problem domain-the repairshop problem-used to empirically evaluate our algorithm"s  scalability in terms of the number of agents |M|, the number of shared resources |Ω|, and the varied lengths of global time bτ during which agents may enter and exit the system.
The bottom row of Figure 3 shows the joint policy value of the policies that correspond to the computed optimal
