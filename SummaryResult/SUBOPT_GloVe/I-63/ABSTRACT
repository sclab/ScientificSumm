Optimal resource scheduling in multiagent systems is a  computationally challenging task, particularly when the values of resources are not additive.
However, this prior work has focused on static resource-allocation  problems where resources are distributed once and then utilized in infinite-horizon MDPs.
We consider the combinatorial problem of scheduling the usage of multiple resources among agents that operate in stochastic environments, modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs).
We provide a computationally  efficient procedure for computing globally optimal resource assignments to agents over time.
We extend those existing models to the problem of combinatorial resource scheduling , where agents persist only for
