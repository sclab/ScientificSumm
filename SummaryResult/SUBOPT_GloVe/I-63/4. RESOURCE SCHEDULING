Finally, for the problem formulation where resource  assignments are static during a lifetime of an agent, we add a constraint that ensures that the resource-usage variables Δ do not change their value while the agent is active (θ = 1).
The meaning of the activity  indicators θ is illustrated in Figure 2b: when agent m is in either the start state sb or the finish state sf , the corresponding θm = 0, but once the agent becomes active and enters one of the other states, we set θm = 1 .
This constraint is not used for the dynamic problem formulation , where resources
