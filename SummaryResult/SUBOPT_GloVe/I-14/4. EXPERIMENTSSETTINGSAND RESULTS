In our experiments, λ is set as 0.0543 so that the mean of the incoming queries from the environment to the agent network is 50 per time unit.
The average reward for TSLA approach, where learning algorithm is exploited, starts at the same level with the TSNA algorithm and improves the average reward over time until 2000−2500 queries joining the system.
However, it remains as future work to discover the  correlation between the magnitude of the performance gains and the size of the data collection and/or the extent of the  heterogeneity between the sub-collections. 
Table 1 shows that the performance
