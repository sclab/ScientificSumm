To our best knowledge, this is one of the first reinforcement learning applications in addressing distributed content  sharing problems and it is indicative of some of the issues in applying reinforcement in a complex application.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 reviews the hierarchical content sharing systems and the two-phase search algorithm based on such topology.
The intention of the reinforcement learning is to adapt the agents" routing decisions to the dynamic network situations and learn from past search sessions.
In the past work , we have shown that this organization improves search performance
