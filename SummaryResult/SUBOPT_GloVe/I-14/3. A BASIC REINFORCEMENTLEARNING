After collecting the utilization rate information from all its neighbors, agent Ai computes Li as a single measure for assessing the average load  condition of its neighborhood: Li = P k Lk |DirectConn(Ai)| Agents exploit Li value in determining the routing  probability in its routing policy.
Note that based on the characteristics of the queries entering the system and agents" capabilities, the loading of agents may not be uniform.
Therefore, equation (2) means that the probability of  forwarding the search session to agent Ai0 is πi(QSi, αi0 ) and so on.
This heuristic is based on the fact that
