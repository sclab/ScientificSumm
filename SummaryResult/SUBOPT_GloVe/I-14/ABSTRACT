In these approaches, agents depend on the content similarity between incoming queries and their direct neighboring agents to direct the distributed search sessions.
Based on this information, the agents derive corresponding routing policies.
In this paper, an online reinforcement-learning based approach is developed to take advantage of the  dynamic run-time characteristics of P2P IR systems as  represented by information about past search sessions.
Specifically, agents maintain estimates on the downstream agents" abilities to provide relevant documents for incoming queries.
Experimental results demonstrate that the learning algorithm improves considerably the routing performance on two test collection sets that have been
