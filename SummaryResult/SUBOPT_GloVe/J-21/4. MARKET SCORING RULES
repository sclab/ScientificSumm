Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, φMSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)].
Consider the restricted projection game with some prior probability distribution F over possible values of p. Then , there is a probability distribution G with the same support as F , and a strictly positive constant c that depends only on F such that : • ( i ) For any collection X of moves , the expected profits are related by
