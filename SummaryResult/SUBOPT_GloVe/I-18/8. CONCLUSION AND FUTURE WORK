Through the tuning of the strategies (α, and λ) and their plastic interlacing within the protocol, it is  possible to coordinate agents without additional communication: the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same between informed simulations and simulations implementing strategies.
Future works will focus on new strategies to solve new conflicts, specially those arising when relaxing the  independence assumption between the requests.
An epidemic  communication protocol uses all communication opportunities to update this information.
In order to increase the global mission outcome, we propose an hybrid approach: deliberative for individual planning and reactive for  collaboration.
Agents reason both on
