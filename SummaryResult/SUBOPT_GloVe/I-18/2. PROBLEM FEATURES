A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar  areas, and thus can communicate without the ground  intervention.
Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.
An observation satellite constellation is a set of satellites in various orbits whose mission is to take pictures of various areas on the Earth surface, for example hot points  corresponding to volcanos or forest fires.
