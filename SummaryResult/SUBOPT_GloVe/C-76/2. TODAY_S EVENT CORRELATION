The fields which are used to find a similar case and their importance have to be defined appropriately.
In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event  correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.
It is also possible to find the dependencies by analyzing interactions [7].
As all components of a network are represented with their behavior in the model, it is possible to perform simulations to predict how the whole network will  behave.
The first kind of nodes are the faults ( denoted as problems in the cited papers )
