As the service-oriented event correlation has to use  dependencies of a service from subservices and resources, the model is used in the following to derive the needed  information for service events.
The fields date, status, and other service events are not derived directly from the Service Model, but are necessary for the event correlation process. 
Associated to each service is a list of QoS parameters which have to be met by the service at the service access point.
Derived from the MNM Service Model we define the  information necessary for a service event.
