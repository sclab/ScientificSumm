Another  possibility for the use of active probing is a request from the event correlator, if the current correlation result needs to be  improved.
As next step in the event  correlation process the service events should be correlated with each other using the service dependencies, because the  service dependencies have no direct relationship to the resource level.
The aim is find out where event correlation can be found in the process structure and how detailed the frameworks currently are.
Event correlation is only mentioned in the resource management, but it is not used in the service level.
The results of
