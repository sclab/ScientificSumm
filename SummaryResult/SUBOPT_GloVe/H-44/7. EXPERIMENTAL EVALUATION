We also measured wall-clock times on a sample of the queries with results indicating improvements in execution time by up to a factor of 12. 
For both the WIKI and UKGOV datasets, we compare temporally coalesced indexes for different values of the error threshold computed using Algorithm 1 with the non-coalesced index as a baseline.
In order to evaluate this aspect , we compared the top-k results computed using a coalesced index against the ground-truth result obtained from the original index , for different cutoff levels k. Let Gk and Ck be the top-k documents from the ground-truth result and
