We can classify the related work mainly into the following two categories: (i) methods that deal explicitly with  collections of versioned documents or temporal databases, and (ii) methods for reducing the index size by exploiting either the document-content overlap or by pruning portions of the index.
They also do not consider temporal aspects of documents, and thus are  technically quite different from our proposal despite having a shared goal of index-size reduction.
It should be noted that index-pruning techniques can be adapted to work along with the temporal text index we propose here.
