The second factor widf ( v , t ) , which we refer to as the idf-score in the remainder , conveys the inverse document frequency of term v in the collection at time t and is defined as widf ( v , t ) = log N ( t ) âˆ’ df ( v , t ) + 0.5 df ( v , t ) + 0.5 where N ( t ) = |Dt | is the collection size at time t and df ( v , t ) gives the number of documents in the collection that contain
