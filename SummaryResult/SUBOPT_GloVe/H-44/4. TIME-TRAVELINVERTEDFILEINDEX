We transparently extend the  sequential reading, which is - to the best of our  knowledgecommon to all query processing techniques on inverted file indexes, thus making them suitable for time-travel  queryprocessing.
The sort-order of index lists depends on which queries are to be supported efficiently.
We note that our proposed extension of the inverted file index makes no assumptions about the sort-order of  index lists.
The postings in our time-travel inverted file index are thus of the form ( d , p , [ tb , te ) ) where d and p are defined as in the standard inverted file
