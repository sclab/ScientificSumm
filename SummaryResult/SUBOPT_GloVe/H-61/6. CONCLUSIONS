For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.
In this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for  associating ads with a Web page that is browsed  (contenttargeted advertising).
This was obtained by a  strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.
The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to
