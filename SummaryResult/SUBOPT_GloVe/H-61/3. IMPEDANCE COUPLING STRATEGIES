Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new  representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).
By using α = 0 , we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α , we relax the context of the page p , adding terms from neighbor pages , turning page
