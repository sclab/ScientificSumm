The key design goal of the tree construction mechanism is to have each node be an intermediate node in at most one tree (while observing both inbound and  outbound node bandwidth constraints), thereby reducing the impact of a single node"s sudden departure on the rest of the system.
Since its foremost emphasis is reliability, the system does not attempt to improve the bandwidth delivered to the overlay participants by sending disjoint data at each level.
Similar to Bullet , BitTorrent incorporates the notion of choking at each node with the goal of identifying receivers that benefit the most
