Figure 10 shows the resulting bandwidth over time for the non-disjoint strategy in which a node (and more  importantly, the root of the tree) attempts to send all data to each of its children (subject to independent losses at  individual child links).
Since there is currently ample bandwidth available throughout the PlanetLab overlay ( a characteristic not necessarily representative of the Internet at large ) , we designed this experiment to show that Bullet can achieve higher bandwidth than an overlay tree when the source is constrained , for instance in cases of congestion on its outbound access link ,
