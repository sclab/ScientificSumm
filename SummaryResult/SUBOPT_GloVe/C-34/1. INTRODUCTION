In this paper, we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution model of sensor networks, and for which, we propose a new pairwise key pre-distribution scheme.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Combining the deployment knowledge of sensor networks and the polynomial pool-based key pre-distribution, we setup a  clusterbased topology that is practical with the real deployment of sensor networks.
As one of the most fundamental security services, pairwise key establishment enables the sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques.
Though hypercube-based scheme ( we consider the grid-based scheme is a special case
