So according to the theorem 1, we can know that nodes A, I1,…,It-1, B form a correct key path between node A and B.
6.3 Path Key Discovery If d>1, then node A can establish path key with node B according to the following theorem 2: Theorem 2: For any two sensor nodes A(i1i2…in,j1j2…jm) and B (i'1i'2…i'n,j'1j'2…j'm) in the sensor network, supposing that the distance between nodes A and B is d= d1+ d2, where d1=dh(i1i2…in, i'1i'2…i'n) and d2=dh(j1j2…jm, j'1j'2…j'm).
Once the key path P is computed out , then
