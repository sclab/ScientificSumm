Definition 5 (k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube): Let there are N nodes totally, then a k-levels Hierarchical Hypercube named H(k,u,m,v,n) can be constructed as follows: 1) The N nodes are divided into k clusters averagely, and the [N/k] nodes in any cluster are connected into an n-dimensional Hypercube: In the n-dimensional Hypercube, any node is encoded 55 as i1i2…in, which are called In-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, where 0 ≤ i1,i2,…in ≤ v-1,v=[ n kN / ],[j] equals to an integer not less than j.
Proof : Since the diameter of n-dimensional hypercube is n , and the diameter
