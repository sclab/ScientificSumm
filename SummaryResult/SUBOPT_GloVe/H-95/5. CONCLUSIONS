In queries where a geographical reference is not explicitly mentioned, we  propose to use the results for the query, exploiting geographic scopes previously assigned to these documents.

After place references are appropriately disambiguated into ontology concepts, a GIR system can use them to retrieve relevant results, through the use of appropriate index structures (e.g.
The regular Google search interface already does this , by presenting a link to Google
