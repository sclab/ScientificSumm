If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.
At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 
Therefore, because processes are structured by  nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing  resources.
The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution , which takes advantage of potentially all
