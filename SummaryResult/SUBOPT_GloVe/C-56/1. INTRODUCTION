The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed  process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled,  structured and localized way.
In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.
Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities.
Complementary , the support infrastructure , which executes a process specification , takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of a
