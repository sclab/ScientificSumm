The whole computation is made by a process, which uses a parallel controller to start and dispatch several concurrent activities of the same type, in order to find prime numbers.
The advantage of using controllers is the possibility of the support infrastructure determines the point of execution the process is in, allowing automatic recovery and monitoring, and also the capability of instantiating and dispatching  process elements only when there are enough computing  resources available, reducing unnecessary overhead.
It receives , through its input parameters , a range of integers in which prime numbers have to be found , the number
