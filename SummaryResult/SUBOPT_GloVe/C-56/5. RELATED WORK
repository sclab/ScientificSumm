Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture  contains widely distributed process coordinators, which  coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.
The architecture proposed in this paper, which  encompasses a programming model and an execution support  infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.
The previously referred architectures and others that  enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.
There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing , aiming to provide interfaces
