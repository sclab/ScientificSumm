For adjusted  noenvy, if (σ, t) is an allocation for some q ∈ Q, let tij be the 237 transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with respect to ordering σij .
This gives us the Shapley value rule by Lemma 3.
An allocation rule satisfies no-envy if for all q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), and i, j ∈ N, we have πi ≤ ci(σij ) − tj, where π is the cost share from allocation rule (σ, t) and σij is the ordering obtaining by swapping i and j.
