We also extend the envy results in [2] to our setting and discuss a class of reasonable cost sharing mechanisms. 
First best implementation means that there exists an efficient  mechanism in which jobs in the queue have a dominant strategy to reveal their true types and their transfers add up to zero.
1.1 Our Contribution Ours is the first model which considers cost sharing when both processing time and per unit waiting cost of jobs are present.
A key axiom that we introduce gives us a bound on cost share of a job in a group of jobs which have
