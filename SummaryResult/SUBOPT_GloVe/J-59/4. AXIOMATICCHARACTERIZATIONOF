Using this argument for every i ∈ N and using the expression for the Shapley value in Lemma 3, we get the Shapley value rule.
Consider any job i, in an efficient ordering σ, if we increase the value of γj for some j = i such that σj > σi, then the set Pi ( preceding jobs) does not change in the new efficient ordering.
This gives us the Shapley values of jobs i through n. Setting i = 1, we get cost shares of all the jobs from ψ as the Shapley value.
Applying this procedure for every j < i with
