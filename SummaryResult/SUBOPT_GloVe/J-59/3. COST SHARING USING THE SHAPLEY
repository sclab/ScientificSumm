Let σ∗ be an efficient ordering of jobs in set N. For all i ∈ N, the Shapley value is given by, SVi = piθi + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢, where Li = θi £j∈Pi(σ∗) pj and Ri = pi £j∈Fi(σ∗) θj.
We will show by induction that ∆(S) = 0 if |S| > 2.
(1) The Shapley value allocation rule says that jobs are ordered using an efficient ordering and transfers are assigned to jobs such that the cost share of job i is given by Equation 1.
This gives ∆ ( { i } ) = C ( { i }
