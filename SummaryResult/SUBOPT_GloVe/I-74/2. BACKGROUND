In general, since Δ may be inconsistent, arguments in A(Δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from Δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: Definition 2.2.
The set of acceptable arguments for an argumentation system A(Δ), Undercut, Pref is recursively defined as: A(Δ) = [ Fi≥0(∅) = AUndercut,Pref ∪ h[ Fi≥1(AUndercut,Pref ) i An argument is acceptable if it is a member of the acceptable set, and a proposition is acceptable if it is the conclusion of an acceptable argument.
