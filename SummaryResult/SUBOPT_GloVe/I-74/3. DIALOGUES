Thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation graph if and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds to a node in the graph, and every node in the graph  corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue.
A protocol P is a function on a sequence of moves mi in a dialogue D that , for all i ≥ 0 , identifies a set of possible moves Mi+1 from which the mi+1th move may be drawn : P : mi → Mi+1 In other words , for our purposes here , at every point in a dialogue ,
