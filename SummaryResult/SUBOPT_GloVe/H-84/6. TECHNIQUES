We will also use average cosine similarity between two events as a feature and it is defined as follows.
In many text clustering systems, the similarity between two  stories is the inner product of their tf-idf vectors, hence we use it as one of our features.
We have three different ways to compute the similarity between two events Ù and Ú : ¯ Average link : In this case the similarity is the average of the similarities of all pairs of stories between Ù and Ú as shown below : × Ñ´ Ù Ú µ È×Ù¾ Ù È×Ú¾ Ú ×
