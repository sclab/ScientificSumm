In this work, we attempt to capture the rich structure of events and their dependencies in a news topic through our event models.
We formally define the novel problem, suggest evaluation  metrics and present a few techniques for solving the problem.
Our  experiments on a manually labeled data sets show that our models  effectively identify the events and capture dependencies among them.
We call the process of recognizing events and their dependencies event threading.
With the overwhelming volume of online news available today , there is an increasing need for automatic techniques to analyze and present news to the user
