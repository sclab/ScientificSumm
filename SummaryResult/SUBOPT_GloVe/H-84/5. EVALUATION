Ê È´ ¼´× µ ¼´× µ ´× µ ´× µµ ´Åµ ´Å¼µ ´Åµ (8) ¯ Dependency Precision(DP): It is the probability that there is a dependency between the events of two randomly selected stories × and × in the true model Å given that they have a dependency in the system model Å¼.
Note that the direction of dependency is important in comparison.
A system can generate some event model Å¼ ´ ¼ ¼µ using certain algorithms, which is usually different from the truth model Å ´ µ (we assume the annotator did not make any  mistake).
