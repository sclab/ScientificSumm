Equation (2) is the ad relevance model that we consider in this paper, with unknown parameters P(Cj|q) for each query q.
We assume that P(q|Cj, d) â‰ˆ P(q|d), that is, a  probability of a query given a document can be determined without knowing the class of the query.
While P(d|q) is harder to compute, we consider the underlying relevance model for ranking documents given a query.
We assume that a person searches an ad a by constructing a query q : the person first picks a concept Cj according to the weights P ( Cj|a )
