Compared to this approach, we solved the problem of  document classification directly in the target taxonomy by  using the queries to produce document classifier as described in Section 2.
Studies in the field pursue different approaches for  obtaining additional information about the queries.
However, the sheer volume of queries nowadays does not lend itself to manual supervision, and hence subsequent works focused on blind relevance feedback, which basically assumes top returned results to be relevant [23, 12, 4, 14].
Thus , Web documents were first classified with respect to the ODP hierarchy , and their classifications were subsequently mapped to
