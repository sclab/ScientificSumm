While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each user"s trades is not observable; this  depends on the details of the market process.
With real inputs and arbitrary prior  distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 
Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.
In this section , we discuss the applicability of these results
