In this paper, we investigate the nature of the  computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information  markets.
As a result, market prices  encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all  information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.
The process of information incorporation is, at its essence, a distributed computation.
To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an  information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.
Over time , if the
