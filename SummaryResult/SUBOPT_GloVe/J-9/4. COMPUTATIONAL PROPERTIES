It follows that the clearing price in round r is given by pr = 1 n n i=1 (h (0) i + dixi) (4) All the agents already know all the h (0) i and di values, and they observe the price pr at the end of the rth round.
It is possible that the equilibrium price p∞ of the security F will not be either 0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it.
, p∞ n ) is common knowledge , then it must be the case that p∞ 1 = p∞ 2
