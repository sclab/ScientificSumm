A more satisfying approach would be to  assume only rationality and solve for the resulting  gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current  computational model or another model of an information market.
Some  interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: â€¢ The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have  assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.
In a sense, some of the computation  itself is distributed among the participating agents, but can the market computation also be distributed?
It is interesting to ask whether
