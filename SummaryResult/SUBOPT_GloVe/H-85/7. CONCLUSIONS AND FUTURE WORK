The predicted relevance preferences can be used for automatic relevance evaluation and tuning, for deploying search in new settings, and ultimately for improving the overall web search experience. 
For example, our automatically derived behavior models could be trained on examples of search abuse or click spam behavior instead of relevance labels.
Query distributions also change over time, and it would be productive to investigate how that affects the predictive ability of these models.
For example, queries with divergent access patterns (e.g., for ambiguous queries with multiple meanings) may result in behavior inconsistent with the model learned for all queries.
