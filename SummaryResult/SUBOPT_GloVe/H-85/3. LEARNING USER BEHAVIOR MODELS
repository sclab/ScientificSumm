Hence, in addition to basic features, which we will describe in detail in Section 3.2, we compute derived features that measure the deviation of the observed feature value for a given search result from the expected values for a result, with no query-dependent information.
This reflects the fact that search engines do a reasonable job of ranking results as well as biases to click top results and  noisewe attempt to separate these components in the analysis that follows.
To model this aspect of user experience we defined features to characterize the nature of the query and its relation to the
