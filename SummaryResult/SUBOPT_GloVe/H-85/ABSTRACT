We generalize our approach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough, which results in higher preference prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone.
We present a real-world study of modeling the behavior of web search users to predict web search result preferences.
We report results of a large-scale experimental evaluation that show substantial improvements over published implicit feedback interpretation methods.
Accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking, click spam detection, web search personalization, and other tasks.
Evaluating user preferences of web search results is crucial for search engine development, deployment, and maintenance.
