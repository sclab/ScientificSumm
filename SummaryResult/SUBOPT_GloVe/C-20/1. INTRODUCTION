When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization  framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.
In the LAN environment, these  technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.
Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.
