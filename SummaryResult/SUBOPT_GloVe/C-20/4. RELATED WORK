At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate  applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without  application downtimes [15].
As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.
Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.
In the context of network support , our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [ 2 ] , which
