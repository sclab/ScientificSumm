Our approach to addressing the networking requirements for live WAN migration builds on the observations that not all networking changes in this approach are time critical and further that  instantaneous changes are best achieved in a localized manner.
Specifically, to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers is performed via asynchronous replication to  benefit from the efficiency of that mode of operation.
However , because the local and remote systems are allowed to diverge , asynchronous replication always involves some data loss in the event of a
