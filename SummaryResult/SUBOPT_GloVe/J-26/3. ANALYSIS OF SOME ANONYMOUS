While in the AND technology the POU for n = 2 is not bounded from above (for γ → 0), the highest POU in OR technology with two agents is 2 (for γ → 0).
7 AND technology with any number of agents n and any γ , and any identical cost c. 8 v∗ is a function of n , γ , c. 23 • the price of unaccountability is obtained at the transition point of the agency case , and is POU = ` 1 γ − 1 ´n−1 + ( 1 − γ 1 − γ ) Proof
