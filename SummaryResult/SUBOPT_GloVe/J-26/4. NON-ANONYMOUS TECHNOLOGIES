S ∈ S. Now we are left to show that at vS, the set S yields a higher utility than any other set Z ∈ S. The construction of t(Z) ensures this since the marginal contribution of each agent in Z is such a small , that the payment is too high for the set to be optimal.
This completes the definition of t. We show that each admissible set S ∈ S is optimal at the value vS = ck 2 2 S .
The optimal contract for f for some v , denoted by S , is composed of some
