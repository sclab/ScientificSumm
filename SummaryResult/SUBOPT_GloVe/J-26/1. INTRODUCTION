1.3 Our Results 1 One could think of a different model in which the agents have intrinsic utility from the outcome and payments may not be needed, as in [10, 11].
3 However, some of the more advanced questions we ask for this case can be viewed as instances of the general model.
The main part of the specification of a problem in this model is a function that specifies this distribution for each n-tuple of agents" actions.
1.2 Our Models We start by presenting a general model : in this model each of n agents has a set
