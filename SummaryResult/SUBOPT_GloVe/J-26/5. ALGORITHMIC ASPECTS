Given as input a black box for a success function t (when the costs are identical), and a value v, the number of queries that is needed, in the worst case, to find the optimal contract is exponential in n. Proof.
By choosing γx close enough to 1 2 , we can make sure that player x will enter the optimal contract only for very large values of v , after all other agents are contracted ( if we can find the optimal contract for any value , it is easy to find a value for which in the original
