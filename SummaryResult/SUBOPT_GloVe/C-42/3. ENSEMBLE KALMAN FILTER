When the available number of licenses is less than the number of models in the ensemble, one or more of the nodes in the MPI group have to handle more than one model in a serial fashion and therefore, it takes longer to complete the simulation.
For accurate performance forecasting of the field, it is necessary to reconcile several geological models to the dynamic response of the field through history matching [16-20].
Historical production response of the field for over 50 years is used in these simulations.
At the end of iteration , the master/control process collects the output files
