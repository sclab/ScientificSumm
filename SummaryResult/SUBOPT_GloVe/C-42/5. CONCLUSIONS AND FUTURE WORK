Towards the future work, it would be interesting to compare the runtime between MPI, and Grid implementations for the EnKF application.
This approach has several advantages over MPI implementation especially when a site specific cluster is heavily loaded and/or the number licenses required for the simulation is more than those available at a single site.
Another aspect of interest in the near future would be managing both compute and license resources to address the job (or processor)-to-license ratio management. 
This effort could shed light on quality of service (QoS) of Grid environments in comparison with cluster computing.
