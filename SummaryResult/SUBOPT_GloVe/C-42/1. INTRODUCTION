The overall goal of TIGRE is to support local, campus and regional user interests and offer avenues to connect with national Grid projects such as Open Science Grid [5], and TeraGrid [6].
The goal of HiPCAT is to support advanced computational technologies to enhance research, development, and educational activities.
Application description and the need for Grid-enabling EnKF methodology is provided in Section 3.
Within the energy exploration strategic application area , we have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman Filter ( EnKF ) [ 7 ] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the
