If a balance bound requires negative information revelation in one LOGIC category then α will contribute nothing to it, and will leave this to the natural decay to the reputation D as described above. 
This is achieved by increasing the value of s in Equation 1.
Following from Equation 5 , α will want to achieve a negotiation target , Nβ ( Ψt ) such that : ν · Nβ ( Ψt ) + ( 1 − ν ) · V ∗t β is a bit on the T∗t β side of V ∗t β : Nβ ( Ψt )
