To simulate a realistic scenario, we use the first 6 (3) weeks of the query stream for computing query term frequencies and the following 9 (12) weeks to estimate the hit rate.
We measured the effect on the QtfDf algorithm of the changes in a 15-week query stream (Figure 14).
To support this claim, we first assess how topics change comparing the distribution of queries from the first week in June, 2006, to the  distribution of queries for the remainder of 2006 that did not appear in the first week in June.
After a small decay in hit rate values
