As posting lists have variable size, caching them dynamically is not very efficient, due to the complexity in terms of  efficiency and space, and the skewed distribution of the query stream, as shown later.
We provide a framework for the analysis of the trade-off between static caching of query answers and posting lists; â€¢ Static caching of terms can be more effective than  dynamic caching with, for example, LRU.
Often the whole set of posting lists does not fit in memory , and consequently , the engine has to select a small set to keep in memory and speed up
