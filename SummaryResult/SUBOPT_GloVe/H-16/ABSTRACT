Using a query log spanning a whole year we explore the  limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching posting lists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query  answers.
We also study the problem of finding the optimal way to split the static cache between answers and posting lists.
In this paper we study the trade-offs in designing efficient caching systems for Web search engines.
Finally, we measure how the changes in the query log affect the  effectiveness of static caching, given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time.
We explore the impact of
