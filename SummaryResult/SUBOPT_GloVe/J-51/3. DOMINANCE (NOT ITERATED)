Moreover, if this linear program has a solution with objective value < 1, there is a mixed strategy strictly dominating σ∗ r , which can be obtained by taking the LP solution and adding the remaining probability to any strategy (because all the utilities are positive, this will add to the left side of any inequality, so all inequalities will  become strict).
This is because for iterated dominance, we need to look at the dominated strategies of each individual player, so we cannot merge any players.
If σ∗ r is strictly dominated by some mixed strategy , this linear program has
