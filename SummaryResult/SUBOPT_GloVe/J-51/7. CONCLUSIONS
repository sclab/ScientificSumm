Finally, we can ask whether some of the algorithms we described (such as the one for iterated strict dominance with mixed strategies) can be made faster. 
First, there is the open question of whether it is possible to complete iterated dominance in Bayesian games in polynomial time (even though we showed that an exponential number of  alternations between the players in eliminating strategies is sometimes required).
We showed that , unlike in normal form games , deciding whether a given pure strategy is dominated by another pure strategy in a Bayesian game is NP-complete ( both with strict and weak
