In this paper, we study some fundamental computational questions concerning dominance and iterated dominance,  including how hard it is to check whether a given strategy can be eliminated by each of the variants of these notions.
( After an early short paper on an easy case [ 11 ] , the main computational study of these concepts has actually taken place in a paper in the game theory community [ 7 ] .1 ) A strategy strictly dominates another strategy if it performs strictly 1 This is not to say that computer scientists have ignored 88 better against all vectors
