We will show that ql , al and xi = P j∈Q z1 ij are feasible for (7) with the same  objective value.
In fact, every pure strategy j in Problem (5) corresponds to a sequence of pure  strategies jl, one for each follower l ∈ L. This means that qj = 1 if and only if ql jl = 1 for all l ∈ L. In addition, given the a  priori probabilities pl of facing player l, the reward in the Harsanyi transformation payoff table is Rij = P l∈L pl Rl ijl .
Using this modified notation , we characterize the optimal solution of
