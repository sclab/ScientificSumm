The problem of choosing an optimal strategy for the leader to commit to in a Stackelberg game is analyzed in [5] and found to be NP-hard in the case of a Bayesian game with multiple types of followers.
In addition, since the Nash equilibrium assumes a simultaneous choice of strategies, the advantages of being the leader are not considered.
In this case, the leader now has an  incentive to deviate and choose a pure strategy of 2 (to get a payoff of 5).
In a Stackelberg game , a leader commits to a strategy first , and then a follower
