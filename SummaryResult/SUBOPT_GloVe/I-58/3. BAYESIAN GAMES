Using these values we construct a base payoff table as the payoff for the game against robber type a.
Since there are two types assumed (denoted as a and b), we construct two payoff tables (shown in Table 2) corresponding to the security agent playing a separate game with each of the two robber types with probabilities α and 1 − α.
Given the common  assumption, taken in [5], in the case where followers are indifferent, they will choose the strategy that benefits the leader, there must exist a guaranteed optimal strategy for the leader [5].
