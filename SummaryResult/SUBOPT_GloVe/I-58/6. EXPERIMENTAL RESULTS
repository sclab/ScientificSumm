The third set of graphs, shown in Figure 3 shows the effect of the multiset size on runtime in seconds (left column) and reward (right column), again expressed as the reward received by the security agent in the patrolling game, and not a percentage of the optimal Figure 2: Reward for various algorithms on problems of 3 and 4 houses.
The payoff tables for additional robber types are constructed and added to the game by adding a random distribution of varying size to the payoffs in the base case.
This reward is the utility received by the security agent in
