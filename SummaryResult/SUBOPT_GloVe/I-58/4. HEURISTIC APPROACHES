(2) The objective function maximizes the follower"s expected reward given x, while the constraints make feasible any mixed strategy q for the follower.
(3) From strong duality and complementary slackness we obtain that the follower"s maximum reward value, a, is the value of every pure strategy with qj > 0, that is in the support of the optimal mixed strategy.
( 4 ) Problem ( 4 ) maximizes the leader '' s reward with the follower '' s best response ( qj for fixed leader '' s policy x and hence denoted q ( x ) j
