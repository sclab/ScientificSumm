In addition, we plan to revisit the service APIs for a Grid Service Discovery solution leveraging the available solutions and specifications as well as the work presented in this paper. 
The paper has solved the scalability issues with UDDI but does not preclude the application of this approach to other service discovery mechanisms.
Furthermore, we plan to investigate other aspects of grid service discovery that extend this work.
Based on initial prototype testing, we believe that DUDE architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling issues.
