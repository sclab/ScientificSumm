To support this efficiently in the DHT, our proxy registries have to take prefixes of the service name of varying length and publish the URI and UDDI key multiple times, once using each prefix.
Since this can lead to load-imbalance, a better solution might be to use the DHT only to get a list of all UDDI registries, and send the search to all of them in the locations to be searched.
The results may include a few services from each of the juddi registries.
This ensures that when the proxy registry queries for services with a certain name ,
