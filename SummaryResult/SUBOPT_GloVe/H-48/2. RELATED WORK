The work most similar to our own in the literature consists of work in which document collections or queries are altered in a systematic way to measure differences query  performance.
By  purposely inducing mismatch between the terms in queries and relevant documents, our evaluation framework allows us a controlled manner in which to degrade the quality of the queries with respect to their relevant documents, and then to measure the both the degree of (induced) difficulty of the query and the degree to which QE improves the retrieval performance of the degraded query.
