The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a  necessary condition for truthfulness.
This question is of the following general type: given a class of functions (here, social choice functions) and a  property that holds for some of them (here, truthfulness),  characterize the property.
In this paper we assume that the range A is finite and that each player '' s
