Therefore S a∈A Da = D. Also, by proposition 5, any point v in Da ∩ Db satisfies v(a) − v(b) = δab = −δba. 
Finally, we restrict the collection of sets {Ra : a ∈ A} to the domain D by defining Da = Ra ∩ D for each a ∈ A.
Let a, b ∈ A.
v ∈ Ra implies v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab and v ∈ Rb implies v(b)−v(a) ≥ δba which, by the nonnegative two-cycle property, implies v(a) − v(b) ≤ δab.
Thus v ( a ) − v ( b
