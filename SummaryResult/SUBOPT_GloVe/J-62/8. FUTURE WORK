It is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set D of real  matrices is a WM-domain.
Roberts" theorem says that the unrestricted domain is an AM-domain.
What are the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is an AM-domain?
In this paper, we showed that for finite A, any convex D is a WM-domain.
We believe that convexity is the main part of the story, i.e., a WM-domain is, after excluding some exceptional cases, essentially a convex set.
As stated in the introduction , the goal underlying the work in this
