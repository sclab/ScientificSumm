Our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and an n Ã— n matrix M satisfying the following properties: (1) M is non-singular.
, ik be a  sequence of indices satisfying property 3 of M. We claim ei1 ei2 .
It is easy to see that D is a convex subset of the set of all functions from Sn to R. The outcome graph Gf is an infinite graph whose vertex set is the outcome set A = Sn.
Next we show that Gf has a negative cycle.
The domain is the boundary of a triangle whose vertices are x =
