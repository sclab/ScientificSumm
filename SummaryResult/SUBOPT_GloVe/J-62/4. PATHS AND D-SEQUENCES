For v, w ∈ D and b, c ∈ A, we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Svw .
By the definition of a compatible pair, ui ∈ Dai ∩ Dai+1 for i ∈ [k − 1].
Let b, c ∈ A and let −→a , −→a ∈ Pbc.
We write C(−→a ) for the set of D-sequences −→u that are compatible with −→a .
D-sequence ( v , w , x , y , z ) is compatible with both path ( a , b , c ,
