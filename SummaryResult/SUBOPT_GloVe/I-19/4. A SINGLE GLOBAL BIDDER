Figure 1 illustrates the optimal global bids and the corresponding expected  utility for various M and N = 5, but again the bid curves for different values of M and N follow a very similar pattern.
To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single  secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.
Proof To prove this , we first show that G ( · ) and F ( · ) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is
