Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the presence of a global bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case the local bidders are static.
On the other hand, as a result of the uncertainty concerning the actual number of bidders, a global bidder is more likely to win multiple items (we confirmed this  analytically).
Note that a degree of inefficiency is inherent to a multiauction market with only local bidders [ 2 ] .9 For example , if there are two auctions selling one item each , and the two bidders with the highest valuations both bid locally
