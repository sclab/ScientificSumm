The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.
For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.
Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with  multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.
For this setting , we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item , even when a bidder only requires
