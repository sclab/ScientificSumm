This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.
In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.
Thus, our simulation can be used as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the  optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect a combination of local and global bidders.
