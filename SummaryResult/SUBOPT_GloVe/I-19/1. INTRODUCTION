In Section 4 we  investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise the optimal bidding behaviour for it.
To date, much of the existing literature on multiple  auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on  simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).
To this end , in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely , an agent that participates in multiple , concurrent (
