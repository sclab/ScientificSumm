Given the sensors" observational uncertainty, the targets" uncertain transitions and the distributed nature of the sensor nodes, these sensor nets provide a useful domains for applying distributed POMDP models.
Figure 1 shows a specific problem instance within this type consisting of three sensors.
We assume that there are two independent targets and that each target"s movement is uncertain and unaffected by the sensor agents.
Distributed sensor networks are a large, important class of  domains that motivate our work.
This paper focuses on a set of target tracking problems that arise in certain types of sensor networks
