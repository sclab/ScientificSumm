The expected value for this joint policy is used to prune out the nodes in level 2 (the ones with upper bounds < 234) When creating policies for each non-leaf agent i, SPIDER  potentially performs two steps: 1.
This best response computation for a non-leaf agent i includes: (a)  Sorting of policies (in descending order) based on heuristic values on line 11; (b) Computing best response policies at each of the  children for fixed policies of agent i in lines 16-20; and (c) Maintaining 824 The Sixth Intl.
To reiterate this in terms of the agents in DFS tree interaction structure
