For example, for the recommendation system game, a highly compact  representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products, and let the algorithms that operate on the representation to compute the values of coalitions  appropriately.
Our work extends and generalizes the representation schemes in [3, 4] through decomposing the game into a set of rules that assign marginal contributions to groups of agents.
Unfortunately, given that the number of degrees of  freedom of coalitional games is O(2n ), not all games can be  represented concisely using a single scheme due to information theoretic constraints.
