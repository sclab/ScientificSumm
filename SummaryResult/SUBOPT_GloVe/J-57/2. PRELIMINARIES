For example, it will not be able to represent the majority game, where a group of agents S will have value of 1 if and only if s > n/2.
For a game to have a non-empty core, it must satisfy the property of balancedness, defined as follows.
On the other hand, there is an efficient algorithm for  computing the Shapley value of the game, and for determining whether the core is empty under the restriction of positive edge weights.
For computing the Shapley value , the authors showed that the complexity is linear in the input description ; in particular
