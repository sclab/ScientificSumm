Core-Membership in MC-nets is in the class of coNP since any set of agents S of which v(S) > x(S) will serve as a certificate to show that x does not belong to the core.
On the other hand, the dual of the program has only n variables, and can be written as follows: minimize x∈Rn n i=1 xi subject to x(S) ≥ v(S), ∀S ⊆ N (7) By strong duality, optimal value of (7) is equal to  optimal value of (4), the primal program described in section 2.
Note that a simple extension to the Core-Membership
