Along the line of exploiting symmetry, as the agents within the same class are symmetric with respect to each other, we can extend the idea above by allowing functional description of marginal contributions.
We have developed a fully expressive representation scheme for coalitional games of which the size depends on the  complexity of the interactions among the agents.
Other than the algorithm for Core-Non-Emptiness in [ 4 ] under the restriction of non-negative edge weights , and that in [ 2 ] for superadditive games when the value of the grand coalition is given , we are not aware of
