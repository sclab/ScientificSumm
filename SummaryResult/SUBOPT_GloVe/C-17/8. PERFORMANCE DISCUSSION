3) is withholding all the streams that have less value of LN compared to the least of the three in the set F. We can find the correct and unique three streams after a few time slots depending on the transportation delay between the domains.
Evidently, the chances that the next two dominant streams of that domain being selected to F in the next packet period are less.
As each M-CS from a domain will be sending only NMax out of d M packets to the other CSs ( MaxN d M > > ) , the bandwidth used by
