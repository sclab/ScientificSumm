The utility of this allocation is k. Similarly, if there is a solution for the STAP with the utility value k, and the allocated task set is N, then for the IS problem, there exists a maximum independent set N of size k in G. An example can be found in Figure 1.
We now show that the TAP with an arbitrary social  network is also NP-complete, even when the utility of each task is 1, and the quantity of all required and available resources is 1.
Given an instance of the problem and an integer k , we can
