Each task t ∈ T can only be allocated to agents that are (direct) neighbors of agent loc(t) in the social network SN.
Given a set of agents A connected by a social network SN = (A, AE), and a finite set of tasks T , the social task allocation problem (or STAP for short) is the problem of finding the efficient task allocation φ, such that φ is valid and the social welfare Uφ is maximized. 
Each task t ∈ T is then defined by a tuple u ( t ) , rsc ( t ) , loc ( t
