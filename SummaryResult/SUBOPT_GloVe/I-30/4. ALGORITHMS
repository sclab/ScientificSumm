If the maximum flow is equal to the sum of all  resources required by the subset of tasks, we know that a  feasible solution exists (see Algorithm 2).
This protocol is such that, when no two tasks have exactly the same  efficiency, in every iteration at least one task is removed from a task list.1 From this the computation and communication property of the algorithm follows.
A bid consists of all the resources the agent is able to supply for this task.
Note that the set of valid allocations in P is only a subset of the set of valid
