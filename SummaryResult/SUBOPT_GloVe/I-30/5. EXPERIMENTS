We also notice from the graph that the solution quality of the GDAP on all three networks is quite high (over 0.8) when the available resource is very limited (0.3).
5.2.2 Experiment 2 To study the robustness of the GDAP against different problem settings, we generate instances where the task  benefit distribution is different: 40% of the tasks gets a 10 times higher benefit (as described in Setting 2).
in social networks with a low average degree.2 Since the solution quality clearly depends on the resource ratio as well as on the degree of the social network , we study
