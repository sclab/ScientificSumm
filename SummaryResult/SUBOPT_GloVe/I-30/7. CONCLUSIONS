Finally, it would be interesting to study real-life instances of the social task allocation problem, and see how they  relate to the randomly generated networks of different types studied in this paper.
We are  interested in seeing how such interactions will affect the  performance of task allocation in different social networks.
Finally, we used the optimal solution and the upper-bound (for larger instances) to conduct an  extensive set of experiments to assess the solution quality and the computational efficiency of the proposed distributed  algorithm in different types of networks, namely, small-world networks, random networks, and scale-free networks.
A third interesting
