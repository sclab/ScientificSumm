Although the cores are running  independently and in parallel, a crude local fusion module integrates them by shutting down those cores which missed their events after a reasonable timeout and by generating a single  detection message towards the mote.
Therefore, the real challenge for the matching detection core is to identify the first and second half periods properly.
Both events are transient by their nature and present very intense stimuli to the microphones.
If too much garbage is discarded in the collection phases , the core resets itself to prevent the ( false ) detection of the halves from completely
