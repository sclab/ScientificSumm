The FPGA configuration (2.5 V) and a separate 3.3 V power net are fed by low current LDOs, the latter one is used to provide independent power to the mote and to the Bluetooth radio.
Some of these nodes were mounted on military kevlar helmets with the microphones directly attached to the  surface at about 20 cm separation as shown in Figure 3(a).
An RS232 port and a Bluetooth (BlueGiga WT12) wireless link with virtual UART emulation are directly available on the board and provide simple means to connect the sensor to PCs and PDAs.
