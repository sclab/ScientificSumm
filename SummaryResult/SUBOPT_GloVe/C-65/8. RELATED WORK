The problem with this and similar centralized  systems is the need of the one or handful of microphone arrays to be in line-of-sight of the shooter.
Researchers at BBN have developed the Bullet Ears system [3] which has the capability to be installed in a fixed position or worn by soldiers.
The area has a close  relevance to the topic of supersonic flow mechanics [20].
The edges of the shockwave are typically well defined and the shockwave length is directly related to the bullet  characteristics.
The soldier-worn system has 12 microphones as well as a GPS antenna and orientation sensors
