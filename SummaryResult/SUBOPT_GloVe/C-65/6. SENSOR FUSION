For each ToA, we can calculate the corresponding time of the shot, since the origin is assumed to be in box B.
It is shown below that these measurements are sufficient to compute the position of the shooter (P).
Since u and v are not used separately only uv, the absolute orientation of the sensor can be arbitrary, we still get t which gives us the range.
The trajectories in the core set are then averaged to get the final trajectory.
Once the trajectory is known, the speed can be calculated for each sensor based on the shockwave geometry.
