The shockwave has a characteristic shape resembling a capital N. The rise time at both the start and end of the signal is very fast, under 1 Î¼sec.
The sensorfusion  algorithm and the user interface get their data through one of these channels.
However, the sensorboards are also connected to COTS MICAz motes and they share their AoA and ToA measurements, as well as their own location and orientation, with each other using a multihop routing service [9].
The firing of a typical military rifle, such as the AK47 or M16, produces two distinct acoustic phenomena.
Currently the system assumes
