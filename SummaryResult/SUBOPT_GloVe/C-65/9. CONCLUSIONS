Second, the performance of the system when used in  standalone mode, that is, when single sensors alone provided localization, was also very good.
The system proved to be very robust when increasing the node location and orientation errors and decreasing the number of available sensors all the way down to a couple.
We believe that with the lessons learned in the test , a consecutive field experiment could have showed significantly improved results especially in range estimation beyond 100 m and weapon classification for the remaining two weapons that were mistaken for each other the majority of the times during
