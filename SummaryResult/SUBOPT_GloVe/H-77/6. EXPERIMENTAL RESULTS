Table 1 shows the percentages of the documents having titles.
Contingence table with regard to title extraction Is title Is not title Extracted A B Not extracted C D 6.2 Baselines We test the accuracies of the two baselines described in section 4.2.
The results indicate that the improvements of machine learning over baselines are statistically significant (in the sense p-value < 0.05) Table 6.
Thus, it is safe to say that the use of extracted title can indeed improve the precision of document retrieval. 
Figure 10 shows different document retrieval results with different ranking functions in terms of precision @
