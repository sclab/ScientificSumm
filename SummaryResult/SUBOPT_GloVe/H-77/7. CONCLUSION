In this paper, we showed that the approach can work for extraction from general documents as well.
We also attempted to use the extracted titles in document retrieval.
All the above investigations were not conducted in previous work, and through our investigations we verified the generality and the significance of the title extraction approach. 
In this paper, we have investigated the problem of automatically extracting titles from general documents.
Our experimental results indicated that the machine learning approach can work significantly better than the baselines in title extraction from Office documents.
Previous work showed that the machine learning approach can
