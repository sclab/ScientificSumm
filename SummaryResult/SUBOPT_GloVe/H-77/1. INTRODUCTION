(2) We have empirically verified that the models trained with our approach are generic in the sense that they can be trained on one domain and applied to another, and they can be trained in one language and applied to another.
( 1 ) Comparison between models : among the models above , which model performs best for title extraction ; ( 2 ) Generality of model : whether it is possible to train a model on one domain and apply it to another domain , and whether it is possible to train a model in one language and apply
