As another research direction we are exploring methods for extending our predictions to the previously unseen queries (e.g., query clustering), which should further improve the web search experience of users.
Our experiments showed significant improvement over methods that do not consider implicit feedback.
The gains are particularly dramatic for the top K=1 result in the final ranking, with precision improvements as high as 31%, and the gains are substantial for all values of K. Our experiments showed that implicit user feedback can further improve web search performance, when incorporated directly with popular content- and link-based features.
Interestingly , implicit feedback
