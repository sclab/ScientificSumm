Hence, we will also use RankNet as a generic ranker to explore the contribution of implicit feedback for different ranking alternatives. 
The main reason for ignoring the original scores is that since the feature spaces and learning algorithms are different, the scores are not directly comparable, and re-normalization tends to remove the benefit of incorporating classifier scores.
For a given query q, the implicit score ISd is computed for each result d from available user interaction features, resulting in the implicit rank Id for each result.
We use a 2-layer implementation of RankNet in order to model non-linear relationships between
