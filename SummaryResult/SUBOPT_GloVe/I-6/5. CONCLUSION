We discussed the properties of our framework showing how it can be used as a powerful communication-inherent mechanism for rewarding and sanctioning agent behaviour in open systems without compromising agent autonomy,  discussed its integration with agents" planning processes,  complexity issues, and presented a list of desiderata for the  design of ACLs with such semantics.
This paper introduces dynamic semantics for ACLs as a method for dealing with some fundamental problems of agent communication in open systems , the simple underlying idea being that different courses of agent behaviour can give rise to different interpretations of meaning of the messages
