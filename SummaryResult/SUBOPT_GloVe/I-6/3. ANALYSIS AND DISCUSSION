The main strength of our framework is that it allows us to exploit the three main elements of reciprocity: • Reputation-based adaptation: The DS adapts the  expectations toward agent i according to i"s previous  behaviour by modifying the semantic state to better  reflect this behaviour (based on the assumption that it will repeat itself in the future).
Compliance/deviance realisability : It must be possible for agents in principle to
