Recently, several new architectures have been proposed in the context of the Internet to provide the principal not only with a set of paths from which it can chose (like BGP does) but also with the performance along those paths and the network topology.
In addition, the current protocol does not have the  infrastructure to support implementation of direct contracts between endpoints and the network.
Another approach is to have the edge networks perform measurements and discover the network topology [32].
In this case , the principal ( e.g. , a multi-homed site or a tier-1 AS ) can implement
