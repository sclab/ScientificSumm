In addition, in scenarios of unknown transit costs, it is also possible to design mechanisms that induce cooperative behavior in equilibrium, but the sender pays a premium for extracting information from the  transit nodes.
We  conclude that monitoring per-hop outcomes may not improve the  utility of the participants or the network performace.
DIRECTIONS In this paper we show that in a multi-hop routing setting, where the actions of the intermediate nodes are hidden from the source 125 and/or destination, it is possible to design payment schemes to  induce cooperative behavior from the intermediate nodes.
We plan to study under what
