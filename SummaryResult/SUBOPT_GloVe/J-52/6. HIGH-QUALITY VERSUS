Therefore, it may be possible for the principal to  maximize its utility by contracting with only m of the n nodes along the path.
The proof is a direct outcome of the following  statements, which are proved above: 1.
Individual autonomous systems (AS"s) can either adopt hot-potato routing or early exit routing (a = 0), where a packet is handed off to the downstream AS at the first possible exit, or late exit routing (a = 1), where an AS carries the packet longer than it needs to, handing off the packet at an exit closer to the destination.
