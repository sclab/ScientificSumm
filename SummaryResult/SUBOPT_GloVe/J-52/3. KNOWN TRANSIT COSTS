Because the expected benefit when all nodes forward is the same under both scenarios, we only need to show that the expected total payment is identical as well.
We next prove that the expected payment to a node equals its expected cost in equilibrium.
Under the optimal contract that induces high-effort behavior from all intermediate nodes in the Nash  Equi118 librium2 , the expected payment to each node is the same as its  expected cost, with the following payment schedule: sB i = si(x = xB ) = 0 (2) sG i = si(x = xG ) = c (1 − k)n−i+1 (3) PROOF.
The expected
