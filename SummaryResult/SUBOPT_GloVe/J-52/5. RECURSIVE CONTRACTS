In recursive payment, the principal contracts with the first node on the path, which in turn contracts with the second, and so on, such that each node contracts with its downstream node and makes the payment based on the final result, as demonstrated in figure 6.
In order to calculate the expected total payment, we have to find the payment to the first node on the path that will  induce appropriate behavior.
For  example, in FPSS , the principal guarantees to pay each node an  expected payment of pi > ci.
When the principal comes to design a contract with node A
