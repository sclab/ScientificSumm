Third, we show that in the absence of a priori information about transit costs on the packet forwarding path, it is possible to generalize existing mechanisms to overcome scenarios that involve both hidden-information and hidden-action.
First, we show that it is possible to design contracts to induce cooperation when intermediate nodes can choose to forward or drop packets, as well as when the nodes can choose to forward packets with different levels of quality of service.
However, the actions of the intermediate nodes are often hidden from the endpoints.
In many cases , the endpoints can only observe whether or
