We show that our model can be applied to both scenarios with known and  unknown topologies and costs, and highlight the implications of each scenario in the context of contracts.
In Section 3 we consider agents who decide whether to drop or forward  packets with and without monitoring when the transit costs are common knowledge.
In other routing  scenarios, the sender does not have this a priori information.
The outcome is a function of the vector of actions taken by the agents on the path , a = ( a1 , ... , an ) âˆˆ { 0 , 1
