I-DIDs generalize DIDs, which may be viewed as graphical representations of POMDPs, to multiagent settings in the same way that I-POMDPs generalize POMDPs.
These graphical models called interactive dynamic influence diagrams (I-DIDs) seek to explicitly model the structure that is often present in real-world problems by decomposing the  situation into chance and decision variables, and the dependencies  between the variables.
We develop a new graphical representation for interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs) that is  significantly more transparent and semantically clear than the previous representation.
I-DIDs may be used to compute the policy of an agent online as the
