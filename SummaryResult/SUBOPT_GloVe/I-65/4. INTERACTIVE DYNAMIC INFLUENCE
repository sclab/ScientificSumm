Consequently, each of j"s subintentional or level 0  models (represented using a standard DID) in the first time step must be solved to obtain its optimal set of actions.
We adopt a two-phase approach: Given an I-ID of level l (described previously in Section 3) with all lower level models also represented as I-IDs or IDs (if level 0), the first step is to expand the level l I-ID over T time steps adding the dependency links and the conditional probability tables for each node.
The probability that j '' s updated model is , say mt+1,1 j
