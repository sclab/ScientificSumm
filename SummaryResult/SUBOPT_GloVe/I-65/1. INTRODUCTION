I-DIDs address this gap by allowing the representation of other agents" models as the values of a special model node.
They generalize POMDPs [13] to multiagent settings by including the other agents" computable models in the state space along with the states of the physical environment.
In the previous representation of the I-DID, the update of the agent"s belief over the models of others as the agents act and receive observations was denoted using a  special link called the model update link that connected the model nodes over time.
MAIDs provide an alternative to normal and
