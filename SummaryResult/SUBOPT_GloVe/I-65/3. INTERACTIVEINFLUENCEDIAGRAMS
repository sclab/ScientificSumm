Given the distributions over the actions within the different chance nodes (one for each model of the other agent), the level 1 I-ID is transformed as shown in Fig.
node, I-IDs differ from IDs by having a dashed link (called the policy link in [15]) between the model node and a chance node, Aj, that represents the distribution over the other agent"s actions given its model.
In particular, some of the models within the node are I-IDs that when solved generate the agent"s optimal policy in their decision nodes.
Because the model node contains the alternative
