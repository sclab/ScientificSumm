As we mentioned in the introduction, a number of prediction techniques have been proposed recently that focus on  contentbased queries in the topical relevance (ad-hoc) task.
Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].
[7] proposed four measures to capture the geometry of the top retrieved documents for prediction.
Next we review some representative models.
In fact , most of the successful
