From Table 8 We can see that in terms of prediction accuracy WIG-2 (the WIG method with the automatic query classifier) is not only better than the first two cases, but also is close to WIG-3 where a perfect classifier is assumed.
We choose WIG to deal with this case because it shows good prediction accuracy for both types of queries in the previous section.
We make use of all of the queries for our two baselines, that is, the clarity score and the robustness score.
We divide the queries in the pool into classes : good ( better than
