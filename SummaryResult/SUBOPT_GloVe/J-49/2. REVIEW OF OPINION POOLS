Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open  discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.
However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to  apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often  impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional  independence of experts.
They are combined through various  mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability  distribution.
Using LinOP , the aggregate probability distribution is
