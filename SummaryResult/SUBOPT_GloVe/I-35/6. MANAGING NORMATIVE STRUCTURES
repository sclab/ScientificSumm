In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have  annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.
However , rather than computing the complement set of a substitution ( which can be an infinite set ) we propose to annotate the prohibition with the
