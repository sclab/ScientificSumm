We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a  generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic  content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.
The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently  combined for analysis.
As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance
