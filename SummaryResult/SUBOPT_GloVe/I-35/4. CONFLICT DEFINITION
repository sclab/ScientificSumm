However, in this paper we adopt the view of [7] in which the authors suggest that a deontic inconsistency arises when an action is simultaneously permitted and prohibited - since a  permission may not be acted upon, no real conflict occurs.
That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under Ïƒ.
