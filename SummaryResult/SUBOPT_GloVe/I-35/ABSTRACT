The distributed management of norms is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly  distributed computational realisations of normative models.
We then demonstrate that this algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS.
In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a  normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative positions  (obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents" actions.
Within a NS , conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency
