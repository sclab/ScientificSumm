We know from Definition 1, that the Shapley value for a player is the expectation (E) of its marginal contribution to a coalition that is chosen randomly.
The average marginal contribution is found in Step 3 - and this is the Shapley value for player i. THEOREM 1.
The marginal contribution of player i to this random sample is one if the total weight of the X players in the sample is greater than or equal to a = q −wi but less than b = q − (where is an inifinitesimally small quantity).
From this population of players we randomly draw samples
