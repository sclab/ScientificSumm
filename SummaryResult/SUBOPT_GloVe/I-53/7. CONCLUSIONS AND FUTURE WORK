In particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game is #P-complete.
Although this problem is, in general #P-complete, we show that there are some specific voting games for which the Shapley value can be determined in polynomial time and  characterise such games.
In this context, cooperative game theory offers a solution concept called the Shapley value.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique and fair.
However, its main problem is that, for many coalition games, the Shapley value cannot be determined in polynomial time.
Finally ,
