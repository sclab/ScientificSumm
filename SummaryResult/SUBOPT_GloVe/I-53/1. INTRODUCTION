By identifying such games, we show, for the first tme, when it is feasible to find the exact value and when it is not.
Moreover, in this work, one of the most extensively studied solution  concepts is the Shapley value [19].
Thus, our contribution lies in also in providing, for the first time, an analysis of the percentage error in the  approximate Shapley value.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique and fair (see Section 2.1 for a discussion of the property of fairness).
The first is to use generating
