It is possible for the marginal contribution of this player to be one if it joins a coalition in which the number of type 1 players is between zero and (q − 1)/w1.
In the same way, we obtain the Shapley value of the large party for the general case where ws > 1 as: ϕl = wl/ws /(m + 1) Now consider a small player.
This is because, if q ≤ wl, then the large party can win the election on its own without the need for a coalition.
Thus , out of the total ( m + 1 ) possible
