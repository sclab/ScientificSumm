Furthermore, they assume that the Shapley value of a component of a given coalition game is given by an oracle, and on the basis of this assumption aggregate these values to find the value for the overall game.
In order to overcome the computational complexity of finding the Shapley value, two main approaches have been proposed in the literature.
A method for finding the Shapley value was also proposed in [5].
The method we propose differs from this in that they define the Shapley value by treating a player '' s number of swings ( if a player can change
