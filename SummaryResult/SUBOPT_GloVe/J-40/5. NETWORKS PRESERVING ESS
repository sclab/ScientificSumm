We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).
By arguments similar to those following the proof of  Theorem 5.1, if we let G = {Kn}∞ n=0, each incumbent will have the same fitness and each mutant will have the same fitness.
Then via a standard Chernoff bound argument , one can show that with high probability , the fraction of mutants neighboring i and
