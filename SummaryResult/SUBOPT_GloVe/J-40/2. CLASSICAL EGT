In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a 1 − fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t, and call these organisms mutants.
A consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ESS, it must be the case that F(s|s) ≥ F(t|s), for all strategies t. This inequality means that s must be a best response to itself, and thus any ESS strategy s must also be a Nash equilibrium.
First we must of course generalize the definition of ESS to a
