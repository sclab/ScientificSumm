Theorem 5.3 stated that if s is a classical ESS, then for graphs where |En| ≥ n1+γ , for some γ > 0, and where each organism is labeled a mutant with probability , one edge must contract.
Similarly, in the proof of Theorem 6.2, observe that the only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself, which has fitness F(t|s).
6.2 Stronger Contraction for Individuals The model of Section 3 requires that for an edge (i, j) to contract, the fitness of i must be greater than the fitness of j.
If we assume that we adopt this notion of
