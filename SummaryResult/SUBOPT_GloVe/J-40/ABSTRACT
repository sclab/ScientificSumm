We generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), and show a pair of complementary results that  exhibit the power of randomization in our setting: subject to degree or edge density conditions, the classical ESS of any game are preserved when the graph is chosen randomly and the mutation set is chosen adversarially, or when the graph is chosen adversarially and the mutation set is chosen randomly.
We study a natural extension of classical evolutionary game theory to a setting in which pairwise interactions are  restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network.
We examine natural strengthenings
