In order to properly define an ESS for an infinite family of finite graphs in a way that recovers the classical definition asymptotically in the case of the family of complete graphs, we first must give a definition that restricts attention to  families of mutant vertices that are smaller than some invasion threshold n, yet remain some constant fraction of the  population.
We say that M is -linear if there exists an , > > 0 , such that for all sufficiently large n , n > |Mn| > n. We can now give our definition for a strategy to
