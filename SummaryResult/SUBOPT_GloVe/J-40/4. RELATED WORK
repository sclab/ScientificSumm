In these three works, the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to reproduce, and analyze properties of the graph that allow a strategy to overrun the population.
What sets our work apart is that the model we consider encompasses a significantly more general class of games and graph topologies.
The first assumes organisms interact according to a weighted, undirected graph.
The model we propose is more general than both of these, as it encompasses a larger class of graphs as well as a richer set of games.
Here again , one can see that our model is more general
