As it is shown in Figure 4, as agents search and share information from run 1 to run 40, they manage to increase the benefit of the system, by drastically reducing the number of messages.
Experiments show: (a) An effective tuning of the networks as time passes and more queries are posed to the network, even if agents maintain the models of a small percentage of their acquaintances.
Each run lasts a number of rounds that depends on the of queries and on the parameters that determine the dynamics of the network : To end a run , all queries
