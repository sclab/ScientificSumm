Specifically, the paper demonstrates through extensive performance experiments: (a) How networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" so as to provide requested information effectively, increasing the benefit and the efficiency of the system.
The presented method enables agents to keep records of acquaintances" interests, to advertise their information provision abilities to those that have a high interest on them, and to maintain indices for routing queries to those agents that have the requested information provision abilities.
(c) That the proposed tuning task manages to increase the efficiency of information searching and sharing in highly dynamic and large networks.
