This approach is based on the specification of agents as providers and needers: This is done by a plan-based  precomputation of information needs and provision abilities of agents.
Exploiting the models of other agents in the network, agents construct their view of the network which is being used for forming routing decisions.
Their work differs in the one reported here in the following aspects: First, it aims at optimizing communication, while the goal here is to tune the network for effective information sharing, reducing communication and increasing system"s benefit.
