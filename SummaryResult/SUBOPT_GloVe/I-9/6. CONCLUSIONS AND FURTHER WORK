Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of  linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing  capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.
Moreover, we  emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the  advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.
Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.
This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.
Our approach differs in bringing the
