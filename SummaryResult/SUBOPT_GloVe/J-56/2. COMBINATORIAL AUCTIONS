A robust solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution.
When items cannot be withdrawn from winning bidders, following the failure of another bidder to honor his bid, repair solutions are restricted to the set of bids whose items only include those in the bid(s) that were reneged upon.
Consider the example in Table 1 , and the optimal
