Backtracking may then occur for one of two reasons: we cannot extend the assignment to satisfy the given constraints, or the current  partial assignment cannot be associated with a repair solution whose cost of repair is less than Î² should a break occur.
Bids 1 and 3 cannot both succeed, since they both require item A, so a constraint is added precluding the assignment in which both variables take the value 1.
For each combination of brittle assignments in the break-set , a repair-set is required that comprises the set of variables whose values must change to
