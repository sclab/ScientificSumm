Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution reparability by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker.
We then examine the trade-off between robustness and revenue in  different economically motivated auction scenarios for different  constraints on the revenue of repair solutions.
We have called this the Bid-taker"s Exposure  Problem.
When faced with such unreliable bidders , it is preferable for the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a
