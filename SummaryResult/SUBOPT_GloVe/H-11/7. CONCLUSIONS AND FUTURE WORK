Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten recognition and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled. 
In this paper, we consider the image retrieval problem on a small, static, and closed-domain image data.
This information can be naturally used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm.
Using techniques from experimental  design, our algorithm finds the most informative images to label.
For Web image search , it is possible
