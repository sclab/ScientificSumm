The challenge is thus to  determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples.
It solicits the user"s relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the CBIR systems.
We discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of  images, which gives us the most amount of information.
The user"s labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and  irrelevant images.
Our algorithm is based
