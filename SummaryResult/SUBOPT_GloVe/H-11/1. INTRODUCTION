In statistics, the problem of selecting samples to label is typically referred to as experimental design.
In the worst case, all the top images labeled by the user may be positive and thus the standard classification techniques can not be applied due to the lack of negative examples.
Once the loss function is defined, we can select the most informative data points which are presented to the user for labeling.
Based on the observation that the closer to the SVM boundary an image is , the less reliable its classification is , SVM active learning selects those unlabeled images closest
