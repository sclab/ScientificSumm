The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental design are: • D-optimal design: determinant of Hsse.
2.2 Optimal Experimental Design We consider a linear regression model y = wT x + (1) where y is the observation, x is the independent variable, w is the weight vector and is an unknown error with zero mean.
Given a set of points A = {x1, x2, · · · , xm} in Rd , find a subset B = {z1, z2, · · · , zk} ⊂ A which contains the most  informative points.
Since the computation of the determinant
