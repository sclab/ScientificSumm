Then CTM calculates the first and second moment of these maps as a representation of the natural color image pixel distribution.
[15], which integrates the color and texture characteristics of the image in a compact form.
Note that, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we do not use all the unlabeled images in the database but only those within top 500 returns of previous iteration. 
The system ranks the images in database  according to some pre-defined distance metric and presents to the user the top ranked images.
They typical retrieval process is  outlined as follows: 1.
