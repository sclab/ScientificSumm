It is important to note that the automatic relevance  feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].
To exhibit the advantages of using our algorithm, we need a reliable way of evaluating the retrieval performance and the comparisons with other algorithms.
For all the five algorithms, the retrieval  performance improves with more feedbacks provided by the user. 
Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.
For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.
One is active learning which selects the most
