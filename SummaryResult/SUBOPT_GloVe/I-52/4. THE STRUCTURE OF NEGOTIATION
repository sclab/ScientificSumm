If the relation on A is acyclic, then each extension Ei of <A, Def>, |Ei| = 1.
The previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations  sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
Let A be a set of arguments, R the  attacking relation of A defined as R ⊆ A × A, and an acyclic relation on A.
Let A be a set of arguments such that A = AO.
