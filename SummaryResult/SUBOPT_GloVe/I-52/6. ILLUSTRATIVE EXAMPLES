The argumentation system AC , DefC of this agent will return a2 as an accepted argument, and a1 as a rejected one.
At this step 4, the offer o2 is acceptable for both agents, thus it is an optimal solution.
Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers.
P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o1, 2 Note that in the above example, since there is no exchange of arguments, the theories of both agents do not change.
Let P and C be two agents , equipped with the
