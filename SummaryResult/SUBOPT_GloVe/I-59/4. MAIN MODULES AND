4.1 Controller Module As noted above, the ability to control the communication of agents is generally not a feature of existing MAS  architectures2 but at the same time a central requirement of our approach for privacy-preserving Information Filtering.
Because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile items is assumed to be uncritical, we extend the  information filtering protocol as follows: The relevant parts of the provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous  interactions between the relay and the provider.
Again , the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use additional relay agents deployed via the user agent
