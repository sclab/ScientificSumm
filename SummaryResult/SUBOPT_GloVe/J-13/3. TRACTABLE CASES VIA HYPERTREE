¡ In the following, rather than working on the hypergraph H associated with a MaxWSP problem, we shall deal with its dual ¯H, i.e., with the hypergraph such that its nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with the hyperedges of H, and where for each node x ∈ N(H), {h | x ∈ h ∧ h ∈ E(H)} is in E( ¯H).
Then , the result follows , since in the top-down phase , the packing hr giving the maximum weight over χ ( Tr ) = E ( H ) is first included in h∗ , and then extended
