In this paper, we solve this problem by proving that the existence of a structured item graph is computationally  intractable, even for treewidth 3.

In fact, the tractability of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed treewidth exists (and if so, computing one) was left as a crucial open problem.
Even more surprisingly , we show that the class of tractable instances identified by means of our approach properly contains the class of instances having a structured
