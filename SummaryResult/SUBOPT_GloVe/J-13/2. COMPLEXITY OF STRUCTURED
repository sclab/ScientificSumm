154 Figure 2: Proof of Theorem 2: (a) from G to HG - hyperedges in 1) and 2) are reported only; (b) a skeleton for a tree decomposition TD for HG.
(a) - other blocks in it (of the form w(x,y)) are defined next.
Connectedness between blocks , and uniqueness of the connections : The second crucial observation is that in the path connecting a vertex of the form bs ( x ) ( resp. , bt ( y ) ) with a vertex of the form ns ( x , e ) ( resp. , nt ( y ,
