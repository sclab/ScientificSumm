Note that, as far as the maximum weighted-set packing problem is concerned, given a hypergraph H, we can always assume that for each node v ∈ N(H), {v} is in E(H).
In fact, if this hyperedge is not in the hypergraph, then it can be added without loss of generality, by setting w({v}) = 0.
Let H be a hypergraph such that for each node v ∈ N(H), {v} is in E(H).
