In order to learn a Bayesian hierarchical model, the  system usually tries to find the most likely model parameters for the given data.
One major challenge of building a recommendation or  personalization system is that the profile learned for a particular user is usually of low quality when the amount of data from that particular user is small.
The effectiveness of these different approaches is mixed, due to how well the underlying model assumption fits the data.
Learning the user profiles is the core problem for these systems.
Section 4 describes how to learn the model parameters using the standard
