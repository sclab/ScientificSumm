The rating, y, for a  document, x, is conditioned on the document and the user model, wm, associated with the user m. Users share information about their models through the prior, Φ = (µ, Σ).
With these settings, we have the following model for the system: 1. µ and Σ are sampled from N(0, aI) and IWν (aI),  respectively.
The joint likelihood for all the variables in the probabilistic model , which includes the data and the parameters , is : P ( D , θ ) = P ( Φ ) m P ( wm|Φ ) j P (
