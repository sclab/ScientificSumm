Thus the corresponding weight of the director in the prior µk at the first M step would be very low , and the variance σm,k will be large (Equations 8 and 7).
Second, the parameters  estimated at the modified M step (Equations 12 - 13) are more accurate than the standard M step described in  Section 4.1 because the exact analytical solutions ¯wm,k = µk and σm,k = σk for the unrelated (m, k) pairs were used in the new algorithm instead of an approximate solution as in the standard algorithm. 
Thus the corresponding kth dimension of the user model ''
