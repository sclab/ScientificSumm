Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that the proposed new  algorithm works better than the standard EM algorithm on the Netflix and MovieLens data sets.
Figure 4 shows that the two algorithms work similarly on the Reuters-E data set.
Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 show that on all data sets, the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach has a  statistical significant improvement over the regularized linear regression model, which is equivalent to the Bayesian  hierarchical models learned at the first iteration.
Although the proposed technique is faster than standard Figure 2: Performance on a Netflix subset with 1,000 users.
