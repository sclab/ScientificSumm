In the following discussion, we use the task of web page  classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.
Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.
In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of  latent factors.
In our model , we connect two components through a
