Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20].
The new representation Z is ensured to capture both the structures of the link matrix A and the content matrix C. Once we find the optimal Z, we can apply the traditional classification or clustering methods on vectorial data Z.
(4) is the joined matrix factorization of A and C with  regularization.
Using the bag-of-words approach , we denote the content of web pages by an n√óm matrix C ,
