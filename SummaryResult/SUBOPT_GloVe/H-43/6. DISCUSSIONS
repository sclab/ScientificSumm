As the example with nonnegative constraints shown in Section 3, we represent each cluster by a latent topic, i.e.
Actually, squared loss does not precisely describe the underlying noise model, because the weights of adjacency matrix can only take nonnegative  values, in our case, zero or one only, and the components of  content matrix C can only take nonnegative integers.
Then the problem of Eq.
When we come to the clustering application, we can use this model to find Z, then apply K-means to partition the web pages into clusters.
Therefore , we allow the components take any possible real
