(The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.) Considering the edges in e ∈ B we can see that any subtree T∗ e we delete from T can not decrease the difference between the payments and the cost of the remaining tree.
First we show how to find a sub-tree T of T∗ , such that for any edge e, the payments of players with sinks in T∗ e is more than the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e}.
