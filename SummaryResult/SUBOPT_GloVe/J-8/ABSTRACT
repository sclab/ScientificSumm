Our main existence results are the following: (1) For a single source and sink we show that there is always a strong equilibrium (both for fair and general connection games).
In this work we study cost sharing connection games, where each player has a source and sink he would like to connect, and the cost of the edges is either shared equally (fair  connection games) or in an arbitrary way (general connection games).
( 2 ) For a single source multiple sinks we show that for a series parallel graph a strong equilibrium always exists ( both for fair and
