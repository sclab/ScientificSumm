Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected cost"s calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having  Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user,  calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.
As a result , the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and
