Since all simulation runs used for generating Figure 6 are based on the same seed, the performance of the self-learning mechanism is constant regardless of the number of types in the environment.
As expected, the average-all mechanism performs best when all agents are of the same type; however its performance deteriorates as the number of types increases.
Figure 6 depicts the performance of the  different methods (for a 40-observation collection period for each agent).
For the Figure 4 environment , average-all is a good strategy for agents of type II , IV and V , because the theoretical reservation value
