Similarly, clustering algorithms  designed for the task of class identification in spatial databases (e.g., relying on a density-based notion [4]) are not useful for our case, because our data has no spatial attributes.
In spite of the richness of available clustering algorithms (such as the famous K-means clustering algorithm [11], hierarchical methods, Bayesian classifiers [6], and maximum entropy), various characteristics of fast-paced domains do not align well with the features of  attributesbased clustering mechanisms, suggesting these mechanisms would not perform well in such domains.
Given space considerations , our review of this area is restricted to some representative approaches for
