Fast-paced environments impose three constraints on any  mechanism for learning a distribution function (including the large range of Bayesian update techniques [23]): (a) the no structure constraint: no a priori information about the structure of the estimated  parameter"s distribution nor any initial data from which such structure can be inferred is available; (b) the limited use constraint: agents typically need to produce only a small number of estimations in total for this parameter; (c) the early use constraint: high  accuracy is a critical requirement even in the initial stages of learning.
The characteristic to be learned is (
