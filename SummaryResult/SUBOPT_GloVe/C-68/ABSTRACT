In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.
Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency  improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.
Our target environment uses data carriers , termed zebroids , where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf
