With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].
This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value ( note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G > > ri ) : δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items , weighted by their frequency of access : δagg ( no −
