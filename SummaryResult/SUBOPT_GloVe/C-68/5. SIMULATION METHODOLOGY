Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.
In all the simulation results, each point is an average of 200,000 requests.
We employ a replication scheme that allocates replicas for a data item as a function of the square-root of the frequency of access of that item.
Hence, we only present them for the metric that captures the percentage improvement in latency with respect to the no-zebroids case. 
We
