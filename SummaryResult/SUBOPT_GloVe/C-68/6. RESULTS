Surprisingly, we find that the improvements in latency obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input  distribution of the popularity of the data items.
When the storage is extremely scarce so that only one replica per data item exists in the AutoMata network, the number of replacements performed by the zebroids is zero since any replacement will cause a data item to be lost from the system.
A similar scenario occurs if N is increased to such a large value that another car with the requested data item is always available in the vicinity of the client.
This is
