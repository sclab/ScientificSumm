FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this study, we examined the improvements in latency that can be obtained in the presence of carriers that deliver a data item from a server to a client.
To better reflect reality we would like to validate the observations obtained from this study with some real world  simulation traces of vehicular movements (for example using  CORSIM [1]).
This will also serve as a validation for the utility of the Markov mobility model used in this study.
We are currently analyzing the performance of zebroids on a real world data set comprising of an ad-hoc network of
