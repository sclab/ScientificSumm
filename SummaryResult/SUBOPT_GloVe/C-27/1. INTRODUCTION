While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.
These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.
Our answer to this challenge is a localization system called Spotlight.
Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.
With such limitations in mind ,
