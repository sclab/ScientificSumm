Our system uses the spatio-temporal properties of well controlled events in the network (e.g., light), to obtain the locations of sensor nodes.
We evaluate the performance of our system in deployments of Mica2 and XSM motes.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a sub-meter localization error, obtained in an outdoor environment, without equipping the wireless sensor nodes with specialized ranging hardware.
Through performance evaluations of a real system deployed outdoors, we obtain a 20cm localization error.
We demonstrate that a high accuracy in localization can be achieved without the aid of expensive hardware on
