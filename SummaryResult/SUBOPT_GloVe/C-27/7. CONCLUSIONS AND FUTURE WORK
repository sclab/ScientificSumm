The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.
All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.
This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].
Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.
the costs can be amortized through several deployments
