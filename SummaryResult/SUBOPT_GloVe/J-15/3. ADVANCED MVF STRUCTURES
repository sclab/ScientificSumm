, g (4) fr = u([Ir]) + r−1X k=1 (−1)k X 1≤i1<···<ik<r u([ k\ s=1 Iis ∩ Ir]) The proof directly shows that if graph G = (A, E) is a perfect map of CDI, u(A) decomposes to a sum over the functions defined in (4).1 Thus this proof does not rely on the decomposition result of Theorem 5, only on the existence of the perfect map.
(2) An immediate result of Proposition 4 is that CDI is a symmetric relation.
Then the functional decomposition from that theorem can be defined as f1 = u ( [
