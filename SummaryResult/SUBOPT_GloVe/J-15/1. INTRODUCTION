To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.
We first lay out a representation framework for preferences that captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute  configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each.
We employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive independence (GAI), a model flexible enough to accommodate  interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired, yet  providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence can be limited.
To apply it for modeling values
