An outcome in this space is represented for example by (θ , p ), where θ is an instantiation of A and p is a value of p. We further assume that preferences are quasi-linear in p, that is there exists a value function of the form v(A, p) = u(A) + L(p), where L is a positive linear function.2 The quasi-linear form immediately qualifies money as a  measure of preference differences, and establishes a monetary scale for u(A).
Eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the utility ( wtp ) of one full outcome ( the reference outcome
