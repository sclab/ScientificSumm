We also aim to extend our  formulation to other collaborative filtering algorithms, study the effect of shilling in altering rating roles, conduct field studies, and evaluate improvements in user experience by tweaking ratings based on their role values.
Finally, we plan to develop the idea of mining the evolution of rating role patterns into a reporting and tracking system for all aspects of recommender system health. 
In future research, we plan to systematically study the many algorithmic parameters, tolerances, and cutoff  thresholds employed here and reason about their effects on the downstream conclusions.
To further recommender system acceptance and deployment
