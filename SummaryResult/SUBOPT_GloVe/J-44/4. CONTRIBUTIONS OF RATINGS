A prediction of item i for a user u is computed as the weighted deviation from the item"s mean rating as shown in Equation (4).
We assume that we have a test set of the users" ratings of the items presented in the recommendation list.
We again add the role values obtained from all the experiments to form a triple [SF, CF, PF] for each rating.
By tracking the role of each rating in a prediction , we can accumulate the credit for a rating in each of the three roles , and also track the evolution
