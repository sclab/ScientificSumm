Based on such a model a scheduling agent is built that uses the performance model to select the best resource set and the best application schedule on this set.
In the context of this project, a number of applications were studied and performance models for these applications were created.
Another disadvantage of these systems is that the performance degradation detection is suitable only for iterative or regular applications.
In the resource selection phase, a number of possible resource sets is examined and the set of  resources with the shortest predicted runtime is selected.
AppLeS scheduling agents are written on a
