Existing solutions to these two problems require that a  performance model for an application is known.
We evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the Grid.
One important problem in grid computing is resource selection, that is, finding an appropriate resource set for the application.
Then, we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs.
Another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid  environment.
During the application run, we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and  deduce application requirements from these statistics.
We start an application on any set of
