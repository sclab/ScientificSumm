Adaptation reduces the iteration time by a factor of 3 (Scenario 1a), 1.7 (Scenario 1b) and 1.2 (Scenario 1c) which allows us to conclude that the gains in the total runtime would be even bigger if the application were run longer than for 15 iterations.
On this number of nodes, the application runs with 50% efficiency, so we consider it a reasonable number of nodes.
Since Barnes-Hut is an iterative application, we also measured the time of each iteration, as shown in Figure 3.
As mentioned above , in this scenario we measured three runtimes : the runtime of the
