Existing approaches to these  problems typically assume the existence of a performance model that allows predicting application runtimes on various sets of resources.
This problem can be solved by implementing a hierarchy of coordinators: one  subcoordinator per cluster which collects and processes statistics from its cluster and one main coordinator which collects the information from the sub-coordinators.
For  example, the node badness formula could be refined at runtime based on the effectiveness of the previous adaptation decisions.
Our simple adaptation strategy allows us to handle multiple scenarios typical for grid environments : expand to more nodes or shrink to fewer
