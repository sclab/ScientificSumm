It also has an  assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of  mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually  allocated to the task), and performance.
It seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the  dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations.
Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in  order to enhance human performance.
Most cognitive scientists [
