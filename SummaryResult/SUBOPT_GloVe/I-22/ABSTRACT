The establishment of shared belief maps relies on inter-agent information  sharing, the effectiveness of which highly depends on agents"  processing loads and the instantaneous cognitive loads of their human partners.
The shared belief map concept and the cognitive/processing load models have been implemented in a cognitive agent  architectureSMMall.
A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the concept, the models, and their impacts on the evolving of shared mental models of HAP teams.
In this paper the concept Shared Belief Map is proposed as a basis for developing realistic shared expectations among a team of Human-Agent-Pairs (HAPs).
