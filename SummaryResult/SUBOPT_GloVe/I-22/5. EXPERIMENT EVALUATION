4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.
When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2)  consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into  multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.
To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM , we designed 3 Agent
