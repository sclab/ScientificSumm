Motivated by the simulation results, future research in this field will focus on modeling different behaviors of the self-interested agents, which might cause more damage to the network.
Using  simulations we investigated two behaviors that might be taken by self-interested agents: (a) trying to minimize their  journey length, and (b) trying to cause chaos in the network.
Our simulations indicate that in both behaviors the  selfinterested agents have only limited success achieving their goal, even if no counter-measures are taken.
This is in  contrast to the greater impact inflicted by self-interested agents in other domains (e.g., E-Commerce).
