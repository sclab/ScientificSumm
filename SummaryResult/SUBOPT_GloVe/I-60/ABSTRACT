As more and more cars are equipped with GPS and Wi-Fi transmitters, it becomes easier to design systems that will allow cars to interact autonomously with each other, e.g., regarding traffic on the roads.
Nonetheless, this new technology and agent  applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car owners, who will care more about their own welfare than the social welfare of their peers.
Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a  natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.
