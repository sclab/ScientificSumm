For example, whereas the average journey length of the regular agents increased only by about 15% in the original scenario, in which the  network was not congested, in this scenario the average journey length of the agents had increased by about 60%. 
For example: the run with 50  selfinterested agents consisted of all the self-interested agents that were used in the run with 32 self-interested agents, but with an additional 18 self-interested agents.
The average normalized value for the gossip agents in these simulations was only about 1.07, as opposed to 1.7 in the original scenario.
The results also indicate
