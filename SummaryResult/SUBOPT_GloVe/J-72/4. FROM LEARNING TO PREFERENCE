Because of our Lindahl price construction, when all agents reply ‘YES" to a demand query, we have found an optimal  allocation, analogous to the case where an agent replies ‘YES" to an equivalence query when the target function has been exactly learned.
That is, the resulting algorithm does not simply learn the  valuations exactly, then compute an optimal allocation.
ELICITATION The key to converting a learning algorithm to an  elicitation algorithm is to simulate equivalence queries with  demand and value queries until an optimal allocation is found.
We would not obtain this property with equivalence queries based on
