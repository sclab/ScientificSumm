Finally, it would be useful to determine whether the ORâˆ— bidding language [11] can be efficiently learned (and hence elicited), given this language"s expressiveness and  succinctness for a wide variety of valuation classes.
Equivalence queries can only be, and need only be, simulated up to the point where an optimal allocation has been computed.
Our result allows us to apply the wealth of available learning algorithms to the problem of preference elicitation.
[5] provide such an example when considering membership/value queries only (Theorem 4).
At the heart of this result is the fact that demand queries may be
