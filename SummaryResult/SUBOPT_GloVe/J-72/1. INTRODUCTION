Since their work is also grounded in learning theory, they allow dependence on the size of the target  valuation as we do (though read-once valuations can always be succinctly represented anyway).
In contrast, our work shows that given a more general (yet still quite standard) version of demand query than the type they consider, the complexity of preference elicitation is no greater than the complexity of learning.
These considerations motivate the need for auction protocols that minimize the communication and information revelation required to determine an optimal  allocation of goods.
There has been recent work exploring the links between the
