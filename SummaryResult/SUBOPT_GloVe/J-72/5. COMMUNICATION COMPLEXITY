If the learning algorithm"s equivalence  queries are all proper, it may then also be possible to provide tight bounds on the communication requirements of the  resulting elicitation algorithm.
Representing the surplus πi to agent i cannot require space greater than q(size(˜vi), m) for some fixed polynomial q, because we assume that the chosen representation is polynomially interpretable, and thus any value generated will be of polynomial size.
Thus the value and demand queries, and the  responses to these queries, are always of polynomial size.
Nisan and Segal [ 12 ] show that for a variety
