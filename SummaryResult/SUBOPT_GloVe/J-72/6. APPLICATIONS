The  majority valuation is a special case of the r-of-S valuation with r = m/2 and S = M. These valuations are appropriate for representing substitutabilities: once a required set of items has been obtained, no other items can add value.
To provide this guarantee, r must be known to the algorithm, but S (and k) are unknown.
