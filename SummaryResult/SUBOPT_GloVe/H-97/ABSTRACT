Whereas Information Retrieval and Machine Learning techniques are gaining initial acceptance in spam filtering and automated folder assignment, this paper reports on a new task: automated action-item detection, in order to flag emails that require responses, and to highlight the specific passage(s) indicating the  request(s) for action.
