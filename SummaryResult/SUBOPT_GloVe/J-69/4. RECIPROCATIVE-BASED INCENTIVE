An example of  objective reputation is to use the Reciprocative decision function with shared history to count the total number of cooperations a player has given to and received from all entities in the system; another example is the Image strategy [28].
Since we bound the running time of the maxflow algorithm, cooperation decreases as the population size increases, but the key point is that the subjective Reciprocative decision function scales to higher populations than one using private history.
In scenarios with selective users we omit the complete availability assumption to prevent players from being clustered into a lot of
