We show that the maxflow-based  algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20].
We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative  decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover.
While social dilemmas have been studied extensively , P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges , including : â€¢ Large populations and high turnover : A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa
