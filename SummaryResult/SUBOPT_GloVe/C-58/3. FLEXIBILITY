In the other extreme case of the aggressive Update-All immediate computation and propagation on writes [38], when an update occurs, changes are aggregated up the tree, and each new aggregate value is flooded to all of a node"s descendants.
In our implementation we choose to return results at all levels k < l for a level-l probe because ( i ) it is inexpensive as the nodes traversed for level-l probe also contain level k aggregates for k < l and as we expect the network cost of transmitting the additional information to be small for the small
