The system associates an aggregation function ftype with each attribute type, and for each level-i subtree Ti in the  system, the system defines an aggregate value Vi,type,name for each  (at380 tributeType, attributeName) pair as follows.
Our aggregation abstraction is defined across a tree spanning all nodes in the system.
Then the aggregate value for a level-i subtree Ti is the aggregation  function for the type, ftype computed across the aggregate values of each of Ti"s k children: Vi,type,name = ftype(V0 i−1,type,name,V1 i−1,type,name,...,Vk−1 i−1,type,name).
