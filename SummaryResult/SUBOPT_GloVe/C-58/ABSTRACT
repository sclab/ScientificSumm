We present a Scalable Distributed Information Management  System (SDIMS) that aggregates information about large-scale  networked systems and that can serve as a basic building block for a broad range of large-scale distributed applications by providing  detailed views of nearby information and summary views of global  information.
We design , implement and evaluate a SDIMS that ( 1 ) leverages Distributed Hash Tables ( DHT ) to create scalable aggregation trees , ( 2 ) provides flexibility through a simple API that lets applications control propagation of reads and writes , ( 3 ) provides administrative isolation through simple extensions to
