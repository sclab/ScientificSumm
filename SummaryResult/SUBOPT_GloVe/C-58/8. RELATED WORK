Many systems-building upon both Plaxton"s bit-correcting strategy [32, 46] and upon other strategies [24, 29, 35]-have chosen to hide this power and export a simple and  general distributed hash table abstraction as a useful building block for a broad range of distributed applications.
With the aggregation abstraction provided by our system, designing and building of such applications becomes easier.
"s [28] original paper  describes not a DHT, but a system for hierarchically aggregating and querying object location data in order to route requests to nearby copies of objects.
Some of these systems internally make use of
