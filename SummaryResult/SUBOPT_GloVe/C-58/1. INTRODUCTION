It is interesting to note that although these systems export a global hash table abstraction, many of them internally make use of what can be viewed as a scalable system of aggregation trees to, for example, route a request for a given key to the right DHT node.
Additional work is needed to understand the  significance of this limitation for real workloads and, if necessary, to adapt query planning techniques from DHT abstractions [16, 19] to scalable aggregation tree abstractions.
However , meeting the SDIMS requirements forces a design to address four questions : ( 1 ) How to scalably
