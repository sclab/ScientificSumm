Subjects attempted one task of each complexity, 2 The main experiment from which these results are drawn had a third comparator system which had a different interface.
The tasks were phrased in the form of simulated work task situations [2], i.e., short search scenarios that were designed to reflect real-life search situations and allow subjects to develop personal assessments of relevance.
Task complexity was varied according to the methodology described in [1], specifically by varying the number of potential information sources and types of information required, to complete a task.
The order in which systems were used and search tasks
