Two of the fundamental problems in addressing the flow problem are: (i) modeling and simulating such a large complex system as the fidelity required to provide reliable  results is difficult to achieve; and (ii) establishing the method by which the flow management is evaluated, as directly  minimizing the total delay may lead to inequities towards  particular regions or commercial entities.
Similarly, because of the business and political impact of dynamic airspace configuration, we will not address the outermost flow control level either.
The relative importance of these two penalties is determined by the value of Î± , and we explore
