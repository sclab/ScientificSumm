In this work, we explore four different agent reward functions, and compare them to simulating various changes to the system and selecting the best solution (e.g,  equivalent to a Monte-Carlo search).
In Section 4 we present results in domains with one and two congestions, explore different trade-offs of the system objective function, discuss the scaling properties of the different agent rewards and  discuss the computational cost of achieving certain levels of performance.
In a reinforcement learning approach, the selection of the agent reward has a large impact on the performance of the system.
Unlike many other flow problems where the
