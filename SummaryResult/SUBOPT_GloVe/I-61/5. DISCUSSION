Finally, in cooperation with domain experts, we are investigating different system evaluation functions, above and beyond the delay and congestion dependent G presented in this paper.
First, we are exploring new methods of estimating agent  rewards, to further speed up the simulations.
The main contribution of this paper is to present a distributed adaptive air traffic flow management algorithm that can be readily implemented and to test that algorithm using FACET, a simulation tool widely used by the FAA, NASA and the industry.
It offers the significant benefit of not requiring radical changes to the current air flow management structure
