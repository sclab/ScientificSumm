Additionally, these models can be interpreted as assuming the scores produced by the text classifier have three basic types of empirical behavior - one corresponding to each of the extremely irrelevant, hard to discriminate, and obviously relevant items.
Parametric models generally use assumptions that the data  conform to the model to trade-off flexibility with the ability to estimate the model parameters accurately with little training data.
Finally, they are also amenable to making other types of cost-sensitive  decisions [26] and for combining decisions [3].
While some of these methods allow the distributions of the documents relevant and irrelevant to the topic
