We have given an efficient way to estimate the parameters of these distributions.
Thanks also to Jaime Carbonell and John Lafferty for their useful feedback on the final versions of this paper. 
While these distributions attempt to strike a balance between the generalization power of parametric distributions and the flexibility that the added asymmetric parameters give, the asymmetric  Gaussian appears to have too great of an emphasis away from the modes.
In striking contrast , the asymmetric Laplace distribution appears to be preferable over several large text domains and a variety of performance measures to the primary competing parametric methods
