First, we introduce a client-server architecture where the work is distributed between the server and the  individual clients for spatial query evaluation, data visualization, and data management.
This is a centralized peer-to-peer approach that helps Internet users transfer large volumes of online data efficiently.
We enable the minimization of the requirements for system resources on the client side while maximizing system responsiveness as well as the number of connections one server can handle concurrently.
Second, for prolonged periods of access to large online data, we  introduce APPOINT (an Approach for Peer-to-Peer Oï¬„oading the INTernet).
We propose two efficient approaches to
