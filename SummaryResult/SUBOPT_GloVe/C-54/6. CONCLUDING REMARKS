This will also  convert the SAND system from a research-oriented prototype into a product that could be used by end users for  accessing, viewing, and analyzing their data efficiently and with minimum effort. 
In order to access multiple data sources in real time, it is desirable to look for a mechanism that would support data exchange by design.
An overview of our efforts in providing remote access to large spatial data has been given.
This will turn the SAND system into a universal tool for accessing any spatial data set as it will be deployable on most platforms , work
