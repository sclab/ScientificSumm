Since the locally run database is only updated when  additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.
In these cases, the database is maintained in one  location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).
Notice , that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel , then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made
