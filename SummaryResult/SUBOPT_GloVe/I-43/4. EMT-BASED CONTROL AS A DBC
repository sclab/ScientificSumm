The prediction is based on the environment model provided by the Environment Design level , so that if we denote by Ta the environment '' s transition function limited to action a , and pt−1 is the auxiliary Bayesian system state estimator , then the EMT-based control choice is described by a∗ = arg min a∈A DKL ( H [ Ta × pt , pt , τt EMT ] qEMT × pt−1 ) Note that this follows the Markovian DBC framework precisely : the rewarding optimality of POMDPs is discarded , and in its place a dynamics estimator ( EMT
