Three configurations of the domain shown in Figure 3 were used, each posing a different challenge to the agent due to  partial observability.
In the classical version of the game, co-location leads to a special observation, and the â€˜Tag" action can be performed.
In every run, the initial position of both the agent and its quarry was selected at random; this means that as far as the agent was concerned, the quarry"s initial position was uniformly distributed over the entire domain cell space.
