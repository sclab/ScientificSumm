The importance of the second source was underlined by the Tag Game experiment data, in which the greedy EMT algorithm, applied to a POMDP-type state space specification, failed, since target description over such a state space was incapable of encoding the necessary behavior  tendencies, e.g., tie-breaking and commitment to directed motion.
DBC, on the other hand, has two sources of sequencing specification: through the properties of an action selection procedure, and through direct specification within the target dynamics.
However, the ratio between EMT performance and achievability of target dynamics remains to be explored.
The design of the EMT solution for
