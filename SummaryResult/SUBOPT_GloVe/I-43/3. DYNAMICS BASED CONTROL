â€¢ Agent Level in turn combines the environment model from the Environment Design level, the dynamics estimation  procedure, the deviation measure and the target dynamics  specification from User Level, to produce a sequence of actions that create system dynamics as close as possible to the  targeted specification.
For  example, this level would specify the laws of physics within the system, and set its parameters, such as the gravitation  constant.
This can be viewed as if the sequencing of states and the attributes of that sequencing are only introduced by and for the controlling mechanism-the POMDP policy.
For instance , KullbackLeibler
