In this paper, we are interested in the restriction of the causality relation to the subset of events defined as being the relevant events of the computation.
Moreover, in this protocol, timestamps attached to messages are of size n. This raises the following question which, to our  knowledge, has never been answered: Are there efficient vector clock implementation techniques that are suitable for the IPT problem?.
More precisely , given two events e and f of a distributed computation , a crucial problem that has to be solved in a lot of distributed applications is to know whether they are
