These observations lead to the definition of the condition K(m, k) that characterizes which entries of vectors V Ci and IPi can be omitted from the control information attached to a message m sent by a process Pi to a process Pj: Definition 5.
In such a case, the value m.V C[k] is useless, and could be omitted from the control information transmitted with m by Pi to Pj.
Similarly, some entries IPj[k] are not updated when a message m from Pi is received by Pj.
Rule R3 shows that a process Pj does not systematically update
