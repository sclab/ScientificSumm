An important causality-related distributed computing  problem, that we call the Immediate Predecessors Tracking (IPT) problem, consists in associating with each relevant event, on the fly and without using additional control messages, the set of relevant events that are its immediate predecessors in the partial order.
A distributed computation is usually modeled as a partially ordered set of relevant events (the relevant events are a  subset of the primitive events produced by the computation).
The family is defined by a general condition that allows application messages to piggyback control information whose size can be smaller than n ( the number of
