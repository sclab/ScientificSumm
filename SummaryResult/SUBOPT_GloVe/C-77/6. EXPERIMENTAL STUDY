From these figures, we observe that, whatever the time distribution  followed by the relevant events, both IPT2 and IPT3 exhibit a behavior better than IPT1 (i.e., the total number of  piggybacked triples is lower in IPT2 and IPT3 than in IPT1), even in the worst case (see Figure 3.d).
As the relevant events are taken only during the very beginning of the simulation, this figure exhibits a very steep slope as the other figures.
The parameter λ of the Poisson time distribution ( λ is the average number of relevant events in a given time interval ) has been set
