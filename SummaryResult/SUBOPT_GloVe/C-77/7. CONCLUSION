Interestingly, it has also been shown that the efficiency of the protocols (measured in terms of the size of the control information that is not piggybacked by an application  message) depends on the pattern defined by the communication events and the relevant events.
The resulting protocols, that implement a vector clock system, are particularly efficient as far as the size of the timestamp carried by each message is concerned.
Last but not least , it is interesting to note that if one is not interested in tracking the immediate predecessor events , the protocols presented in the paper can be
