Second, for lastr(e, j) to be immediate predecessor of e, there must not be another lastr(e, k) event on a path between lastr(e, j) and e. These observations are formalized in the following definition: Definition 4.
It results from Lemmas 2 and 3 that, if e is a receive event (e = receive(m)), then determining e.IPi  involves information related to the event send(m).
The intuitive meaning of the next lemma is the following : if e is a receive event receive ( m ) , and pred ( e ) is not relevant , the last
