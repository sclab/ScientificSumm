ON EVALUABLE CONDITIONS It results from the previous theorem that, if Pi could evaluate K(m, k) when it sends m to Pj, this would  allow us improve the previous IPT protocol in the following way: in rule R2, the triple (k, V Ci[k], IPi[k]) is  transmitted with m only if Â¬K(m, k).
Differently , the matrix Mi does not belong to the problem specification , it is an auxiliary variable of the IPT protocol , which manages it so as to satisfy the following implication when Pi sends m to Pj : ( Mi [ j
