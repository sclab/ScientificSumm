If e is the first event produced by Pi, then pred(e) is denoted by ⊥ (meaning that there is no such event), and ∀e ∈ Hi : ⊥ < e. The partial order bH = (H, hb →)  constitutes a formal model of the distributed computation it is associated with.
Throughout the paper, we will use the following notation: if e ∈ Hi is not the first event produced by Pi, then pred(e) denotes the event immediately preceding e in the sequence Hi.
Note that V Ci[i] counts the number of relevant events produced so far by Pi.
