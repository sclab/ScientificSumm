(1) Let x be a strategy profile which is obtained from x by a (one-step) addition of some resource a ∈ M by some agent i ∈ N(x) (note that x is nearly-even).
We note that for profile x ∈ Σ3 ⊆ Σ1 , with all resources being x-light, conditions (2) and (1) are equivalent.
If there exists a ∈ xi ∩ M ( x ) then i satisfies ( 1 ) , implying by the choice of agent i , that the above obviously yields the correctness of ( 1 ) for any agent k ∈ N. Otherwise ,
