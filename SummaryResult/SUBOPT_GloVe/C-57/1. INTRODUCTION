Furthermore, the procedures proposed by the authors in [10] for the construction of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium are not valid in our model, even in the simple, agent-symmetric case, where all agents have the same benefit from successful completion of their tasks.
PScongestion games were generalized to weighted congestion games [6] (or, ID-congestion games [7]), in which the  resource cost functions are not only player-specific, but also depend on the identity of the users of the resource.
In particular , if in our model the resource failure probabilities were constant and known in advance , then a potential function
