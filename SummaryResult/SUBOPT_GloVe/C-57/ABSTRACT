In addition, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such framework, where the failure probability of each resource depends on the number of agents selecting this resource.
It is the first model to  incorporate failures into congestion settings, which results in a strict generalization of congestion games.
We define a new class of games, congestion games with  loaddependent failures (CGLFs), which generalizes the well-known class of congestion games, by incorporating the issue of  resource failures into congestion games.
In a CGLF , agents share a common set of resources , where each resource has a cost and
