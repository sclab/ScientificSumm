This framework has to be extended to smoothly interact with the resource management and the EDAS architecture.
In a next step the resource management will be integrate in an already implemented prototype of the EDAS  architecture.
In a final step we need to implement some services that verify the usability of the whole EDAS project. 
As described we have already an early implementation of the framework for the decentralized adaptive services.
Based on the fragmented object model and the  architecture of the EDAS environment, decentralized adaptive  services can be easily designed, implemented and executed.
As described the resource management can
