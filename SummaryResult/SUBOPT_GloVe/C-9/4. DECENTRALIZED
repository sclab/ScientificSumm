If the service  environment has not reached its global limit and the node is not overloaded the dependent local limit of the service should be extended simply by reducing a local limit at another node of the same service environment.
In fact it can be needless as the services might not use all the assigned resources but the diffusive algorithm caused the limit overrun by equally balancing the free  resources of all supported service environments.
Therefore the assigned resources of a service environment at a node can be easily computed by summing up all local limits of its services.
The
