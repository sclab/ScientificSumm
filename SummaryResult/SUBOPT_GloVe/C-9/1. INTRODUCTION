The overall goal is to provide a generic service architecture that allows to implement the service functionality once, and then, ideally, run this  service with different service models and adapt it at run-time, thereby scaling from a single user local instance to a  multidomain-spanning scalable service.
The whole process Article 5 of rededication is scalable as it is decentralized and respects certain limits like the physically available resources of a node and the amount of resources dedicated to a project.
To reduce the implementation effort of such services a framework has been developed that supports the run-time evolution from a
