To test our algorithm, we separate the whole data set into two parts according to the time: the first 2/3 data is used to simulate the historical data that a search engine  accumulated, and we use the last 1/3 to simulate future queries.
Since we want to test whether our algorithm can learn from the past queries, we also filter out those test cases whose queries can not retrieve at least 100 pseudo-documents from our history collection.
On average, we have 6.23 and 5.89 clicks for each test case in the two test sets respectively. 
Different test cases may have
