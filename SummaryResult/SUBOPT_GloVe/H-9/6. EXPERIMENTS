In this  table, we can see that in both test collections, our method is better than both the baseline and the cluster-based methods.
In order to test the hypothesis that log-based method help more those queries with diverse results, we compute the size ratios of the biggest and second biggest clusters in our log-based  results and use this ratio as an indicator of diversity.
In our experiments, we observe that the sizes of the best clusters are all larger than 5, and this ensures that P@5 is a meaningful metric.
We use Precision at 5 documents ( P @
