There are several interesting directions for further  extending our work: First, although our experiment results have clearly shown promise of the idea of learning from search logs to organize search results, the methods we have  experimented with are relatively simple.
It would thus be interesting to study how to further improve the  organization of the results based on such feedback information.
Second, with the proposed way of organizing search results, we can  expect to obtain informative feedback information from a user (e.g., the aspect chosen by a user to view).
In particular , we hope to develop probabilistic models for
