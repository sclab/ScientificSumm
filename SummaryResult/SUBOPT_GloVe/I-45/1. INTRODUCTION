Recognising these limitations of the traditional approach to  designing agent interactions, a number of approaches have been  proposed in recent years that move away from message-centric  interaction protocols, and instead consider designing agent interactions using higher-level concepts such as social commitments [8, 10, 18] or interaction goals [2].
This paper presents what, to the best of our knowledge, is the second AOPL to support high-level, flexible, and robust agent  interaction implementation.
It has been argued that this message-centric approach to  interaction design is not a good match for intelligent agents.
On the other hand , when following an interaction protocol
