The essence of the proof is to argue that as long as agents haven"t yet converged to the same state, all actions must be monotonic, and hence that these actions commute, and cannot disable any other actions.
For example, if A1 has the effect +p, and A2 has precondition Â¬p, then although both actions may be enabled in the initial state, they cannot be performed in either order.
The result , in an alternating turn setup , is a dead-end : there is only a single possible action in state 12 , namely sendEPO , but
