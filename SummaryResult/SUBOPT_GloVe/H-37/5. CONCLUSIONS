Finally, we note that the success of relaxed SVM methods for content-based spam detection is a result that depends on the nature of spam data, which is potentially subject to change.
It appears that spam data is highly separable, allowing ROSVM to be successful with high  values of C and little effort given to maximizing the margin.
These  methods are efficient enough for large-scale filtering of  contentbased spam in its many forms.
These indicative features may be sparsely represented in the data set , because of spam methods such as word obfuscation , in which common spam words are intentionally
