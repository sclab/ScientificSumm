Thus, the margin found by an  optimization is not guaranteed to be one that maximizes the margin for the global data set of examples {x1, .
Note that this is not equivalent to training a new SVM classifier from scratch on the p most recent examples,  because each successive optimization problem is seeded with the previous hypothesis w [8].
However , as we saw in the previous section , the task of content-based spam detection is best achieved by SVMs with a high value of C. Setting C to a high value for this domain implies that minimizing training loss is
