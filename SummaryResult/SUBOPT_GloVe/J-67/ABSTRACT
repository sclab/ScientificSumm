For the resulting mechanism design problem (in which we also slightly strengthen an assumption from the non-strategic setting), we present a mechanism that  addresses each incentive issue, while only increasing the  competitive ratio by one.
Motivated by emerging areas such as grid computing, we instead consider this  problem in an economic setting, in which each job is released to a separate, self-interested agent.
For the problem of online real-time scheduling of jobs on a single processor, previous work presents matching upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio that can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm.
However , these results
