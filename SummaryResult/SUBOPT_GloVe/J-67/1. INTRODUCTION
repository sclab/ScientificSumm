Two papers paint a complete picture in terms of  competitive analysis for this setting, in which the algorithm is assumed to know k, the maximum ratio between the value densities (value divided by processing time) of any two jobs.
We also show how we can simplify this mechanism for the special case in which k = 1 and each agent cannot alter the length of its job.
One interpretation of this approach is as a game  between the designer of the online algorithm and an adversary.
Each agent now has four different ways in which it can manipulate the algorithm
