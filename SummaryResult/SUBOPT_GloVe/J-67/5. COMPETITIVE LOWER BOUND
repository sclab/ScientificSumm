Then, in order to achieve the desired competitive ratio, it must execute job x continuously until its deadline, which is by construction at least as late as the new deadline df of job f. Thus, job f will not be completed, and, by IR and NNP, it must be the case that pf (θf , θ−f , θx) = 0 and uf (g(θf , θ−f , θx), θf ) = 0.
We note , however , that both Γ1 and Γ2 satisfy it trivially , and that , in the following proof , zero only serves as a baseline utility for an agent , and could
