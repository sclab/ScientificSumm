We also know that tclose f − ts c ≤ lc ≤ vc must hold, by the simplifying normalization of ρmin = 1 and the fact that job c"s execution time cannot exceed its length.
First note that job i can not have a higher priority , since there would have to exist a t ∈ ( tp , tc ) such that ∃y ∈ 6 For simplicity , when we give the formal condition for a job x to have a higher priority than another job y , we will assume that job x '' s priority
