Finally, we extend the analysis to online  negotiation where different issues become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
The agents have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors.
Here different agents value different issues differently.
Then, we analyse their time  complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem, even in a complete information setting.
The time complexity of the approximate equilibrium strategies is O(nm/ 2 ) where n is the negotiation deadline and the relative error.
For such negotiations , we first
