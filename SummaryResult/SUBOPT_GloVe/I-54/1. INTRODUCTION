Given this, we consider indivisible issues and first analyze the strategic behaviour of agents to obtain the equilibrium strategies for the case where all the issues for negotiation are known a priori to both agents.
Finally, we extend the analysis to online negotiation where different issues become  available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
Then, in order to overcome the problem of time  complexity, we present strategies that are approximately optimal but  computationally efficient, and show that they form an equilibrium.
An issue , in its entirety , must be allocated
