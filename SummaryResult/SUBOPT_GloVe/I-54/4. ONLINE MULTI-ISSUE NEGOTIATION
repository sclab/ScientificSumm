This algorithm takes the values of ka i and kb i one at a time and generates an approximate solution to the above knapsack problem.
Since the first mover is the same for all the issues, and the agents make offers alternately, the offering agent for t = n is also the same for all the m issues.
Note that the subscript m is used to indicate the fact that this difference depends on m. We now describe the protocol for online negotiation and then obtain an approximate equilibrium.
Assume that b is the offering agent for t = n. As
