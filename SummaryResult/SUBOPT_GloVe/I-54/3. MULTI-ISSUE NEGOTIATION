On the other hand, if b is the offering agent at t = n âˆ’ 1, it uses APPROX-TRADEOFFB to obtain the approximate equilibrium  package.
Thus, the relative error for these two functions is the same as that for Ibarra and Kim"s method (i.e., it is at most where is given in Equation 5).
However, since an offer for the package deal includes a share for all the m issues, the agents can now make tradeoffs across the issues in order to  maximise their cumulative utilities.
On the other hand , the equilibrium strategy for the agent that receives
