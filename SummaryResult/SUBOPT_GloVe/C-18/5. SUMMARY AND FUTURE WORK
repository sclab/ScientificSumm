Some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be consider are as follows: • Is it possible to apply some of learning concepts  developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way that true emergent behavior takes place?
In addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called ZachiK.
• Are the current techniques being developed in the design of Intrusion Detection & CounterMeasure Systems and Survivable systems effective against this new class of
