We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3.
For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of  susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings 328 at creation time) is more effective than sharing  passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm.
In this set of experiments , the sharing of passwords provides an order of magnitude improvement over a memoryless random
