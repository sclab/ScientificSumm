Other researchers have proposed the use of detectors where rates of  Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the  organization to the potential presence of a worm.
That is, systems are being designed and developed to  effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.
Vern Paxson of the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer commented : The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human response was ineffective , see [ 4 ] The interesting part , from our perspective , about the
