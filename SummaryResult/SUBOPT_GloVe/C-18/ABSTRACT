However, such strategies are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.
Most proposed  countermeasures strategies are based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms.
In addition, we will present preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such swarm worm, called the ZachiK worm.
In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of Swarm Worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a swarm worm.
Specifically , we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms , whose behavior
