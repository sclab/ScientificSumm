If S is a tuple of strategies, one for each agent, and x ∈ {C, D}, then we denote by AGx S the subset of agents that play strategy x in S. Hence, for a social system Σ = M , η , the normative system η AGC S only implements the restrictions for those agents that choose to cooperate in GΣ.
For the ⇒ direction , if there is an individually rational normative system η , then we construct a satisfying assignment for ϕ by considering the arcs that are forbidden by η : formula ( 1 ) ensures that we must
