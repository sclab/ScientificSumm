Formally, let K = S, S0 ,R, A,α, V be a Kripke structure, let C ⊆ A be a set of agents over K, and let η be a normative system over K. Then: • η C denotes the normative system that is the same as η except that it only contains the arcs of η that correspond to the actions of agents in C. We call η C the restriction of η to C, and it is defined as: η C = {(s, s ) : (s, s ) ∈ η & α(s, s ) ∈ C}.
• η C denotes the normative system
