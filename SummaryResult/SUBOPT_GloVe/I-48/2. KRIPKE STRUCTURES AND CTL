The semantics of CTL are given with respect to the satisfaction relation |=, which holds between pairs of the form K, s, (where K is a Kripke structure and s is a state in K), and formulae of the language.
A Kripke structure is essentially a directed graph , with the vertex set S corresponding to possible states of the system being modelled , and the relation R ⊆ S × S capturing the 881 978-81-904262-7-5 ( RPS ) c 2007 IFAAMAS possible transitions of the system ; intuitively , these transitions are caused by agents in the system performing
