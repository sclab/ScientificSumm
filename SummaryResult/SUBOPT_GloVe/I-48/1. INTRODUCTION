Using this scheme, we define a model of ordinal utility, which in turn allows us to interpret our  Kripkebased normative systems as games, in which agents must determine whether to comply with the normative system or not.
Although the various approaches to normative systems proposed in the literature differ on technical details, they all share the same  basic intuition that a normative system is a set of constraints on the behaviour of agents in the system; by imposing these constraints, it is hoped that some desirable objective will emerge.
In this paper , we develop a model of normative systems
