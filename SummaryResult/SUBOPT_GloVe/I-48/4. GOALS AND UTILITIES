We make this precise in the function ui (·): ui (K) = max{j : 0 ≤ j ≤ |γi | & K |= γi [j ]} Note that using these definitions of goals and utility, it never makes sense to have a goal ϕ at index n if there is a logically weaker goal ψ at index n + k in the hierarchy: by definition of utility, it could never be n for any structure K. EXAMPLE 1.
To see that ϕ2 4 = A E♦p2 is true in s for instance : note that on ever path it is always the case that there
