Indeed, the figures show only the delay time for delivered messages.
4.4 Metrics We define a set of metrics that we use in evaluating routing  protocols in opportunistic networks: â€¢ delivery ratio, the ratio of the number of messages delivered to the number of total messages generated.
For direct delivery, random, and the probability-based routing protocols, relatively few messages were delivered for short TTLs, so many messages expired before they could reach their destination; those messages had infinite delivery delay and were not included in the median or mean measurements.
The number of message transmissions of epidemic routing was more
