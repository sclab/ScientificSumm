We did not implement and evaluate these routing protocols, because either they require domain-specific  information (location information) [14, 15], assume certain mobility patterns [17], present orthogonal approaches [10, 24] to other  routing protocols.
When two nodes are in the same connected cloud, DSDV [19] routing is used.
If m of the blocks are received at the  destination, the message can be restored, where m < k. In a uniformly distributed mobility scenario, the delivery probability increases  because the probability that the destination node meets m relays is greater than it meets k relays, given m < k.
