Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within Î”T is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receiver"s storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the  communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages.
For this purpose, we assume that even short contacts are sufficient to exchange messages.1 The probability for node i to meet node j is computed by the following procedure.
All the above effort serves to determine the transfer probability
