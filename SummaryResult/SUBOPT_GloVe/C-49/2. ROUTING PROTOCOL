2.1 Direct Delivery Protocol In this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.
A contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate.
DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their  transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy.
A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the
