To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic network, using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of a production network with more than 5, 000 users.
Those studies help  researchers better understand the theoretical limits of opportunistic networks, and the routing protocol performance in a small network (20-30 nodes).
In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people.
Opportunistic  networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange information.
