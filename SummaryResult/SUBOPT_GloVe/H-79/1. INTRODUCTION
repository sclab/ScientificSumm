Also, the performance of PageRank and other static features has typically been evaluated in the context of a complete system for dynamic ranking, or for other tasks such as question answering.

In this paper, we show there are a number of simple url- or  pagebased features that significantly outperform PageRank (for the purposes of statically ranking Web pages) despite ignoring the structure of the Web.
Despite these , the general belief
