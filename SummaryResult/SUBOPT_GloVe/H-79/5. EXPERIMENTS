For example, the fourth line of the table shows that fRank using the page, popularity, and anchor features outperformed any network that used the page, popularity, and some other feature set, and that the performance of this network was 67.25%.
Table 1: Basic Results Technique Accuracy (%) None (Baseline) 50.00 PageRank 56.70 fRank 67.43 There are a number of decisions that go into the computation of PageRank, such as how to deal with pages that have no outlinks, the choice of Î±, numeric precision, convergence threshold, etc.
In Figure 1 we show the performance of fRank trained with only the popularity
