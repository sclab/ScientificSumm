We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 
We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.
The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.
