For example, in some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction techniques, without writing down the full payoff vectors.
Formalizing a logical-reduction algorithm for matching, or other algorithms that can exploit special  structure among the bids, is a promising avenue for future work. 
The straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible matching problem is linear programming; we set up an  appropriate linear program in Section 5.1.
With n events, to set up the  appropriate linear or integer programs, simply writing out the payoff vectors in the straightforward way requires O(2n ) space.
There is some hope that specialized algorithms that
