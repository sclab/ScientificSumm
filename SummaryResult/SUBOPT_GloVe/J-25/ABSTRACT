The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents" and  auctioneer"s optimization problems.
A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk  exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum.
We show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Î£p 2-complete in the indivisible case.
We develop and motivate the concept of a compound securities market , presenting the framework through a series of
