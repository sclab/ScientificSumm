We also believe the Spectrum  architecture can be applied to any type of document including plain files, but we have yet to work out the details necessary to support this in our prototype environment.
Some of these issues include: â€¢ We envision Spectrum being able to manage content on  systems ranging from large CDNs down to smaller appliances such as TiVO [8].
In order for these smaller systems to  support Spectrum they will require networking and an external API.
Finally , the modular design of the Spectrum architecture allows both stand-alone and distributed realizations so that the system can be
