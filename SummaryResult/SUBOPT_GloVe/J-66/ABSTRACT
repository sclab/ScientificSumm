We formulate the corresponding clearing  problem (deciding how much each bidder pays, and how much each charity receives), and show that it is NP-complete to approximate to any ratio even in very restricted settings.
We then show that the clearing problem for a subclass of concave bids is at least as hard as the decision variant of linear programming.
In both these cases , the limited expressiveness of matching offers causes economic loss : it may happen that an arrangement that would have made all parties ( donators as well as charities ) better off can not be expressed in
