In the case where the ui j are concave, this is easy: if (sl, tl) and (sl+1, tl+1) are endpoints of a finite linear segment in the function, we add the constraint that ui j ≤ tl + πci −sl sl+1−sl (tl+1 − tl).
Using the fact that the function is concave, for each value of πci , the tightest upper bound on ui j is the one corresponding to the segment above that value of πci , and therefore these constraints are sufficient to force the correct value of ui j.
In order to represent this function in the MIP formulation ,
