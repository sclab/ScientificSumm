One of the main reasons for the interest in combinatorial auctions and exchanges is that it allows for expressive bidding.
Compare this to a bidder having to bid on two different items in two different (one-item) auctions, without any way of expressing that (for instance) one item is worthless if the other item is not won.
(This is known as the clearing problem.)
In order to achieve the full economic efficiency allowed by the market '' s expressiveness ( or even come close to it ) , hard computational problems must be solved in combinatorial auctions and exchanges , as
