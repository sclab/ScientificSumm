We showed that an ex-post efficient mechanism is impossible even with only one charity and a very restricted class of bids.
We  formulated the corresponding clearing problem (deciding how much each bidder pays, and how much each charity receives), and showed that it is NP-complete to approximate to any  ratio even in very restricted settings.
We also showed that even though the clearing problem  decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.
We then showed that the clearing problem for a subclass of concave bids is at least
