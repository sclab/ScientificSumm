Most of the experimental work using query-biased  summarization has focused on comparing their value to searchers relative to other types of summary [20, 21], rather than  efficient generation of summaries.
Despite the importance of efficient summary generation in Web search, few algorithms appear in the literature.
To our knowledge, Google was the first  whole-ofWeb search engine to provide query biased summaries, but summarization is listed by Brin and Page [1] only under the heading of future work.
Silber and McKoy [ 19 ] describe a linear-time lexical chaining algorithm for use in generic summaries , but offer no empirical data
