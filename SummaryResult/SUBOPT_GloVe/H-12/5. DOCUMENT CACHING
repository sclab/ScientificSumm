In Section 3 we observed that the Snippet Engine would have its own RAM in proportion to the size of the  document collection.
In addition to the document cache, the RAM of the  Snippet Engine must also hold the CTS decoding table that maps integers to strings, which is capped by a parameter at compression time (1 Gb in our experiments here).
The reason for the large impact of the document cache is 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 020406080100 Cache size ( % of collection ) % ofaccessesascachehits LRU Q=0 LRU Q=10,000 Static Q=0 Static Q=10,000 Figure 4
