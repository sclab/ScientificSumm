In future work, we envision an investigation into how varying the set of sampling methods used and the number of samples controls the trade-off between  robustness, accuracy, and efficiency.
Such variance estimates, for example, may be naturally used in a Bayesian framework for improved model estimation and combination.
The use of sampling is a very flexible and powerful device and is  motivated by our general desire to extend current models of  retrieval by estimating the risk or variance associated with the parameters or output of retrieval processes.
We believe it is likely that any reasonably effective baseline feedback algorithm would
