It is easy to see then that in a perfect cover, each gadget ti contributes cycles  according to the cases above: ti ∈ M, or ti /∈ M. Hence, there exists a perfect 3D-Matching in the original instance. 
It is clear that all vertices are covered, since M partitions X × Y × Z. Conversely, suppose we have a perfect cover by short  cycles.
Instead then, we use the following reduction.
One straightforward idea is to construct a tripartite graph with vertex sets X ∪ Y ∪ Z and directed edges ( xa , yb ) , ( yb ,
