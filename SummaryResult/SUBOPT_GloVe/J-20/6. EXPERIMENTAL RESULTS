In each of the next two algorithms, we turn one of these optimizations off to highlight its effectiveness.
By taking advantage of the properties of our problem, we manage to clear a market with 10,000 patients in about the same time it would otherwise have taken to clear a 6000 patient market. 
As in many column generation problems, the tailing-off effect is substantial.
Column Generation One column at a time.
Finally, we restore the seeder to its optimized setting, but this time, remove the optimality prover described in  Section 5.2.3.
The first algorithm is CPLEX on the full cycle formulation
