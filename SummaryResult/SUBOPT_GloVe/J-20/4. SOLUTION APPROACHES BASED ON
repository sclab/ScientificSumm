Alternatively, we can solve the problem by encoding it as an ILP with one variable for each edge in the original market graph G. This ILP, given below, has the advantage that it can be extended naturally to deal with cycle length constraints.
If so, we generate a set of these constraints, add them to the ILP, and repeat.
In our second constraint generator, we only add one  constraint for such cycles: the sum of edges in the cycle can be at most |c|(L âˆ’ 1)/L .
At each node of the search tree that is visited , this
