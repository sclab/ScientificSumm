Our algorithm replaced CPLEX as the clearing algorithm of the Alliance for Paired Donation, one of the leading  kidney exchanges.
We present the first algorithm capable of clearing these markets on a nationwide scale.
Also, in barter-exchanges generally, more agents are affected if one drops out of a longer cycle.
With over 70,000 patients already waiting for a cadaver kidney in the US, this market is seen as the only ethical way to significantly reduce the 4,000 deaths per year attributed to kidney disease.
Solving it exactly is one of the main challenges in establishing a national kidney exchange.
