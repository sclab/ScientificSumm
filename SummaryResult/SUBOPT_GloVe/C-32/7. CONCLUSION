The main contributions of the paper are: 1. extending cooperative caching techniques to support 37 fine-grain strong-consistency access in high-latency  environments, 2. an implementation of the system prototype that yields strong performance gains over the base system, 3. analytical and measurement based performance  evaluation of the costs and benefits of the new techniques capturing the dominant performance cost, high  network latency. 
The technique improves performance yet provides strong correctness and availability properties in the presence of node failures and slow clients.
