These techniques use the server to provide redirection and do not consider issues of high network  latency.
Multiprocessor systems and distributed shared memory systems [14, 4, 17, 18, 5] use fine-grain coherence techniques to avoid the performance penalty of false sharing but do not address issues of availability when nodes fail.
last-writer-wins policy for broadcast applications, to deal with concurrent updates but is limited to file systems.
The  protocol exploits application specific methods e.g.
In contrast, BuddyCache uses application level multicast and a sender-reliable  coherence protocol to provide similar access latency  improvements for transactional objects.
