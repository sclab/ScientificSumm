Our experiments run in a single server system and therefore, the commit time overhead of version cache management at the client does not contribute in the results presented in the section below.
To gauge these client side overheads in a multiple server  system, we instrumented the version cache implementation to run with a workload trace that included reordered  invalidations and timed the basic operations.
The overall time in the Reader group improves by 30 % and is due to peer fetch that allows a client to access an invalidated object at the cost of a local fetch avoiding the delay
