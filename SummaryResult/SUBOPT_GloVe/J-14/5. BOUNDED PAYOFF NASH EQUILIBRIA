, n. We construct a  strategy profile ti = max{xj i | xj i ≤ si} and use the same  argument as in the proof of Theorem 3 to show that t is a Nash  equilibrium for G. By Lemma 3, we have |EPVi (s) − EPVi (t)| ≤ 24Pmaxδ, so choosing δ < /(24Pmax), or, equivalently, N > max{5n, 24Pmax/ }, we can ensure EPVi (t) ≥ Ti − for i = 1, .
if such a pair of indices exists , we instruct Vn to play xk n and use dynamic programming techniques ( or , equivalently , the downstream pass of the algorithm
