It  follows that to find a Nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff, we have to maximize Pk−1 i=1 Ti subject to conditions u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui) for i = 1, .
It follows that V is indifferent between playing 0 and 1 if and only if w = f(u) = u+1 u+2 .
It is easy to check that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the vector (u, 1/2, f(u)) is a Nash equilibrium.
We have g ( u ) < 0 for g > 3 , g ( u )
