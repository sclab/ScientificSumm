That is, we cannot hope to have an algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium with total payoff at least (1 − )M(G).
Lemma 3 implies Pn i=1 |EPVi (s) − EPVi (t)| ≤ 24nPmaxδ, so by choosing δ < /(24nPmax), or, equivalently, setting N > 24nPmax/ , we can ensure that the total expected payoff for the strategy profile t is within from optimal.
As t is a discrete strategy profile , this means that the strategy profile found by our algorithm will be at least as good as t. Define ml , k i to be the maximum total payoff
