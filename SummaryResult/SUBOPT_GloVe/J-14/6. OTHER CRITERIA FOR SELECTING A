, n, we can find a strategy profile s such that s is a Nash equilibrium for G and Ti − ≤ EPVi (s ) ≤ Ti + for i = 1, .
For example, we may want to ensure that no player gets a negative expected payoff, or that the expected payoff to player i is at least Pi max − ξ, where Pi max is the maximum entry of i"s  payoff matrix and ξ is a fixed parameter.
Namely , for a given > 0 , choose δ as in the proof of Theorem 3 , and let Xi be the
