Then checking if there is a Nash equilibrium in which none of the players assigns a  nonzero probability to his third action is equivalent to checking if there exists a Nash equilibrium that satisfies the payoff bounds in the original game, and Section 5.1 shows that finding an exact solution to this problem requires new ideas.
While we prove our results for games on a path, they can be generalized to any tree for which the best response policies have compact representations as unions of rectangles.
Our approach is different in that we insist on outputting an exact Nash equilibrium
