It seems to be a novel feature of the setting we consider here, that an optimal Nash equilibrium is hard to represent, in a situation where it is easy to find and represent a Nash equilibrium.
If this representation has polynomial size (as is the case for paths, as shown in [9]), one may hope to extract from it a Nash equilibrium with the desired properties.
In fact , for any algebraic number α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] with degree at most n , we exhibit a graphical game on a path of length O ( n )
