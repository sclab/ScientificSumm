In this paper, we consider a topic that has been less studied in the context of automated agent voting, namely power indices.
We also show that for some restricted network flow domains (specifically, of  con1 We use the term in its intuitive sense here, but in the social choice literature, preference aggregation and voting are basically  synonymous.
There are implications in this scenario to real-world networks; for example, the power index might be used to allocate maintenance resources (a more powerful edge being more critical), in order to maintain a given flow of data between two points.
