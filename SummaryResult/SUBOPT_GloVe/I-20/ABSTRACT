The relative power of each edge/agent reflects its significance in enabling such a flow, and in real-world networks could be used, for example, to allocate resources for maintaining parts of the network.
In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of  calculating the Banzhaf power index within a particular multiagent  domain, a network flow game.
We show that calculating the Banzhaf power index of each agent in this network flow domain is #P-complete.
We also show that for some restricted network flow domains there exists a polynomial algorithm to calculate agents" Banzhaf power indices.
