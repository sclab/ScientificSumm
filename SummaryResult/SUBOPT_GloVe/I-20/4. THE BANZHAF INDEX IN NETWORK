In all of this section, we take the input to the #MATCHING problem to be G =< U, V, E > with |U| = |V | = k, the network flow graph constructed in the reduction to be G =< V , E > with capacities c : E â†’ R as defined in Section 4.3, the edge for which to  calculate the Banzhaf index to be ef , and target flow values of k and k + .
# MATCHING : We are given a bipartite graph G = < U , V , E > , such that |U| = |V | = n , and are asked to count
