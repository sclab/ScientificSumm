Since the Shapley value of any simple game has the same value as its Shapley-Shubik index, this shows that  calculating the Shapley-Shubik index in weighted majority games is  #Pcomplete.
The problem of computing power indices in simple games  depends on the chosen representation of the game.
The Shapley-Shubik index [19] is the direct application of the Shapley value to simple coalitional games.
Since the number of possible coalitions is exponential in the number of agents,  calculating power indices in time polynomial in the number of agents can only be achieved in specific domains.
Both the Shapley-Shubik and the Banzhaf indices
