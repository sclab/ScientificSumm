When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the  appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 
Given a coalition C , which controls the edges EC = { ei|i ∈ C } , we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game
