For proving that the  informationtheoretically optimal result is achieved with threshold  strategies, it is sufficient to show that the social-choice function exhibits a single-crossing condition on expectation: given any allocation scheme, and fixing the behavior of the other players, the expected social value in any two actions (as a function of θi) is single crossing.
Our first result is a sufficient and necessary condition for the implementability of the  optimal solution achievable with k actions: this condition says that the optimal social-choice rule is achieved when all the 4 For simplicity, we assume that a maximum is attained and thus the optimal function is well defined.
We will show that for any k-action mechanism, the optimal expected social value is achieved when all  players use threshold strategies.
Then, we can use the multilinearity to show that the social-value loss will always be O( 1 k ) in the mechanisms we construct.
If the valuation functions vi(·, A) are  single crossing and linear in θi for every player i and for every alternative, then the informationally optimal k-action social welfare function is implementable.
For any number of players and alternatives, and for any set of distribution functions of the players" types, if the social-value function g is single crossing and  multilinear, then the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function (with respect to g) incurs an expected social-value loss of O( 1 k2 ).
Then, it will follow from Lemma 1 that the social choice function is implementable.
3.1 Asymptotic Analysis In this section we show that the social value loss of  multilinear social-value rules diminishes quadratically with the number of possible actions, k. This is the same asymptotic ratio presented in the study of specific models in the same spirit [19, 5, 18, 9].
Hence, we assume that the type space is normalized to [0, 1], that is, for every player i, θi = 0 and θi = 1.
For every action bi of player i, let qA denote the  probability that alternative A is allocated, i.e., qA = Pr−→ θ h t(s( −→ θ )) = A|si(θi) = bi i 5 For example, f(x, y, z) = xyz + 5xy + 7.
66 Due to the linearity of expectation, the expected social value when player i with type θi reports bi is: X A∈A qA Eθ−i ( g(θi, θ−i, A) | t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A ) (1) = X A∈A qA Z θ−i g(θi, θ−i, A)fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) (2) where fA −i(θ−i) equals Q j=i fj (θj ) qA for types profiles θ−i such that t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A, and 0 otherwise.
Thus, we can write Equation 2 as: X A∈A qA Z θ−i ` λθ−i θi + βθ−i ´ fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) = X A∈A qA θi Z θ−i λθ−i fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) + Z θ−i βθ−i fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) !
Next, we show that for a wide family of social-value  functions - multilinear functions - the price of implementation is zero.
The basic idea behind the proof of the following theorem is as follows: for every player, we show that the expected social welfare when he chooses any action (fixing the strategies of the other players) is a linear function of his type.
The basic intuition for the proof is that even for this  general framework, we can construct mechanisms where the probability of having an allocation that is incompatible with the original social-choice function is O( 1 k ).
Observe that if the valuation functions of the players are linear and single crossing, then the social-welfare function (i.e., the sum of the players" valuations) is multilinear and single-crossing.
Note that in this argument we characterize the players" strategies that maximize the social value, and not the players" utilities.
Consider a single-crossing social-value  function g. The informationally optimal k-action social-choice function c∗ (with respect to g) is implementable if and only if c∗ achieves its optimum when the players use non-decreasing strategies.
Therefore, each summand, thus the whole function, is a  linear function in θi.
Since g is multilinear, every function g(θi, θ−i, A) is a  linear function in θi, where the coefficients depend on the  values of θ−i.
Therefore, an immediate conclusion from Theorem 1 is that the  optimal social welfare, which is achievable with k actions, is implementable when the valuations are linear.
A multilinear function is a polynomial in which the degree of every variable in each monomial is at most 1.5 We say that a social-choice rule g is multilinear, if g(·, A) is multilinear for every alternative A ∈ A.
The same argument applies to all the players, and  therefore the optimal social value is obtained with threshold strategies.
The basic idea is that with non-decreasing strategies (i.e., threshold strategies), we can apply the single-crossing property to show that when a player raises his reported action, the expected value for his high-priority alternatives increases faster; therefore,  monotonicity must hold.
Assume that the type spaces are normalized to [0, 1].
The implementability of the information-theoretically  optimal solution makes the characterization of the optimal incentive-compatible mechanisms significantly easier: we can apply the standard mechanism-design technique and first calculate the optimal allocation scheme and then find the right payments.
This holds since the single-crossing  conditions on the valuations are defined with a similar order on the alternatives as in the social-value function.
The maximum over a set of linear functions is a piecewise-linear function, hence the  optimal social value is achieved when the player uses threshold strategies (the thresholds are the switching points).
That is, the information-theoretically optimal rule is dominant-strategy implementable.
This will be shown by proving that for any player i and for any action bi of player i, the expected welfare when she chooses the action bi is a  linear function in player i"s type θi.
This is a result of the multilinearity of the social-value function and of the linearity of expectation.
Denote this function by g(θi, θ−i, A) = λθ−i θi + βθ−i .
For all types between subsequent thresholds, the optimum is clearly achieved by a single action; Since linear functions are single-crossing, every action will be maximal in at most one interval.
Theorem 1 shows that this requirement holds for multilinear functions, but we were not able to give an exact characterization of this general class of functions.
(It is easy to illustrate that this result does not hold if the players" types are dependent.)
For example, in the social choice function that chooses the same alternative for any type profile, no loss will be incurred (even with 0 actions).
Observe that the proof of Theorem 1 actually works for a more general setting.
In this expression, each integral is a constant  independent of θi when the strategies of the other player are fixed.
For achieving the optimal expected social value, the player must choose the action that maximizes the expected social value.
Since the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies, we can apply Lemma 1 to show the monotonicity of this  socialchoice rule.
(This fact holds for all single-crossing social-choice functions, not only for multilinear functions.)
players use non-decreasing strategies.
That is, there exists a set of distribution functions for the players (the uniform distribution in particular) and there are social-value functions (e.g., auctions) for which any mechanism incurs a social-value loss of at least Ω( 1 k2 ).
In that sense, auctions are the hardest problems with respect to the incurred loss.
If the social-value function is multilinear and single crossing, the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function is implementable.
These breaking points are the thresholds to be used by the player.
Our proof is constructive - we present an explicit construction for a mechanism that exhibits the desired loss in dominant strategies.
The result holds for any number of  players and alternatives, and for any profile of distribution  functions on the players" types, as long as they are statistically independent.
A maximum of k linear functions is a piecewise-linear function with at most k−1 breaking points.
The main challenge here, compared to earlier results, is in dealing with the general  mechanismdesign framework, that allows a large family of social-value functions for any number of players and alternatives.
NUMBER OF ACTIONS In this section, we study the general model of  actionbounded mechanism design.
Yet, note that this claim does not imply that the loss of any social-choice function will be  proportional to 1 k2 .
As  opposed to the specific models, the social-value function may be asymmetric with respect to the players" types; for  instance, the social-value loss may a-priori occur in any  entry (i.e., profile of actions).
Moreover, as discussed in [4], this bound is asymptotically tight.
The additive expected social-value depends on the length of the support of the type space.
This family of  functions captures many common settings from the literature.
Taken together, the expected loss becomes O( 1 k2 ).
