This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an  equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].
The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the  optimal expected social-value?
are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy  equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a  similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space).
That is, for some realizations of the players" types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can  approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a  standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players" types.
We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two  alternatives.
Multilinear social-value functions capture many  important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the routing example given above, and any social welfare  function in which the players" valuations are linear in their types (such as public-goods and auctions).
When direct  revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to  report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built.
Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts  attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a player"s action space is identical to his type space.
In this work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence of such restrictions.
The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main  diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).
Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing  socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and  players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in dominant strategies.
A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a  social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice  function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents" types into a chosen alternative.
We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold  strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best  socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.
In  Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for  2player environments with two alternative.
Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.
A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0.
Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to  require them to report their accurate loss rates.
The social-choice function c will therefore choose an  alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.
That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9.
We show that the  optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal  allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to  potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.
Achieving a full characterization of the optimal  actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder.
The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal  information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).
We  complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.
Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a  special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players" valuations for the chosen alternative.
We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy  implementation incurs no additional cost.
However, in environments with restricted  action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.
Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical  constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]).
1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.
For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ).
Since the payments in a  dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.
A classic result in this  setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents" preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players" types.
Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.
The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players" types) to a single alternative.
Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players" messages.
Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].
Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.
We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.
The social choice  function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2.
Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.
What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium?
Mechanism design is a sub-field of game theory that  studies how to design rules of games resulting in desirable  outcomes, when the players are rational.
1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very  common in the literature.
Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most.
In some situations, firms are not willing, or cannot, run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for some product or service.
The other question involves  gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.
Restrictions on the action space, for specific models, were studied in several earlier papers.
To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players.
First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.
The social planner cannot access the private data of the players, and can only learn about it from the players" actions.
Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted.
Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ).
Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal  informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.
In many similar settings, players might be also reluctant to reveal their accurate types, but willing to disclose partial  information about them.
In a standard  setting, players hold some private information - their types - and choose actions from their action spaces to  maximize their utilities.
This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific  environments in [19, 9, 5].
They  characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with very strict limitations on the action space.
to a  general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models.
To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero.
Assume now that the players  cannot send their entire secret data, but can only choose an action out of two possible actions (e.g., 0 or 1).
The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).
For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future  transactions.
Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods.
We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].
Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.
The buyers in such environemnts face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they may have an infinite number of possible values for the item.
For example, a government that wishes to  undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.
These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the  optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium?
We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.
The implementability of the information-theoretically  optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal  socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.
Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).
Due to lack of space, some of the proofs are missing and can be found in the full version that can be found on the authors" web pages. 
The social planner aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits  exceeds the construction cost of the bridge.
And if not, to what  extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?
Other work  studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14].
There are various reasons for such strict restrictions on the action spaces.
Consider, for  example, the well-studied screening model, where an  insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information.
However, we know that in some settings (e.g.,  auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.
This result is achieved in dominant strategies.
In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.
62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social  planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.
We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al.
A sender wishes to send his message through the  network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.
The work of Blumrosen, Nisan and Segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to this paper.
One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.
This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).
The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.
Note that this question is  actually composed of two separate questions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.
They studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed to send messages with severely bounded size.
In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several  wellstudied models.
Consider a network that is  composed of two links in parallel.
(The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)
Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al.
• Single-item auctions.
Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.
• Routing in networks.
