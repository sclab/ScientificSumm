Currently, we are  developing another edge indexing method to make the indexing  complexity constant.
Our edge indexing model, however, can overcome such higher indexing complexity by indexing spatial extensions at edge-level not at node-level in a grid partitioned sub-world and was validated through quantitative analyses and simulations.
Compared with the traditional view model, our new view model promises to eliminate any object popping problem that can easily be observed in existing virtual environments at the expense of increased  indexing complexity.
However, for now our edge indexing still retains a higher  complexity, even in a two-dimensional domain.
To support dynamic extensibility and scalability in highly dynamic environments, we proposed a new view paradigm, the object-initiated view model, and its efficient indexing method, edge indexing.
Once indexing complexity becomes constant, we plan to index 3D spatial extensions and multi-resolutional  geometry data.
We expect that our edge indexing can contribute to  successful deployment of next-generation gaming environments.
