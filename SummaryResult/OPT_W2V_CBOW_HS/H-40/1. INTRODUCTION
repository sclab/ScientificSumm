1 CLQS can be approached as a query translation problem, i.e., to suggest the queries that are translations of the original query.
A natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the queries in the source language and the queries in the target language, by using the query log of a search engine.
Query suggestion is a functionality to help users of a search engine to better specify their information need, by narrowing down or expanding the scope of the search with synonymous queries and relevant queries, or by suggesting related queries that have been frequently used by other users.
In this paper, we propose a method of calculating the similarity between source language query and the target language query by exploiting, in addition to the translation information, a wide spectrum of bilingual and monolingual information, such as term co-occurrences, query logs with click-through data, etc.
It has wide applications on World Wide Web: for cross-language search or for suggesting relevant bidding terms in a different language.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work; Section 3 describes in detail the discriminative model for estimating cross-lingual query similarity; Section 4 presents a new CLIR approach using cross-lingual query suggestion as a bridge across language boundaries.
But different from query expansion, query suggestion aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users so that the query integrity and coherence are preserved in the suggested queries.
CLQS aims to suggest related queries but in a different language.
Search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, all have implemented query suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search method.
In particular, if the user intends to perform CLIR, then original query is even more likely to have its correspondent included in the target language query log.
By suggesting the related and frequently used formulations, it is hoped that the new query can cover more relevant documents.
However, these kinds of approaches usually rely on static knowledge and data.
We exploit the fact that the users of search engines in the same period of time have similar interests, and they submit queries on similar topics in different languages.
For instance, the translated terms can be reasonable translations, but they are not popularly used in the target language.
Typical methods for query suggestion exploit query logs and document collections, by assuming that in the same period of time, many users share the same or similar interests, which can be expressed in different manners [12, 14, 26].
Therefore, there exist many mismatch cases between the translated terms and the really used terms in target language.
In addition, the same technology has been leveraged to recommend bidding terms to online advertiser in the  pay-forperformance search market [12].
However, all of the existing studies dealt with monolingual query suggestion and to our knowledge, there is no published study on cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS).
This mismatch makes the suggested terms in the target language ineffective.
Query suggestion is closely related to query expansion which extends the original query with new search terms to narrow the scope of the search.
Besides being benchmarked as an independent module, the resulting CLQS system is tested as a new means of query translation in CLIR task on TREC collections.
It cannot effectively reflect the quickly shifting interests of Web users.
A discriminative model is used to learn the cross-lingual query similarity based on a set of manually translated queries.
The results show that this new translation method is more effective than the traditional query translation method.
Moreover, there are some problems with translated queries in target language.
As a result, a query written in a source language likely has an equivalent in a query log in the target language.
The model is trained by optimizing the cross-lingual similarity to best fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other query"s translation.
Therefore, if a candidate for CLQS appears often in the query log, then it is more likely the appropriate one to be suggested.
For example, the French query aliment biologique is translated into biologic food by Google translation tool2 , yet the correct formulation nowadays should be organic food.
Dictionaries, large size of parallel corpora and existing commercial machine translation systems can be used for translation.
Section 5 discusses the experiments and benchmarks; finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.
