In [1], the target language query log has been exploited to help query translation in CLIR. 
In addition, word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19].
Query logs have been successfully used for monolingual IR [8, 12, 15, 26], especially in monolingual query suggestions [12] and relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion [8, 15].
This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18].
CLQS is different from CLQE in that it aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users in another language.
In [7, 27], OOV term translations are mined from the Web using a search engine.
As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language.
[16] develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the  crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts.
Most approaches to CLIR perform a query translation followed by a monolingual IR.
Therefore, CLQS also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the common formulations of similar topics in the target language.
Despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and translation disambiguation are the two major bottlenecks for CLIR [20].
Indeed, in many cases, it is helpful to introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any query word, but are closely related to the meaning of the query.
[18] makes performance comparison on multiple CLQE techniques, including pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion.
[2] reports the enhancement on CLIR by post-translation expansion.

Typically, queries are translated either using a bilingual dictionary [22], a machine translation software [9] or a parallel corpus [20].
In [17], bilingual knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis.
However, there is lack of a unified framework to combine the wide spectrum of resources and recent advances of mining techniques for CLQE.
