This paper describes how the FORe can be applied to allow interoperability among agents that have different reputation models.
Solutions to this problem have been proposed by the way of trust models where agents are endowed with a model of other agents that allows them to decide if they can or cannot trust another agent.
Casare and Sichman [2][3] proposed a Functional Ontology of Reputation (FORe) and some directions about how it could be used to allow the interoperability among different agent reputation models.
Such trust decision is very important because it is an essential condition to the formation of agents' cooperation.
The trust decision processes use the concept of reputation as the basis of a decision.
Open multiagent systems (MAS) are composed of autonomous distributed agents that may enter and leave the agent society at their will because open systems have no centralized control over the development of its parts [1].
These features are interesting to obtain flexible and adaptive systems but they also create new risks about the reliability and the robustness of the system.
Reputation is a subject that has been studied in several works [4][5][8][9] with different approaches, but also with different semantics attached to the reputation concept.
Since agents are considered as autonomous entities, we cannot assume that there is a way to control their internal behavior.
An outline of this approach is sketched in the context of a testbed for the experimentation and comparison of trust models, the ART testbed [6].
