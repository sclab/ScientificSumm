The Smart Event  Assistant is entirely realized as a MAS system providing, among other functionality, various filter agents and different service provider agents, which together with the user agents utilize the functionality provided by our approach.
Taken together, these improvements result in a filtering process that takes about three times as long as the respective  nonprivacy-preserving filtering process, which we regard as an acceptable trade-off for the increased level of privacy.
Because these additional parameters are not seen as privacy-critical (as they are not based on the user  profile, but rather constitute a short-term information need), the relevant part of the provider profile may be propagated as a whole, with no need for complex interactions.
prior to the user"s request, and by an efficient retrieval of the relevant 3 The Smart Event Assistant may be accessed online via http://www.smarteventassistant.de.
In the  nonprivacy-preserving version, an agent retrieves the profiles directly and propagates the result to a provider agent.
by utilizing a  centralized architecture in which the privacy-preserving  providerside functionality is realized as trusted software based on trusted computing.

Because the user is not online during these interactions, they are less critical with regard to performance and the protracted  duration of the information filtering process is acceptable in this case.
Because agent platforms can be utilized for a large variety of tasks, and because we see trusted  computing as the most promising approach to realize secure and trusted agent environments, it seems reasonable to assume that these respective mechanisms will be generally available in the future, independent of specific solutions such as the one described here.
An intelligent day planner integrates all  functionality by providing personalized recommendations for the  various information services, based on the user"s preferences and taking into account the location of the user as well as the potential venues.
In this scenario, the overall performance is substantially improved by setting up the relay agent and the TFE agent oﬄine, i.e.

Overall, a single information filtering process takes about ten times longer than a non-privacy-preserving information  filtering process leading to the same results, which is a  considerable overhead but still acceptable under certain conditions, as described in the following section.
In our solution, only a comparatively small part of the overall system is based on trusted computing.
However, we consider these approaches to be unsuitable because they are far less generic: Whenever some part of the respective software is patched, upgraded or replaced, the entire system has to be analyzed again in order to determine its trustworthiness, a process that is  problematic in itself due to its complexity.

Performance is a critical issue, mainly because of the overhead caused by creating additional agents and agent platforms for controlling communication, and by the  additional interactions within the Recommender Module.

Privacy aspects are directly addressed by the modules and protocols described above and therefore not evaluated  further here.
For the evaluation of our approach, we have examined whether and to which extent the requirements (mainly  regarding privacy, performance, and quality) are actually met.

Additional services, such as a calendar, a  routing service and news services complement the information services.
Recommendations generated for the intelligent day planner, however, have to be delivered with very little latency because the process is triggered by the user, who expects to receive results promptly.
Recommendations are generated in two ways: A push  service delivers new recommendations to the user in regular intervals (e.g.
There are more straightforward ways to realize privacy-preserving IF, e.g.
Because equivalent filtering techniques have been  applied successfully in regular Recommender Systems [9], there are no negative consequences with regard to the quality of the recommendations.
In these scenarios, a direct content-based filtering technique similar to the one described in Section 4.3 is  applied.
