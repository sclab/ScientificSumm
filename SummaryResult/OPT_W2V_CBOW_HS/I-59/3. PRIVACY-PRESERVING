3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.
Whereas in some applications the provider and filter entities  explicitly trust each other, because they are deployed by the same party, our solution is applicable more generically because it does not require any trust between the main abstract  entities.
Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to  control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.
because the respective  entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined  environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external  manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually  acquired temporarily only.
The  entities introduced above are mapped directly to agents, and the trusted environment in which they exist is realized in the form of agent platforms.
• Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the  communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.
It is possible, however, to expand a MAS architecture and to provide designated agents with this ability.
These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and  single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the  offered information accordingly.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 321 • Finally, a separate module described in Section 4.4 provides Exemplary Filtering Techniques in order to show that various restrictions imposed on filtering techniques by our approach may actually be fulfilled.
User profile data is propagated without  participation of the provider entity from the user entity to the TFE via the relay entity.
We are now able to specify the abstract information  filtering protocol as shown in Figure 1: The filter entity deploys a Temporary Filter Entity (TFE) operating in a trusted  environment.
In both cases, trust may be established in various ways.
General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.
Trust in this regard may be  established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified.
MAS architectures are an ideal solution for realizing a distributed system characterized by these features, because they provide agents constituting entities that are actually characterized by autonomy, mobility and the ability to  communicate [26], as well as agent platforms as environments providing means to realize the security of agents.
• Provider Privacy: No information about provider  profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.
Additionally, the  propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.
Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.
INFORMATION FILTERING We identify three main abstract entities participating in an information filtering process within a distributed system: A user entity, a provider entity, and a filter entity.
Provider profile data is propagated from the provider entity to the TFE via the  relay entity.
• The Transparent Persistence Module facilitates the use of different data storage mechanisms, and  provides a uniform interface for accessing persistent  information, which may be utilized for monitoring critical interactions involving potentially private information e.g.
In addition to the MAS architecture itself, which is  assumed as given, our solution consists of the following five main modules: • The Controller Module described in Section 4.1  provides functionality for controlling the communication capabilities of agents.
In this context, the issue of malicious hosts, i.e.
Our approach requires each entity in the distributed  architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e.
Sets of  recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.
Thus, it is possible to ensure that the  controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information.
The trusted environment introduced above encompasses the MAS architecture itself and the Controller Module, which have to be trusted to act in a non-malicious manner in order to rule out the possibility of malicious hosts. 
In the second stage (steps 2.1 to 2.3 of Figure 1), the provider entity establishes control of both relay and TFE, and thus prevents them from  propagating provider profile information.
it is trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective information itself).
Temporary acquisition of private information is permitted as well.
the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly  because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities.
3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user  profiles should be acquired permanently by any other  entity or external party, including other user entities.
The filter entity provides the  recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information.
Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information.
In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.
In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects,  performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be  addressed as well.
• Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired  permanently by any other entity or external party.
largely independent of other entities (e.g.
Additionally, the environment itself is trusted not to act in a malicious manner (e.g.
hosts attacking agents, has to be addressed explicitly.
Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third  parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted  computing mechanisms may be used.
In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects  related to information collection and processing, i.e.
While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements.
In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.
Furthermore, existing MAS architectures generally do not allow agents to control the communication of other agents.
Again, temporary acquisition of  private information is permitted.
The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.
Its description is outside the scope of this paper.
if they  cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.
The user entity deploys an additional relay entity operating in the same environment.
Its description is outside the scope of this paper.
All communication across the environments indicated by dashed lines is  prevented with the exception of communication with the controlling entity.
Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e.
It additionally utilizes social  aspects of MAS technology.
Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing  mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.
