As described in the following section, there are several approaches with similar goals, but none of these provide a generic approach in which the privacy of all parties is preserved.
Similar considerations also apply to the  information provider, who may want to control the  dissemination of the provided information, and to the provider of the filtering techniques, who may not want the details of the  utilized filtering algorithms to become common knowledge.
In  Section 5, we evaluate the approach, mainly via the realized application.
Our approach is based on Multi-Agent System (MAS) technology because fundamental features of agents such as autonomy, adaptability and the ability to communicate are essential requirements of our approach.
In this paper, we focus on the Recommender  System functionality.
The aspect of privacy is an essential issue in all IF systems: Generating personalized information obviously requires the use of personal data.
We have developed an agent-based approach for  privacypreserving IF which has been utilized for realizing a  combined Recommender/Matchmaker System as part of an  application supporting users in planning entertainment-related activities.
According to surveys indicating major privacy concerns of users in the context of Recommender Systems and e-commerce in general [23], users can be  expected to be less reluctant to provide personal information if they trust the system to be privacy-preserving with regard to personal data.
Depending on the respective goal, the resulting systems constitute Recommender Systems [5], Matchmaker Systems [10], or a combination thereof.
The provided body of information is usually structured and collected in provider profiles.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes related work.
Information Filtering (IF) systems aim at countering  information overload by extracting information that is  relevant for a given user out of a large body of information available via an information provider.
A privacy-preserving IF system should therefore balance these requirements and protect the privacy of all parties involved in a multilateral way, while addressing general requirements regarding performance, security and quality of the  recommendations as well.
Filtering  techniques operate on these profiles in order to generate  recommendations of items that are probably relevant for a given user, or in order to determine users with similar interests, or both.
In contrast to  Information Retrieval (IR) systems, where relevant information is extracted based on search queries, IF architectures  generate personalized information based on user profiles  containing, for each given user, personal data, preferences, and rated items.
In other words, the realized approach does not merely  constitute a solution for privacy-preserving IF within a MAS context, but rather utilizes a MAS architecture in order to realize a solution for privacy-preserving IF, which could not be realized easily otherwise.
Section 6 concludes the paper with an outlook and outlines further work. 
Section 3 describes the general ideas of our approach.
In Section 4, we describe essential details of the 319 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS modules of our approach and their implementation.
