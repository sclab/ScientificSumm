Various enforcement mechanisms have been suggested that are applicable in the context of privacy-preserving  Information Filtering, such as enterprise privacy policies [17] or hippocratic databases [1], both of which annotate user data with additional meta-information specifying how the data is to be handled on the provider side.
In [3], an agent-based architecture for privacy-preserving demographic filtering is described which may be  generalized in order to support other kinds of filtering techniques.
There is a large amount of work in related areas, such as Private Information Retrieval [7], Privacy-Preserving Data Mining [2], and other privacy-preserving protocols [4, 16], most of which is based on Secure Multi-Party Computation [27].
While in some aspects similar to our approach, this  architecture addresses at least two aspects inadequately, namely the protection of the filter against manipulation attempts, and the prevention of collusions between the filter and the provider. 
In [19],  various approaches are integrated within a single architecture.
Trusted computing, as specified by the Trusted Computing Group, aims at  realizing trusted systems by increasing the security of open  systems to a level comparable with the level of security that is achievable in closed systems.
These approaches ultimately assume that the provider actually intends to  protect the privacy of the user data, and offer support for this task, but they are not intended to prevent the provider from acting in a malicious manner.
In [10], an agent-based approach is described in which user agents representing similar users are discovered via a  transitive traversal of user agents.
We have ruled out Secure Multi-Party Computation approaches mainly because of their complexity, and because the algorithm that is computed securely is not considered to be private in these approaches.
There are some approaches for privacy-preserving  Recommender Systems based on distributed collaborative filtering, in which recommendations are generated via a public model aggregating the distributed user profiles without containing explicit information about user profiles themselves.
Some example applications, including peer-to-peer networks, distributed firewalls, and distributed computing in general, are listed in [13].
Privacy is preserved through pseudonymous interaction between the agents and through adding obfuscating data to personal information.
It is based on a  combination of tamper-proof hardware and various software  components.
This is achieved via Secure Multi-Party Computation [6], or via random perturbation of the user data [20].
More  recent related approaches are described in [18].
