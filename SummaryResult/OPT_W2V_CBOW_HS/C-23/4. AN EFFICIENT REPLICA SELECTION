This allows the same data pathways to be used for multiple file transfers.
The replica selection server sends the possible destination locations to the information server, which provides performance measurements and predictions of the three system factors described below.
In our model, we consider three system factors that affect replica selection: Network bandwidth: This is one of the most significant Data Grid factors since data files in Data Grid environments are usually very large.
The client first logins in at a local site and executes the Data Grid platform application, which checks to see if the files are available at the local site.
The seven system parameters our replica selection cost model considers are: Scorei-j: the score value represents how efficiently a user or application at node i can acquire a replica from node j BW jiP : percentage of bandwidth available from node i to node j; current bandwidth divided by highest theoretical bandwidth BBW : network bandwidth weight defined by the Data Grid administrator CPU jP : percentage of node j CPU idle states WCPU : CPU load weight defined by the Data Grid administrator OI jP / : percentage of node j I/O idle states WI/O : I/O state weight defined by the Data Grid administrator We define the following general formula using these system factors.
Transmission Time: Transmission time is measured from the time when the client starts transferring to the time when all transmission jobs are finished, and it includes the time 800 required for resetting data channels between transfer requests.
4.2 System Factors Determining the best database from many with the same replications is a significant problem.
4.4 Co-Allocation Cost Analysis When clients download datasets using GridFTP co-allocation technology, three time costs are incurred: the time required for client authentication to the GridFTP server, actual data transmission time, and data block reassembly time.
OIOI j CPUCPU j BWBW jiji WPWPWPScore // (1) The three influencing factors in this formula: WBW , WCPU , and WI/O describe CPU, I/O, and network bandwidth weights, which can be determined by Data Grid organization administrators according to the various attributes of the storage systems in Data Grid nodes since some storage equipment does not affect CPU loading.
If the I/O state of a site that we wish to download files from is very busy, it will directly affect data transfer performance.
4.3 Our Replica Selection Cost Model The target function of a cost model for distributed and replicated data storage is the information score from the information service.
We assume node i is the local site the user or application logs in on, and node j possesses the replica the user or application wants.
When the application finishes, it returns the results to the user.
Combination Time: Co-allocation architecture exploits the partial copy feature of the GridFTP data movement tool to enable data transfers across multiple connections.
The replica selection server chooses better replica locations according to these estimates and returns location information to the transfer application, which receives the replica through GridFTP.
CPU loading is a dynamic system factor, and a heavy system CPU load will certainly affect data file downloads process from the site.
If they are present at the local site, the application accesses them immediately; otherwise, it passes the logical file names to the replica catalog server, which returns a list of physical locations for all registered copies.
Data files in Data Grids are huge.
The application passes this list of replica locations to a replica selection server, which identifies the storage system destination locations for all candidate data transfer operations.
When we performed data transfers using the GridFTP protocol we discovered that CPU and I/O statuses slightly affect data transfer performance.
I/O state: Data Grid nodes consist of different heterogeneous storage systems.
Authentication Time: Before a transfer, the client must load a Globus proxy and authenticate itself to the GridFTP server with specified user credentials.
SERVICE We constructed a replica selection service to enable clients to select the better replica servers in Data Grid environments.
In other words, data file transfer times are tightly dependent on network bandwidth situations.
Data pathways need be opened only once and may handle many transfers before being closed.
When these file sections are delivered, they may need to be reassembled; the reassembly operation incurs an additional time cost. 
4.1 Replica Selection Scenario Our proposed replica selection model is illustrated in [23], which shows how a client identifies the best location for a desired replica transfer.
When the channel has been established, the data begins flowing.
CPU load: Grid platforms consist of numbers of heterogeneous systems, built with different system architectures, e.g., cluster platforms, supercomputers, PCs.
With partial file transfer, file sections can be retrieved from data servers by specifying only the section start and end offsets.
After several experimental measurements, we determined that network bandwidth is the most significant factor directly influencing data transfer times.
Because network bandwidth is an unstable dynamic factor, we must measure it frequently and predict it as accurately as possible.
The client then establishes a control channel, sets up transfer parameters, and requests data channel creation.
The measurement of it is done by the Globus Toolkit / MDS.
However, data channels must be explicitly reset between transfer requests.
The Network Weather Service (NWS) is a powerful toolkit for this purpose.
Their respective values in our Data Grid environment are 80%, 10%, and 10%.
We listed some influencing factors for our cost model in the preceding section.
This is less time-costly.
We measure I/O states using sysstat [15] utilities.
However, we must express these factors in mathematical notation for further analysis.
See below for a detailed description.
