Subjects also remarked that they would like to see query-based summaries for each suggested destination to support more informed selection, as well as categorization of destinations with capability of drill-down for each category.
We were surprised to learn that subjects did not find the popularity bars useful, or hardly used the within-site search functionality, inviting re-design of these components.
The post-search questionnaire asked subjects to select from a list of proposed explanations (or offer their own explanations) as to why they used recommended query refinements.
Destination systems, in particular QueryDestination, performed best for the exploratory search tasks, where subjects may have benefited from exposure to additional information sources whose topical relevance to the search query is indirect.
The positive response to destination suggestions from the study subjects provides interesting directions for design refinements.
For both known-item tasks and the exploratory tasks, around 40% of subjects indicated that they selected a query suggestion because they wanted to save time typing a query, while less than 10% of subjects did so because the suggestions represented new ideas.
The quality of the destinations appeared to affect subjects" perceptions of them and their task performance.
From examination of the queries that subjects entered for the known-item searches across all systems, they appeared to use the initial query as a starting point, and add or subtract individual terms depending on search results.
The promising findings of our study suggest that systems offering popular destinations lead to more successful and efficient searching compared to query suggestion and unaided Web search.
Thus, subjects seemed to view QuerySuggestion as a time-saving convenience, rather than a way to dramatically impact search effectiveness.
If the initial query does not retrieve relevant information, then subjects 22 F(2,355) = 4.67, p = .01; Tukey post-hoc tests: p = .006 23 Tukey"s post-hoc tests: all p ≤ .027 24 QD: MK = 1.8, ME = 2.1; SD: MK = 1.1, ME = 1.2; F(1,231) = 5.49, p = .02; Tukey post-hoc tests: all p ≤ .003; (M represents mean average).
As with QuerySuggestion, subjects were asked to offer explanations for why they selected destinations.
Over both task types they suggested that destinations were clicked because they grabbed their attention (40%), represented new ideas (25%), or users couldn"t find what they were looking for (20%).
The two variants of recommending destinations that we considered, QueryDestination and SessionDestination, offered suggestions that differed in their temporal proximity to the current query.
As discussed earlier, domains residing at the end of a complete search session (as in SessionDestination) are more likely to be unrelated to the current query, and thus are less likely to constitute valuable suggestions.
Subjects seemed to prefer QuerySuggestion for the known-item tasks where the information-seeking goal was well-defined.
appreciate support in deciding what refinements to make to the query.
The least popular responses were wanted to save time typing the address (7%) and the destination was popular (3%).
Since QuerySuggestion and QueryDestination perform well in distinct task scenarios, integrating both in a single system is an interesting future direction.
We hope to deploy some of these ideas on Web scale in future systems, which will allow log-based evaluation across large user pools.
