In this paper, we 296 present an alternative algorithm for this integer program that can clear markets with over 10,000 patients (and that same number of willing donors).
In contrast, the natural formulations of the kidney exchange problem (with L = 3) take at least cubic space in the number of patients to even model, and therefore memory becomes a bottleneck much before time does when using standard tree search, such as  branch-andcut in CPLEX, to tackle the problem.
The clearing problem is to find a maximum-weight  exchange consisting of cycles with length at most some small constant L. This cycle-length constraint arises naturally for several reasons.
For example, in a kidney exchange, all operations in a cycle have to be performed simultaneously; otherwise a donor might back out after his incompatible partner has received a kidney.
The waiting list currently has over 70,000 people, and the median waiting time ranges from 2 to 5 years, depending on blood type.1 For many patients with kidney disease, the best option is to find a living donor, that is, a healthy person willing to donate one of his/her two kidneys.
In this paper, we present the first algorithm capable of clearing these markets on a nationwide scale.
Allowing cycles of length more than 3 often leads to no improvement in the size of the exchange [15].
Although there are  marketplaces for buying and selling living-donor kidneys, the commercialization of human organs is almost universally  regarded as unethical, and the practice is often explicitly  illegal, such as in the US.
A cycle c in this graph represents a possible swap, with each agent in the cycle obtaining the item of the next agent.
The number of live donations would have been much higher if it were not for the fact that, frequently, a potential donor 1 Data from the United Network for Organ Sharing [21].
An exchange is a collection of disjoint cycles.
For many years, there has even been a large shoe exchange in the United States [10].
(On a 1GB computer and a realistic standard instance generator, discussed later, CPLEX 10.010 runs out of memory on five of the ten  900patient instances and ten of the ten 1,000-patient instances that we generated.)
Or, if for various (e.g., ethical) reasons one requires a  maximum cardinality exchange, one can at least in a second pass find the solution (out of all maximum cardinality solutions) that has the fewest 3-cycles.
More generally, an agent may drop out of a cycle if his preferences have changed, or he/she simply fails to  fulfill his obligations (such as sending a book to another agent in the cycle) due to forgetfulness.
The weight wc of a cycle c is the sum of its edge weights.

The  market has 4 cycles, c1 = v1, v2 , c2 = v2, v3 , c3 = v3, v4 and c4 = v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 , and two (inclusion) maximal  exchanges, namely M1 = {c4} and M2 = {c1, c3}.
However, the kidney  exchange clearing problem (with a limit of 3 or more on  cycle size) is different from the combinatorial auction clearing problem in significant ways.
However, there are now a few regional kidney exchanges in the United States, in which patients can swap their  incompatible donors with each other, in order to each obtain a compatible donor.
Other  variations one can solve for include finding various forms of fault tolerant (non-disjoint) collections of cycles in the event that certain pairs that were thought to be compatible turn out to be incompatible after all.
Whilst this does not hold for general barter exchanges, or even for all kidney exchange markets, in Section 5.2.3 we make use of the observation that short cycles suffice to  dramatically increase the speed of our algorithm.
This gives rise to a logistical constraint on cycle size: even if all the donors are operated on first and the same personnel and facilities are used to then operate on the donees, a k-cycle requires between 3k and 6k doctors, around 4k nurses, and almost 2k operating rooms.
Leg amputees have a separate exchange to share the cost of buying a single pair of shoes.
Another motivation for short cycles is that if the cycle fails to exchange, fewer agents are affected.
It has been  reported to us that the market could be almost double this size.
Section 3 contains a proof that the market  clearing decision problem is NP-complete.
In the past, the incompatible donor was sent home, leaving the patient to wait for a deceased-donor  kidney.
We also detail in those sections our techniques used to solve those programs on large instances.
For example, if 3-cycles are believed to be more likely to fail than 2-cycles, then one can simply give them a weight that is  appropriately lower than 3/2 the weight of a 2-cycle.
(Furthermore, in a simplified theoretical model, any kidney exchange can be converted into one with cycles of length at most 4 [15].)
Secondly, the exchanges were restricted to length-2  cycles (because that is all that can be modeled as maximum matching, and solved using Edmonds"s algorithm).
These markets are examples of barter exchanges.
These swaps consist of cycles of agents, with each agent receiving the item of the next agent in the cycle.
The quality of life on dialysis can be extremely low, and in fact many patients opt to withdraw from dialysis, leading to a natural death.
During this time, almost 30,000 people were added to the national waiting list, while only 9,913 people left the list after receiving a  deceaseddonor kidney.
The weight of an exchange is the sum of its cycle weights.
This has been demonstrated on kidney exchange markets with 100 patients by using CPLEX to solve an integer-program encoding of the clearing problem [15].
The most important difference is that the natural formulations of the combinatorial  auction problem tend to easily fit in memory, so time is the bottleneck in practice.
Kidney failure results in accumulation of this waste, which leads to death in months.
One treatment option is dialysis, in which the patient goes to a hospital to have his/her blood filtered by an external machine.
People with different-sized feet use this to avoid having to buy two pairs of shoes.
In a barter-exchange market, agents (patients) seek to swap their items (incompatible donors) with each other.
Add a weighted edge e from one agent vi to another vj, if vi wants the item of vj.
Sections 4 and 5 each contain an ILP formulation of the clearing problem.
For each, we develop a host of (mainly  problemspecific) techniques that dramatically improve both runtime and memory usage.
For  example, last-minute testing in a kidney exchange often reveals new incompatibilities that were not detected in the initial testing (based on which the compatibility graph was  constructed).
• Second, an attractive feature of using an ILP  formulation is that it allows one to easily model a number of variations on the objective, and to add additional  constraints to the problem.
Instead, the preferred treatment is a kidney transplant.
For example,  using Edmond"s maximum-matching algorithm [4], [20] shows that a national pairwise-exchange market (using length-2  cycles only) would result in more transplants, reduced waiting time, and savings of $750 million in heath care costs over 5 years.
Those results are conservative in two ways.
In both settings, the idea is to gather all the pertinent information about the agents into a central clearing point and to run a centralized clearing algorithm to determine the allocation.
In the United States in 2005, 4,052 people died waiting for a life-saving kidney transplant.
Kidney transplants are by far the most common transplant.
Due to such resource constraints, the upcoming national kidney exchange market will likely allow only cycles of length 2 and 3.
Both  problems are NP-hard.
Finally, we present our conclusions in Section 8, and suggest future research directions. 
Unfortunately, the demand for kidneys far outstrips supply.
The weight we of e represents the utility to vi of obtaining vj"s item.
Section 2 discusses the process by which we generate realistic kidney exchange market data, in order to benchmark the clearing algorithms.
However, in most countries, live donation is legal, provided it occurs as a gift with no  financial compensation.
Firstly, the simulated market contained only 4,000 initial patients, with 250 patients added every 3 months.
One approach then might be to look for a good heuristic or  approximation algorithm.
However, for two reasons, we aim for an exact algorithm based on an integer-linear program (ILP) formulation, which we solve using specialized tree search.
Therefore, the approaches that have been developed for combinatorial auctions cannot handle the kidney exchange problem.
In Section 3, we show that (the decision version of) the clearing problem is NP-complete for L ≥ 3.
Several visits are required per week, and each takes several hours.
The role of kidneys is to filter waste from blood.
At a high-level, the clearing problem for barter exchanges is similar to the clearing problem (aka winner  determination problem) in combinatorial auctions.
We can encode a barter exchange market as a directed graph G = (V, E) in the following way.
Barter exchanges are ubiquitous: examples include Peerflix (DVDs) [11], Read It Swap It (books) [12], and Intervac (holiday houses) [9].
1.2 Paper Outline The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The key then is incremental problem formulation.
• First, any loss of optimality could lead to unnecessary patient deaths.
Allowing length-3 cycles leads to additional significant gains.
Section 7 discusses recent  fielding of our algorithm.
We adapt two  paradigms for the task: constraint generation and column  generation.
Straight-forward ILP encodings are too large to even construct on current hardware - not to talk about solving them.
Section 6 presents experiments on the various techniques.
Since 1999, significant work has been done in computer science and operations research on faster optimal tree search algorithms for clearing combinatorial auctions.
Exchange M1 has both maximum weight and maximum cardinality (i.e., it includes the most edges/vertices).
1.1 Prior Work Several recent papers have used simulations and  marketclearing algorithms to explore the impact of a national  kidney exchange [13, 20, 6, 14, 15, 17].
(One cannot write a binding contract to donate an organ.)
In 2005, there were 6,563 live donations in the US.
