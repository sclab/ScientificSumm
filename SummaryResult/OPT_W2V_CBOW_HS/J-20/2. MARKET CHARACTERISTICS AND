Finally, although our  algorithms can handle more general weight functions, patients have a utility of 1 for compatible donors, since their survival probability is not affected by the choice of donor [3].
Note that there can be a large amount of variability in the  markets - in one 5000 patient market, less than 1000 patients were in the maximum-cardinality exchange.
For each market size, the bounds were computed over 10 randomly generated markets.

Each patient is assigned a potential donor with a random blood type and relation to the patient.
Note that a market with 5000 patients can already have more than 450 million cycles of length 2 and 3.
INSTANCE GENERATOR We test the algorithms on simulated kidney exchange  markets, which are generated by a process described in Saidman et al.
Briefly, the process involves generating patients with a random blood type, sex, and probability of being tissue-type incompatible with a randomly chosen donor.
If the patient and potential donor are incompatible, the two are entered into the  market.
This process is based on the extensive nationwide data maintained by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) [21], so it generates a realistic instance  distribution.
The lower bounds were found by clearing the market with length-2 cycles only, while the upper bounds had no  restriction on cycle length.
Several papers have used variations of this process to demonstrate the effectiveness of a national kidney exchange (extrapolating from small instances or restricting the  clearing to 2-cycles) [6, 20, 14, 13, 15, 17].

Table 2 gives additional characteristics of the kidney-exchange market.
One complication, handled by the generator, is that if the  patient is female, and she has had a child with her potential donor, then the probability that the two are incompatible increases.
(This is because the mother develops antibodies to her partner during pregnancy.)
Blood type and tissue type information is then used to decide on which patients and donors are compatible.
This means that the maximum-weight exchange has maximum cardinality.
Table 1 gives lower and upper bounds on the size of a maximum-cardinality exchange in the kidney-exchange  market.
These  probabilities are based on actual real-world population data.
