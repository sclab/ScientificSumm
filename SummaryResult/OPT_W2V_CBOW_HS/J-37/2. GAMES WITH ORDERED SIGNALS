, γr are vectors of nonnegative integers, where κj and γj denote the  number of public and private signals (per player),  respectively, revealed in round j.
Let Sj ⊆ j k=1 Θκk × j k=1 Θγk be the set of legal signals (i.e., no repeated signals) for one player through round j.
A behavior strategy for player i in round j of Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u with information filter F is a probability distribution over possible actions, and is defined for each player i, each round j, and each v ∈ V j \Zj for Lj (v) = i: σj i,v : j−1 k=1 ωk cont×Range  Fj  → Δ n w ∈ V j | (v, w) ∈ Ej o .
, n} is a finite set of players.
We are left with the original game if we use the identity filter Fj  ˜αj , ˜βj i  = n ˜αj , ˜βj i o .
By an abuse of notation, we will say player i receives an expected payoff of ui(σ) when all players are playing the strategy profile σ.
We also assume that the legal actions that a player has are independent of the signals received.
For any filtered ordered game, a Nash  equilibrium exists in behavior strateges.
A behavior strategy for player i in round j is σj i = (σj i,v1 , .
The private information  revealed to player i ∈ I in round j is βj i ∈ Θγj and the private information revaled to player i ∈ I in all rounds up through round j is ˜βj i = ` β1 i , .
8. ω : rS j=1 Zj → {over, continue} is a mapping of  terminal nodes within a stage game to one of two  values: over, in which case the game ends, or continue, in which case the game continues to the next round.
A game with ordered signals is a tuple Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u where: 1.
, ur ), uj : j−1 k=1 ωk cont × ωj over × j k=1 Θκk × n i=1 j k=1 Θγk → Rn is a utility function such that for every j, 1 ≤ j ≤ r, for every i ∈ I, and for every ˜z ∈ j−1 k=1 ωk cont × ωj over, at least one of the following two conditions holds: (a) Utility is signal independent: uj i (˜z, ϑ) = uj i (˜z, ϑ ) for all legal ϑ, ϑ ∈ j k=1 Θκk × n i=1 j k=1 Θγk .
(b) is defined for all legal signals (˜αj , ˜βj i ), (˜αj , ˜β j i ) through round j and a player"s utility is increasing in her private signals, everything else equal:  ˜αj , ˜βj i   ˜αj , ˜β j i  =⇒ ui  ˜z, ˜αj ,  ˜βj i , ˜βj −i  ≥ ui  ˜z, ˜αj ,  ˜β j i , ˜βj −i  .
Strategy σi is said to be player i"s best response to σ−i if for all other strategies σi for player i we have ui(σi, σ−i) ≥ ui(σi, σ−i).
We require that for all legal (θ1, .
Signals are drawn from Θ according to p without replacement, so if X is the set of signals already revealed, then p(x | X) = ( p(x)P y /∈X p(y) if x /∈ X 0 if x ∈ X.
Let ωj over = {z ∈ Zj | ω(z) = over} and ωj cont = {z ∈ Zj | ω(z) = continue}.
A game with ordered signals Γ and an information filter F for Γ defines a new game ΓF .
Each signal θ ∈ Θ may only be revealed once, and in each round every player receives the same number of private signals, so we  require Pr j=1 κj + nγj ≤ |Θ|.
A behavior strategy for player i in Γ is σi = ` σ1 i , .
2.2 Strategies and Nash equilibrium We are now ready to define behavior strategies in the  context of filtered ordered games.
Instead of completely revealing a signal (either public or private) to a player, the signal first passes through this filter, which outputs a coarsened signal to the player.
Let Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u be an ordered game.
, ˜βj n  to represent all private information up through round j, and  ˜β j i , ˜βj −i  =  ˜βj 1, .
, Gr , Gj = ` V j , Ej ´ , is a finite collection of finite directed trees with nodes V j and edges Ej .
, θmj ) ⊆ Θ and (θ1, .
(Information preservation) If two values of a signal are distinguishable in round k, then they are  distinguishable fpr each round j > k. Let mj = Pj l=1 κl +γl .
A game with ordered signals consists of a finite number of rounds.
In each round, there can be public signals (announced to all players) and private signals (confidentially communicated to individual players).
σ is a Nash equilibrium if, for every player i, σi is a best response for σ−i.
, σj i,vm ) for each vk ∈ V j \ Zj where Lj (vk) = i.
A filtered ordered game is an extensive form game satisfying perfect recall.
(Truthfulness) (˜αj , ˜βj i ) ∈ Fj (˜αj , ˜βj i ) for all legal (˜αj , ˜βj i ).
, Lr , Lj : V j \ Zj → I indicates which player acts (chooses an outgoing edge) at each internal node in round j.
, σr i ´ .
6. p is a probability distribution over Θ, with p(θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ Θ.
Θ is a finite set of signals.
Finally, the strongest assumption is that there is a partial ordering over sets of signals, and the payoffs are increasing (not  necessarily strictly) in these signals.
The total information revealed up through round j,  ˜αj , ˜βj  , is said to be legal if no signals are repeated.
, ˜βj n  is ˜βj with ˜βj i replaced with ˜β j i .
Note that ω is independent of the signals.
, θmj ) ⊆ Θ: (θ1, .
Let Zj denote the leaf nodes of Gj and let Nj (v) denote the outgoing neighbors of v ∈ V j .
Within a round, the players play a game on a directed tree (the tree can be different in different rounds).
A simple proof proceeds by constructing an extensive form game directly from the ordered game, and showing that it satisfies perfect recall.
The public information revealed in round j is αj ∈ Θκj and the public  information revealed in all rounds up through round j is ˜αj = ` α1 , .
For simplicity, we assume-as is the case in most recreational games-that within each round, the number of private signals received is the same across players (this could quite likely be relaxed).
A strategy profile with σi replaced by σi is (σi, σ−i) = (σ1, .
Gj is the stage game for round j.
A strategy profile is σ = (σ1, .
In determining the payoffs in a game with filtered signals, we take the average over all real signals in the filtered class, weighted by the probability of each real signal occurring.
A Nash equilibrium always exists in finite extensive form games [36], and one exists in behavior strategies for games with perfect recall [29].
7. is a partial ordering of subsets of Θ and is defined for at least those pairs required by u.
, ˜βj i−1, ˜β j i , ˜βj i+1, .
, Fr where each Fj is a function Fj : Sj → 2Sj such that each of the following conditions hold: 1.
The only uncertainty players face stems from private signals the other players have received and from the unknown future signals.
I = {1, .
2.1 Information filters In this subsection, we define an information filter for  ordered games.
(Δ(X) is the set of probability distributions over a finite set X.)
We 162 also write ˜βj =  ˜βj 1, .
By varying the filter applied to a game, we are able to obtain a wide variety of games while keeping the underlying action space of the game intact.
We will use the term game with ordered signals and the term ordered game interchangeably.
, θmk ) /∈ Fk (θ1, .
We refer to such games as filtered ordered games.
In other words, players observe each others" actions, but potentially not nature"s actions.
, θmj ) /∈ Fj (θ1, .
, βj i ´ .
An information filter for Γ is a collection F = F1 , .
This class, which we call games with ordered signals, is highly  structured, but still general enough to capture a wide range of strategic situations.
(Independence) The range of Fj is a partition of Sj .
, σi−1, σi, σi+1, .
For example, in poker, the legal  betting actions are independent of the cards received.
, θmk ) =⇒ (θ1, .
G = G1 , .
Definition 1.
Formally, an information filter is as follows.
, αj ´ .
For example, in poker, this partial ordering corresponds exactly to the ranking of card hands.
Using these observations, we have the following corollary to Proposition 1: 163 Corollary 1.
Clearly, we require ω(z) = over for all z ∈ Zr .
We work with a slightly restricted class of games, as  compared to the full generality of the extensive form.
, κr and γ = γ1 , .
We have the following simple (but important) result: Proposition 1.

We will use this when designing our abstraction techniques.
