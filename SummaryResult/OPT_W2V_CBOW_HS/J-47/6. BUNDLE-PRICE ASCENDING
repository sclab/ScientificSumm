AUCTIONS All the ascending auctions in the literature that are proved to find the optimal allocation for unrestricted valuations are non-anonymous bundle-price auctions (iBundle(3) by Parkes and Ungar [37] and the Proxy Auction by Ausubel and Milgrom [3]).
If every bidder demands a single  bundle in each step of the auction, conservative auctions may run for an exponential number of steps even for additive  valuations.
Nevertheless, we show that NBEA auctions (and in particular, iBundle(3) and the proxy auction) are sometimes inferior to simple item-price demand auctions.
a price of a bundle that should be demanded by the other bidder in the future.
An ascending auction is called conservative if it is  nonanonymous, uses bundle prices initialized to zero and at  every stage the auctioneer can only raise prices of bundles demanded by the bidders until this stage.
Auctions from this scheme end up with the optimal allocation for any class of valuations.
that bidder 1 demands cd before bidder 2 demands bd (no information will be elicited if none of these happens).
We denote this family of ascending auctions as NBEA  auctions29 .
For finding the optimal allocation we must know which value is greater between α and β.27 However, we  cannot learn the value of both α and β by a single ascending trajectory: assume w.l.o.g.
We conclude that anonymous  bundleprice auctions cannot guarantee a welfare greater than 2 for this class, where the optimal welfare can be arbitrarily close to n + 1.
An adversary may choose the values such that the low values of all the bidders for the bundles not in bidder 1"s partition are zero (i.e., vi(S1 j ) = 0 for every i = 1 and every j), however, allocating each bidder a different bundle from bidder 1"s partition, might achieve a welfare of n+1−(n−1)δ (bidder 1"s valuation is 2, and 1 − δ for all other bidders); If these bundles were wrongly allocated, only a welfare of 2 might be achieved (2 for bidder 1"s high-valued bundle, 0 for all other bidders).
We construct n2 distinct  bundles with the following properties: for each bidder, we define a partition Si = (Si 1, ..., Si n) of the n2 items to n bundles, such that any two bundles from different partitions intersect.
2 v2(ab) = 2 v2(cd) = 2 v2(bd) = β ∈ (0, 1) Figure 7: Anonymous ascending bundle-price auctions cannot determine the optimal allocation for this class of valuations.
25 Substitute valuations are defined, e.g., in [16].
The basic idea: for  determining some unknown value of one bidder we must raise 24 Note that an anonymous ascending auction cannot  necessarily elicit a class that can be fully elicited by an ascending auction.
We also observe that in conservative auctions, allowing the bidders to submit all the bundles in their  demand sets ensures that the auction runs a polynomial  number of steps - if L is not too high (but with exponential communication, of course).
In addition, each bidder can only receive bundles he demanded during the auction.
6.1 Limitations of Anonymous Bundle-Price Ascending Auctions We present a class of valuations that cannot be elicited by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions.
Item Prices The core of the auctions in [37, 3] is the scheme described in Figure 8 (in the spirit of [35]) for auctions with  nonanonymous bundle prices.
Thus, bidder 2 will never demand the bundle bd, and no  information will be elicited about β.
An anonymous bundle-price ascending  auction cannot guarantee better than a min{ n 2 , √ m 2 }  approximation for the optimal welfare.
Note that NBEA auctions are by definition  conservative.
family may use an exponential number of queries even for determining the optimal allocation among two bidders with additive valuations30 , where such valuations can be elicited by a simple item-price ascending auction.
If the bidders are allowed to submit all the bundles in their demand sets in each step, then conservative auctions can run in a polynomial number of steps for any profile of valuations, as long as the maximal valuation L is polynomial in m, n and 1 δ .
Every bidder has an atomic bid, in his XOR valuation, for each of these n2 bundles.
Yet, several anonymous ascending auctions have been suggested (e.g., AkBA [42], [21] and iBundle(2) [37]).
On the other hand, the valuations in Figure 6 can be easily elicited by an anonymous bundle-price ascending auction.
We conclude that the power of these two families of ascending auctions is incomparable.
This approximation ratio can be achieved with polynomial communication, and specifically with a  polynomial number of item-price demand queries.28 Theorem 6.2.
27 If α > β, the optimal allocation will allocate cd to bidder 1 and ab to bidder 2.
Using these n2 bundles we construct a hard-to-elicit class.
NBEA auctions can elicit k-term XOR valuations by a polynomial (in k) number of steps , although the elicitation of such valuations may require an exponential number of item-price queries ([7]), and item-price ascending auctions cannot do it at all (Theorem 5.4).
Therefore, for eliciting any information about the low-valued bundles, the  auctioneer should first arbitrarily choose a bidder (w.l.o.g bidder 1) and raise the prices of all the bundles (S1 1 , ..., S1 n) to be greater than 1.
- The prices of bundles that were demanded by losing bidders are increased by .
Some classes of valuations cannot be  elicited by anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions.
Figure 8: Auctions from this family (denoted by NBEA auctions) are known to achieve the optimal welfare.
We strengthen the impossibility result above by showing that anonymous bundle-price auctions cannot even achieve better than a min{O(n), O( √ m)}-approximation for the  social welfare.
In this case, the price for bd must be greater than 1 (otherwise, bidder 1 prefers bd to cd).
Since the prices cannot decrease, the other bidders will clearly never demand these bundles in future stages.
We also show that the family of non-anonymous  bundleprice ascending auctions can run exponentially slower than simple item-price ascending auctions.
For completeness, we present in the full paper [9] a proof for the efficiency of such auctions for substitutes valuations.
Note that both bidders cannot gain a value of 2 in the same allocation, due to the intersections of the high-valued bundles.
We show that auctions from this 29 Non-anonymous Bundle-price economically Efficient Ascending auctions.
Consider a pair of XOR valuations as described in Figure 7.
This may justify the use of hybrid  auctions that use both linear and non-linear prices (e.g., the clock-proxy auction [10]).
At this point, the auctioneer cannot have any information about the identity of the bundles with the non-zero values.
The valuations described in the proof of Theorem 6.1 can be easily elicited by a non-anonymous item-price ascending auction.
We actually prove this property for a wider class of auctions we call  conservative auctions.
These  valuations are described in Figure 7.
Roughly speaking, a bidder with a substitute valuation will continue demand a certain item after the price of some other items was increased.
In this section, we prove that anonymous bundle-price ascending auctions achieve poor results in the worst-case.
No bidder will demand a low-valued bundle, as long as the price of one of his high-valued bundles is below 1 (and thus gain him a utility greater than 1).
41 Non-anonymous Bundle-Price Economically-Efficient Ascending Auctions: Initialization: All prices are initialized to zero (non-anonymous bundle prices).
1 v1(ac) = 2 v1(bd) = 2 v1(cd) = α ∈ (0, 1) Bid.
6.2 Bundle Prices vs.
26 A unit-demand valuation is an XOR valuation in which all the atomic bundles are singletons.
Therefore, an adversary can choose the values of the bundles received by bidders 2, ..., n in the final allocation to be zero.
For completeness, we give in the full paper [9] a simple proof for the efficiency (up to an ) of auctions of this scheme .
28 Note that bundle-price queries may use exponential  communication, thus the lower bound of [32] does not hold.
OXS valuations can be interpreted as an aggregation (OR) of any number of unit-demand bidders.
Finally: Terminate when the provisional allocation assigns to each bidder the bundle he demanded.
The rest of the proof is independent of the specific construction.
For all bundles in the other partitions, he has a value of either 0 or of 1 − δ, and these values are unknown to the auctioneer.
Since every pair of bundles from different partitions intersect, only one bidder can receive a bundle with a value of 2.
(Sketch) Assume we have n bidders and n2 items for sale, and that n is prime.
- The auctioneer calculates a provisional allocation that maximizes his revenue under the current prices.
Repeat: - Each bidder submits a bundle that maximizes his utility under his current personalized prices.
In the full paper, part II [9] we show an explicit construction using the properties of linear functions over finite fields.
A bidder i has a value of 2 for any bundle Si j in his partition.
Otherwise, we give bd to bidder 2 and ac to bidder 1.
