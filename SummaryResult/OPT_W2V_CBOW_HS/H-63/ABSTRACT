Access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme.
Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.1 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval - content analysis and indexing; H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and Retrieval - information search and retrieval.
None of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data (LDD) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination.
Push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast.
We argue that this scheme, when applied to LDD, significantly improves performance in terms of tuning time over the above mentioned schemes.
In this paper, we discuss the broadcast of LDD in our project DAta in Your Space (DAYS), and propose a scheme for indexing LDD.
Many dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push data to wireless channels for general consumption.
Two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes.
Push based broadcast [1] is essentially asymmetric, i.e., the volume of data being higher from the server to the users than from the users back to the server.
Data dissemination through wireless channels for broadcasting information to consumers is becoming quite common.
We prove our argument with the help of simulation results.
