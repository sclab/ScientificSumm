Experiments show: (a) An effective tuning of the networks as time passes and more queries are posed to the network, even if agents maintain the models of a small percentage of their acquaintances.
As it is shown in Figure 4, as agents search and share information from run 1 to run 40, they manage to increase the benefit of the system, by drastically reducing the number of messages.
The comparison to the case where no routing indices are exploited reveals the same results as in the static case, to the cost of a large number of messages.
Results computed in each experiment show the number of  querypropagation messages ( ), the number of messages for the update of indices ( ), the of the system, i.e.
In such a setting, the demand for information items is much higher than the agents" information provision abilities, given the of queries: The maximum benefit in any experimental case is much less than 60% (this has been done so as to challenge the ‘tuning" task in settings where queries can not be served in the first hop or after 2-3 hops).
These are results from a particular representative case of our experiments where more than 25% of (randomly chosen) nodes leave the network in each run during the experiment.
The exact number of acquaintances is randomly chosen per agent and queries are being propagated only to those acquaintances that are likely to best i-messages per run q-messages per run benefit per run message gain per run 252 The Sixth Intl.
have lower benefit): This is due to the fact that, as agents posses information about acquaintances" local repositories, the tuning process enables the further exchange of messages concerning agents" information provision abilities in cases where agents" profiles provide evidence for such a need.
Figures 4 and 5 show experiments for static and dynamic networks of TypeA-10 (dense network with a low percentage of acquaintances), TypeB-20 (quite dense network with a low percentage of acquaintances), with initialization and without initialization, and TypeC-50 (not a so dense network with a quite high percentage of acquaintances).
decrease the number of required messages) to the cost of loosing effectiveness (i.e.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 251 we have run several experiments with various types of networks.
Table1: Network types |N| R N avg(|N(A)|) |T| TypeA 100 10 25 50 363 TypeB 500 10 125 20 1690 TypeC 1000 10 250 10 3330 Information used in the experiments is synthetic and is being classified in 15 distinct categories: Each agent"s expertise comprises a unique information category.
Given that agents are initially not aware of acquaintances" local repository (  case), we have run several evaluation experiments for each network type depending on the percentage of acquaintances to which a query can be propagated by an agent.
To demonstrate the advantages of our method we have considered networks without 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 0 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 0.003 0.0035 TypeB-20 TypeB-20 without RIs TypeC-50 TypeC-50 without RIs TypeC-50 (static) Figure 5.
Considering also the information sharing method without routing indices ( cases), we can see that for static networks it requires more without managing to tune the system, while the benefit is nearly the same to the one reported by our method.
Each run lasts a number of rounds that depends on the of queries and on the parameters that determine the dynamics of the network: To end a run, all queries must have either been served (i.e.
Finally it must be pointed that the maximum number of messages per query required by the proposed method is nearly 12, which is less than that that reported by other efforts. 
The column avg(|N(A)|) shows the average number of acquaintances per agent in the network and the column |T| shows the number of queries per network type.
(b) That ‘tuning" can greatly facilitate the scalability of the information searching and sharing tasks in networks.
Results for dynamic networks as agents gather information about acquaintances" abilities and interests routing indices for TypeC-50 and TypeB-20 networks: Agents in these networks, similarly to [12,13], share information concerning their local repository based on their assessments on acquaintances" interests.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 253 rounds, a new node may replace the one left.
To show whether initial knowledge about acquaintances local repository (the   case) affects the effective tuning of the network, we provide representative results from the TypeB-20 network.
This is further shown in a more clear way in the message gain of both approaches: The message gain of the TypeB-20 with   case is higher than the message gain for the TypeB-20 experiment with  .
Networks are constructed by distributing randomly | | agents in an area, each with a visibility ratio equal to The acquaintances of an agent are those that are visible to the agent and those from which the agent is visible (since edges in the network are  bidirectional).
On the contrary, while the tuning affects the drastically; the are not affected in the same way: The in the  case are less than those in the TypeB-20 with   case.
the average ratio of information pieces provided to the number of pieces requested per query, and the i.e.
Here we present results from 3 network types with | |=100, | |=500 and | |=1000 that provide representative cases.
Figure 5 shows that the message gain for the dynamic case is comparable to the message gain for the corresponding  (TypeC50) static case, which proves the value of this approach for dynamic settings.
Therefore, initial knowledge concerning local information of acquaintances can be used for guiding searching and tuning at the initial stages of the tuning task, only if we need to gain efficiency (i.e.
For the category in its expertise each agent holds at most 1000 information pieces, the exact number of which is determined randomly.
Also (not shown here due to space reasons) the number of unfulfilled queries decrease, while the served queries increase gradually.
the ratio of benefit to the total number of messages.
At each run a constant number of queries are being generated, depending on the type of network used (last column in Table 1).
In such a highly dynamic setting with very scarce information resources distributed in the network, as Figure 5 shows, the tuning approach has managed to keep the benefit to acceptable levels, while still reducing drastically the number of i-messages.
This is the case when some queries are the only active remained and the agents to whom they have been propagated left the network without their acquaintances to be aware of it.
Approximately 25% of the nodes that leave the network are not replaced for 50% of the experiment, and approximately 50% are not replaced for more than 35% of the experiment.
At each run, each query is randomly assigned to an originator agent and is set to request a random number of information items, classified in a sub-category of the query-originator agent"s expertise.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) serve the request.
The for any query is set to be equal to 6.
As it is shown in Figure 4, the tuning task in this case does not manage to achieve the benefit of the system reported for the   case.
In each run the network is provided with a new set of randomly generated queries that are originated from randomly chosen agents.
However, as it can be expected, this reduction is not so drastic as it was in the corresponding static cases.
Results for static networks as agents gather information about acquaintances" abilities and interests network of TypeA where each query is being propagated to at most 10% of an agent"s acquaintances.
After a random number of i-messages per run q-messages per run benefit per run message gain per run The Sixth Intl.
This sub-category is chosen in a random way and the requested items are less than 6000.
In case we need to gain effectiveness to the cost of reducing efficiency, this type of local knowledge does not suffice.
The agents search and gather knowledge that they further use and enrich, tuning the network gradually, run by run.
For instance, TypeA-10 denotes a setting with a 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 TypeA-10 Type B-20 (no initialization) TypeB-20 (initialization) Type C-50 4000 14000 24000 34000 44000 54000 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 0 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 0.003 0.0035 0.004 0.0045 TypeA-10 TypeB-20 (no initialization) Type B-20 (initialization) TypeC-50 TypeB-20 without RIs Figure 4.
These types of experiments are denoted by TypeX-Y, where X denotes the type of network and Y the percentage of acquaintances: Here we present results for Y equal to 10, 20 or 50.
100% of the information items requested must have been found), or they must have been unfulfilled (i.e.
However, initial information about acquaintances" local repositories may mislead the searching process, resulting in low benefit.
It must be noticed that in case of a dynamic setting, this ending criterion causes some of the queries to be lost.
Details about networks are given in Table 1.
This newcomer has no information about the network.
It must be noticed that the TypeA network is more dense than the others, which are much larger than this.
To validate the proposed approach we have built a prototype that simulates large networks.
To test the scalability of our approach The Sixth Intl.
This is shown clearly in the message gain diagrams in Figure 4.
