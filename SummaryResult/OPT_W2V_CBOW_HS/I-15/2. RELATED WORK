This approach is based on the specification of agents as providers and needers: This is done by a plan-based  precomputation of information needs and provision abilities of agents.
Exploiting the models of other agents in the network, agents construct their view of the network which is being used for forming routing decisions.
Their work differs in the one reported here in the following aspects: First, it aims at optimizing communication, while the goal here is to tune the network for effective information sharing, reducing communication and increasing system"s benefit.
In accordance to this approach, in [12,13,14], information sharing is considered only for static networks and self-tuning of networks is not demonstrated.
The gradual creation of overlay networks via re-wiring, shortcuts creation [1,8,16] or clustering of peers [17,9] are tuning approaches that differ fundamentally from the one proposed here: Through local interactions, we aim at tuning the network for efficient information provision by gathering routing information gradually, as queries are being propagated in the network and 1 General research in peer-to-peer systems concentrates either on network topologies or on distribution of documents: Approaches do not aim to optimize advertising, and search mostly requires common keys for nodes and their contents.
Furthermore, the probabilities of transitions can be dependent too; something that increases the complexity of the problem: For example, when an agent sends a query to another agent, then this may affect the state of the latter, as far as the assessed interests of the former are concerned.
However, in a large-scale dynamic system with decentralized control it is very hard for agents to possess accurate partial views of the environment, and it is even more hard for agents to possess a global view of the environment.
Considering research in semantic peer-to-peer systems1 , most of the approaches exploit what can be loosely stated a routing index.
REMINDIN" [10] peers gather information concerning the queries that have been answered successfully by other peers, so as to subsequently select peers to forward requests to: This is a lazy learning approach that does not involve advertisement of peer information provision abilities.
The proposed method requires a high volume of computations that authors aim to reduce by restricting its application to static logical teams of associated agents.
However, this approach can not scale to large and dynamic networks, as it would be highly inefficient for each agent to compute and determine its potential needs and information provision abilities given its potential interaction with 100s of other agents.
Although this work aims at tuning a network for efficient information provision (through  reorganization), it does not demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with respect to this issue.
In [5,6] peers, using a common ontology, advertise their expertise, which is being exploited for the formation of a semantic overlay network: Queries are propagated in this network depending on their similarity with peers" expertise.
Token based approaches are promising for scaling coordination and therefore information provision and sharing to large-scale systems effectively.
Furthermore, agents" observations can not be assumed independent, as one agent"s actions can affect the observations of others: For instance, when one agent joins/leaves the system, then this may affect other agents" assessment of neighbours" information provision abilities.
Considering independent activities and observations, authors in [4] propose a decision-theoretic solution treating standard action and information exchange as explicit choices that the decision maker must make.
As it will be shown in section 5, our experiments show that although these approaches can handle information sharing in dynamic networks, they require a larger amount of messages in comparison to the approach proposed here and can not tune the network for efficient information sharing.
A major question concerning information searching is what information has to be shared between peers, when, and what adjustments have to be made so as queries to be routed to trustworthy information sources in the most effective and efficient way.
Proactive communication has been proposed in [17] as a result of a dynamic decision theoretic determination of communication strategies.
Information provision and sharing can be considered to be a decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process [3,4,11,14].
In [11] authors provide a mathematical framework for routing tokens, providing also an approximation to solving the original problem in case of independent agents" activities.
The computation of an optimal control policy is simple given that global states can be factored, that the probability of transitions and observations are independent, the observations combined determine the global state of the system and the reward function can be easily defined as the sum of local reward functions [3].
Dealing with static networks, they focus on minimizing processing and communication bottlenecks: Although we deal with concurrent search sessions, their work is orthogonal to ours, which may be further extended towards incorporating such features in the future.
Here, agents actively advertise their information provision abilities based on the assessed interests of their peers: This results in a much lower number of messages per query than those reported in REMINDIN".
Initially, agents build their views using the models of their neighbours.
Clusters are being exploited during information retrieval using a kNN approach and a gradient search scheme.
Moreover, although during  reorganization and retrieval they measure the similarity of content between agents, a more fine grained approach is needed that would allow agents to measure similarities of information items or sub-collections of information items.
Given the success of this method, we shall study how the addition of logical paths and gradual evolution of the network topology can further increase the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
In the general case, decentralized control of  largescale dynamic systems of cooperative agents is a hard problem.
According to our approach, agents advertise selectively their information provision abilities about specific topics to their neighbours with similar information interests (and only to these).
Viewing information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems from a multi-agent system perspective, the approach proposed in [18] is based on a language model of agents" documents collection.
However, this is done as time passes and while agents" receive requests from their peers.
Based on their work on peer-to-peer systems, H.Zhand and V.Lesser in [19] study concurrent search sessions.
It is on the receiver"s side to decide whether it shall accept or not an advertisement, based on the similarity between expertise descriptions.
They generate a substantial overhead in highly dynamic settings, where nodes join/leave the system.
Last, in contrast to their approach where agents broadcast messages, here agents decide not only when to communicate, but to whom to send a message too.
Third, they consider that transitions and observations made by agents are independent, which, as already discussed, is not true in the general case.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agents advertise their information provision abilities given the interests of their neighbours.
Second, the solution is approximated using a myopic algorithm, but authors do not demonstrate how  suboptimal are the solutions computed (something we neither do), given their interest to the optimal solution.
Then, the system reorganizes by forming clusters of agents with similar content.
This results in a tuning process where the overall recall increases over time, while the number of messages per query remains about the same.

However, it is expected that this will complicate re-organization.
Optimal solutions can only be approximated by means of heuristics, by relaxations of the original problem or by centralized solutions.
They approximate the solution using a myopic algorithm.
