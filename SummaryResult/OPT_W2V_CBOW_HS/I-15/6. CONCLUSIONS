Specifically, the paper demonstrates through extensive performance experiments: (a) How networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" so as to provide requested information effectively, increasing the benefit and the efficiency of the system.
The presented method enables agents to keep records of acquaintances" interests, to advertise their information provision abilities to those that have a high interest on them, and to maintain indices for routing queries to those agents that have the requested information provision abilities.
This paper presents a method for semantic query processing in large networks of agents that combines routing indices with information sharing methods.
(b) How different types of local knowledge (number, local information repositories, percentage, interests and information provision abilities of acquaintances) can guide agents to effectively answer queries, balancing between efficiency and efficacy.
(d) That the information gathered and maintained by agents supports efficient and effective information searching and sharing: Initial information about acquaintances information provision abilities is not necessary and a small percentage of acquaintances suffices.
(c) That the proposed tuning task manages to increase the efficiency of information searching and sharing in highly dynamic and large networks.
Further work concerns experimenting with real data and ontologies, differences in ontologies between agents, shifts in expertise and the parallel construction of overlay structure.
