We presented the design of TSAR, a fundamentally different storage architecture that envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local storage at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
We  implemented TSAR in a two-tier sensor testbed comprising  Stargatebased proxies and Mote-based sensors.
Our experimental  evaluation of TSAR demonstrated the benefits and feasibility of  employing our energy-efficient low-latency distributed storage architecture in multi-tier sensor networks.
In this paper, we argued that existing sensor storage systems are designed primarily for flat hierarchies of homogeneous sensor nodes and do not fully exploit the multi-tier nature of emerging  sensor networks.
At the proxy tier, TSAR employs a novel multi-resolution ordered distributed index structure, the Sparse  Interval Skip Graph, for efficiently supporting spatio-temporal and range queries.
At the sensor tier, TSAR supports energy-aware adaptive summarization that can trade-off the energy cost of  transmitting metadata to the proxies against the overhead of false hits  resulting from querying a coarser resolution index structure.
