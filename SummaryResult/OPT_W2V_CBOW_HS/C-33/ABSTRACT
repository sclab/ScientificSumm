Most existing approaches use a centralized selection mechanism to decide which context information is appropriate.
How to provide appropriate context information is a  challenging problem in context-aware computing.
In order to support our approach, we have designed a concrete negotiation model with rewards.
Distributed context providers  negotiate with each other to decide who can provide context and how they allocate proceeds.
We also evaluate our approach and show that it indeed can choose an appropriate context provider and allocate the proceeds fairly.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards to solving such problem.
