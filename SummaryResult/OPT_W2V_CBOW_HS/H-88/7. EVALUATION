Figure 8 plots values of the inex-2003 MAP metric for two quantizations, with and without consideration of overlap.

Figure 7 plots the three variants of inex-2002 MAP metric together with the XCG metric.
Recalling that the XCG metric is designed to penalize overlap, while the inex-2002 metric ignores overlap, the conflict between the metrics is obvious.
The INEX evaluation packages (inex_eval and inex_eval_ng) were used to  compute values for the inex-2002 and inex-2003 metrics.
The MAP values at one extreme (α = 0.0) and the XCG value at the other extreme (α = 1.0) represent retrieval performance comparable to the best systems at INEX 2004 [8,12].
are plotted for values of α between 0.0 and 1.0.
None of the metrics described in section 3.3 is a close fit with the view of overlap advocated by this paper.
Values for the XCG metrics were computed using software supplied by its inventors [11].
Once again, conflict is apparent, with the influence of α substantially lessened when overlap is considered. 
Nonetheless, when taken together they provide insight into the  behaviour of the re-ranking algorithm.
