We have seen that the system is well behaved if the agents all follow a threshold strategy; we now want to show that there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium where they do so (that is, a Nash equilibrium where all the agents use Sk for some k > 0.)
All that Theorem 4.1 shows is that, among best responses, there is at least one that is a threshold strategy.
It follows that this tuple of threshold strategies is a Nash equilibrium.
Either k is unique (that is, there is a unique best response that is also a threshold strategy), or there exists an integer k such that Sγ is a best response for agent i for all γ in the interval [k , k +1] (and these are the only best responses among threshold strategies).
If n is sufficiently large, then the  strategy played by one agent will not affect the distribution of money significantly.
It follows easily from the proof Theorem 4.1 that if br(δ, γ) is the minimal best response threshold strategy if all the other agents are playing Sγ and the discount factor is δ then, for fixed δ, br(δ, ·) is a step function.
There exists δ∗ < 1 and n∗ such that if δ > δ∗ , n > n∗ , and every agent other than i is playing Sγ in game G(n, δ), then there is an integer k such that the best response for agent i is Sk .
Thus, the probability of i moving from one state (dollar amount) to another depends only on i"s strategy (since we can take the probability that i will be chosen to make a request and the probability that i will be chosen to satisfy a request to be constant).
It is not hard to show that for k∗ there exists a δ∗ such that for all δ ≥ δ∗ , br(δ, k∗ ) ≥ k∗ .
This argument also shows us that we cannot in general expect fixed points to be unique.
Since we know that there is a best response that is a threshold strategy, we can look for a Nash equilibrium in the space of threshold strategies.

We do this by first showing that, if every other agent is playing a threshold strategy, then there is a best response that is also a threshold strategy (although not  necessarily the same one).
This is the desired Nash equilibrium.
Clearly br(δ, SM ) ≤ M for all δ, so the best response function is at or below the equilibrium at M. If k ≤ M/n, every player will have at least k dollars and so will be unwilling to work and the best response is just 0.
For all M, there exists δ∗ < 1 and n∗ such that if δ > δ∗ and n > n∗ , there exists a Nash equilibrium in the game G(n, δ) where all agents play Sγ for some integer γ > 0.
If br(δ, k∗ ) = k∗ and br(δ, k + 1) > k + 1 then our argument shows there must be a second fixed point.
We then show that there must be some (mixed) threshold strategy for which this best response is the same strategy.
However, as long as δ is sufficiently close to 1, we can ignore what happens during the period that the system is not in steady state.3 We have thus far considered threshold strategies of the form Sk, where k is a natural number; this is a discrete set of strategies.
Intuitively, if future utility is sufficiently discounted, then all that matters is the present, and there is no point in volunteering to work.
As we have already observed, one such  equilibrium occurs at 0.
It follows by continuity that if δ ≥ δ∗ , there must be some γ such that br(δ, γ) = γ.
However, we show that for δ sufficiently large, there is another equilibrium in threshold strategies.
As a first step, we show that, for all k, if everyone other than agent i is playing Sk, then there is a threshold  strategy Sk that is a best response for agent i.
For a later proof, it will be helpful to have a continuous set of strategies.
With small δ, S0 is the only equilibrium.
We remark that there may be best responses that are not threshold strategies.
Theorem 4.2 allows us to restrict our design to agents using threshold strategies with the confidence that there will be a nontrivial equilibrium.
(Note that we are not considering arbitrary mixed threshold strategies here, but rather just mixing  between adjacent strategies for the sole purpose of making out strategies continuous in a natural way.)
In general there may be multiple fixed points even when br(δ, k∗ ) > k∗ , as illustrated in the Figure 4 with n = 1000 and M = 3000.
If δ is small, then agents have no incentive to work.
145 from the theorem that if there are two best responses, then a mixture of them is also a best response.
(Sketch:) If δ is sufficiently large, we can ignore what happens before the system converges to the  maximumentropy distribution.
Since no one can have more than $M, all strategies Sk for k > M are equivalent to SM ; these are just the strategies where the agent always volunteers in response to request made by someone who can pay.
It follows from standard results [23,  Theorem 6.11.6] that there is an optimal policy that is a  threshold policy.
It also follows 3 Formally, we need to define the strategies when the system is far from equilibrium.
If γ = k + γ , where k is a natural number and 0 ≤ γ < 1, let Sγ be the strategy that performs Sk with probability 1 − γ and Sk+1 with probability γ.
Fix a strategy Sγ and an agent i.
The argument that the best response is either unique or there is an interval of best responses follows from a more careful analysis of the value function for the MDP.
Theorem 3.1  applies to strategies Sγ (the same proof goes through without change), where γ is an arbitrary nonnegative real number.
This is not true in general.
However, these far from (stochastic) equilibrium strategies will not affect the equilibrium  behavior when n is large and deviations from stochastic  equilibrium are extremely rare.
It is easy to see that everywhere that this  bestresponse curve crosses the diagonal y = x defines a Nash equilibrium where all agents are using the same threshold strategy.
However, it does not rule out the possibility that there may be other equilibria that do not involve threshold stratgies.
If there are only $M in the system, we can restrict to threshold strategies Sk where k ≤ M + 1.
To prove this, we need to assume that the system is close to the  steadystate distribution (i.e., the maximum-entropy distribution).
Therefore, if we can join the steps by a vertical line, we get a best-response curve.
It is even possible (although it seems unlikely) that some of these equilibria might be better. 
Consider k∗ , the smallest k such that k > M/n.
Thus, from i"s point of view, the system is a Markov decision process (MDP), and i needs to compute the optimal policy  (strategy) for this MDP.
