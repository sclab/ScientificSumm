It should also work in  Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).
Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).
While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.
Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.
Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.
Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.
We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium  involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the  distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply  constraint).
Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual  providing it.
Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.
The  analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).
Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and  applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21]  provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each other"s questions.
This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].
This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user  maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated  fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.
In  systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.
It also leads to a solution for the problem of  dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.
Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.
However, these  attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.
A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.
Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.
Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these  techniques.
Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this  information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.
Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.
A number of attempts have been made at providing  general reputation systems (e.g.
Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).
In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.
On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to  respond to a request; they have enough money already.
For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some  filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.
Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and  benefit from the system without contributing to it.
However, they have a different set of problems.
However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be  terribly helpful.
In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.
These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the  continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.
These heavy users are some of the most  expensive customers ISPs have.
Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a  single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.
Having relatively few users provide most of the service  creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.
In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.
However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.
We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).
A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.
A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].
Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.
However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.
In Section 3, we  examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.
By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.
We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum  entropy.
However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.
For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the  number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.
Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.
Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip  systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].
Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.
The basic idea is to aggregate each user"s experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the system"s view of that individual"s reputation.
An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more  traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].
Thus Kazaa"s reputation system is ineffective.
This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.
Some universities have started charging students for  excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].
A related problem involves handling newcomers.
We conclude in Section 7.
