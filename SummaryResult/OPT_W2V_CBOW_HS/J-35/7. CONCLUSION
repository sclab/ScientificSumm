It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.
• We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system.
For example, we need to worry about the possibility of agents counterfeiting money or lying about whether service was actually provided.
For example, it is prohibitively expensive to ensure that bank  account balances can never go negative, a fact that our model does not capture.
Our  analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal).
• One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding.
There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system.
It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate.
In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model.
Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request.
This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks.
It would be  interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results.
We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.
Thus if this stability is  common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation.
What happens between these extremes?
While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money).
Like maintaining a presence in the network, this imposes a cost on the node, but unlike that, responsibility it can be easily shirked.
147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings.
• Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are  overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each other"s requests.
Another example is that Karma has nodes serve as bookkeepers for other nodes account balances.
It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders.
• We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many  altruists.
Karma suggests several ways to incentivize nodes to perform these duties.
Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance.
There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of  equilibria - are there usually 2?
There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior.
Karma [26] provdes techniques for dealing with both of these issues and a number of others, but some of Karma"s  implementation decisions point to problems for our model.
We have not investigated whether these mechanisms be incorporated without disturbing our equilibrium. 
We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy.
Thus, our  analysis provides a formal mechanisms for solving some important problems in implementing scrip systems.
Moreover, we can  compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency.
