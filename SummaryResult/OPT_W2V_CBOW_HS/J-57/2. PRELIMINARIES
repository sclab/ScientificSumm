A solution concept assigns to each  coalitional game a set of reasonable outcomes.
While this representation can represent all games that are superadditive, there are coalitional games that it cannot  represent.
This set of weights, (λS)S⊆N , is a balanced collection if for all i ∈ N, S⊆N λS(1S)i = 1 A game is balanced if for all balanced collections of weights, S⊆N λSv(S) ≤ v(N) (3) By the Bondereva-Shapley theorem, the core of a  coalitional game is non-empty if and only if the game is  balanced.
2.1 Technical Background We can represent a coalition game with transferable utility by the pair N, v , where • N is the set of agents; and • v : 2N → R is a function that maps each group of agents S ⊆ N to a real-valued payoff.
An outcome x ∈ Rn is in the core if ∀S ⊆ N x(S) ≥ v(S) (2) The core was one of the first proposed solution concepts for coalitional games, and had been studied in detail.
Additivity (ADD) For any two coalitional games v and w defined over the same set of agents N, φi(v + w) = φi(v) + φi(w) for all i ∈ N, where the game v + w is defined as (v + w)(S) = v(S) + w(S) for all S ⊆ N. We will refer to these axioms later in our proof of correctness of the algorithm for computing the Shapley value under our representation in section 4.
Unfortunately, this program has an exponential number of variables in the  number of players in the game, and hence an algorithm that  operates directly on this program would be infeasible in practice.
194 Dummy (DUM) If agent i is a dummy player, i.e., his marginal contribution to all groups S are the same, φi(v) = v({i}).
For computing the Shapley value, the authors showed that the complexity is linear in the input description; in particular, if the largest subgame (as measured by number of agents) is of size n and the number of subgames is m, then their algorithm runs in O(m2n ) time, where the input size will also be O(m2n ).
In this section, we will briefly review the basics of  coalitional game theory and its two primary solution concepts, the Shapley value and the core.1 We will also review  previous work on coalitional game representation in more detail.
More precisely, the semantics of the representation is that for a group of agents S, v(S) = max {T1,T2,...,Tn}∈Π i v(Ti) where Π is the set of all possible partitions of S. The value v(S) is only explicitly specified for S if v(S) is greater than all partitioning of S other than the trivial partition ({S}).
For a game to have a non-empty core, it must satisfy the property of balancedness, defined as follows.
On the other hand, there is an efficient algorithm for  computing the Shapley value of the game, and for determining whether the core is empty under the restriction of positive edge weights.
(v(S ∪ {i}) − v(S)) (1) The Shapley value is a solution concept that satisfies many nice properties, and has been studied extensively in the  economic and game theoretic literature.
Efficiency (EFF) A total of v(N) is distributed to the agents, i.e., i∈N φi(v) = v(N).
In a more recent paper, Conitzer and Sandholm described a representation that decomposes a coalitional game into a number of subgames whose sum add up to the original game [3].
Under this  representation, the authors showed that determining whether the core is non-empty is coNP-complete.
maximize λ∈R2n S⊆N λSv(S) subject to S⊆N λS1S = 1 ∀i ∈ N λS ≥ 0 ∀S ⊆ N (4) If the optimal value of (4) is greater than the value of the grand coalition, then the core is empty.
They described a concise  representation scheme that only states the value of a coalition if the value is strictly superadditive.
An outcome in a coalitional game specifies the utilities the agents receive.
However, in the unrestricted case,  determining whether the core is non-empty is coNP-complete.
An  example of a game that cannot be represented is the unit game, where v(S) = 1 as long as S = ∅.
Formally, let φi(v) denote the Shapley value of i under  characteristic function v, then2 φi(v) = S⊂N s!
Two of the best known solution concepts are the Shapley value and the core.
As there are exponentially many subsets, it will take space  exponential in the number of agents to describe a coalitional game.
Let 1S ∈ Rn denote the characteristic vector of S given by (1S)i = 1 if i ∈ S 0 otherwise Let (λS)S⊆N be a set of weights such that each λS is in the range between 0 and 1.
In fact, even determining the value of a group of agents is NP-complete.
For any given game, there may be multiple ways to decompose the game, and the decomposition may influence the computational complexity.
An important question for a given coalitional game is whether the core is empty.
It prescribes a fair way to divide the gains from cooperation when the grand coalition (i.e., N) is formed.
On the other hand, the problem of determining whether a certain outcome is in the core is coNP-complete. 
Symmetry (SYM) If agents i and j are interchangeable, then φi(v) = φj(v).
In their representation, the set of agents are the nodes of the graph, and the value of a set of agents S is the sum of the weights of the edges spanned by them.
Conitzer and Sandholm in [2] considered coalitional games that are superadditive.
For example, it will not be able to represent the majority game, where a group of agents S will have value of 1 if and only if s > n/2.
For example, it will not be able to represent any games with substitutability among the agents.
The division of payoff to agent i is the average marginal contribution of agent i over all possible permutations of the agents.
The payoffs in these subgames are then represented by their respective characteristic functions.
Therefore, we can use linear programming to  determine whether the core of a game is empty.
It is a descriptive solution concept that focuses on outcomes that are stable.
The core is another major solution concept for coalitional games.
This scheme is fully general as the characteristic form is a special case of this representation.
Stability under core means that no set of players can jointly deviate to improve their payoffs.
2 As a notational convenience, we will use the lower-case  letter to represent the cardinality of a set denoted by the  corresponding upper-case letter.
This representation is known as the characteristic form.
Notice that this representation is concise since the space required to specify such a game is O(n2 ).
2.2 Previous Work Revisited Deng and Papadimitriou looked into the complexity of various solution concepts on coalitional games played on weighted graphs in [4].
Throughout this paper, we will assume that the payoff to a group of agents can be freely distributed among its  members.
In other words, whether there is any outcome that is stable relative to group deviation.
The Shapley value is a normative solution concept.
However, this representation is not general; it will not be able to  represent interactions among three or more agents.
Different  solution concepts attempt to capture in some way outcomes that are stable and/or fair.
In section 5.4, we will describe an algorithm that answers the question of emptiness of core that works on the dual of this program instead.
This assumption is often known as the transferable utility assumption.
It has a very useful axiomatic characterization.
Formally, let x(S) denote i∈S xi.
