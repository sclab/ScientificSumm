We also develop efficient algorithms for two of the most important solution concepts, the Shapley value and the core, under this representation.
This representation scheme captures  characteristics of the interactions among the agents in a natural and concise manner.
We present a new approach to representing coalitional games based on rules that describe the marginal contributions of the agents.
The emptiness of the core can be determined in time  exponential only in the treewidth of a graphical interpretation of our representation.
The Shapley value can be computed in time linear in the size of the input.
