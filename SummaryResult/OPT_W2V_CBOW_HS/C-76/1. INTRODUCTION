After having motivated the need for such type of correlation we use two well-known IT service management models to gain  requirements for an appropriate workflow modeling and present our proposal for it (see Section 4).
As in this scenario the knowledge about services and their SLAs is used we call it service-oriented.
To handle the flood of events and to find the root cause of a fault, event correlation approaches like rule-based reasoning, case-based reasoning or the codebook approach have been developed.
Which services, and especially which customers, are affected by this fault?
In Section 2 we describe how event correlation is performed today and present a selection of the state-of-the-art event correlation techniques.
Until now, these approaches address primarily the correlation of events as reported from management tools or devices.
The definition of a service is therefore more general than the definition of a Web Service, but a Web Service is included in this service definition.
It can be addressed from two directions.
Section 3 describes the motivation for  serviceoriented event correlation and its benefits.
To avoid SLA violations it is especially important for service providers to identify the root cause of a fault in a very short time or even act proactively.
As a consequence, the results are applicable for Web Services as well as for other kinds of services.
An application of the approach for a web hosting scenario is performed in Section 6.
Top-down perspective: Several customers report a  problem in a certain time interval.
In this paper we define a service as a set of functions which are offered by a provider to a customer at a customer provider interface.
The main idea of correlation is to condense and structure events to retrieve meaningful  information.
In Section 5 we present our information modeling which is derived from the MNM Service Model.
As in today"s IT environments the offering of such services with an agreed service quality becomes more and more  important, this change also affects the event correlation.
The latter refers to the case of recognizing the influence of a device breakdown on the offered services.
How to identify a resource as being the problem"s root cause?
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
A service level  agreement (SLA) is defined as a contract between customer and provider about guaranteed service performance.
The last section concludes the paper and presents future work. 
Therefore, we call them device-oriented.
It has become a necessity for providers to offer such  guarantees for a differentiation from other providers.
In huge networks a single fault can cause a burst of failure events.
Are these trouble  reports correlated?
183 Bottom-up perspective: A device (e.g., router, server) breaks down.
