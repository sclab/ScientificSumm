In the seeding step, a query  sequence is split in portions called words of size W. These words are matched to database sequences and used as  alignment seeds if their scores are higher than a threshold T. In the extension step, alignments are generated from seeds.
To compare two sequences, we must find the best  alignment, which is to place one sequence above the other making clear the correspondence between similar characters [7].
2.1 The BLAST Algorithm BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Tool) [1] is a set of  programs used to search DNA and protein databases for  similarities between sequences.
Usually, one given biological sequence is compared against thousands or even millions of sequences that compose  genetic data banks.
Sensitivity is the rate at which the method fails to identify similar sequences whereas sensibility is the rate at which the method identifies sequences that are not similar [7].
BLAST provides programs to compare many combinations of query and database sequence types (table 1).
In this scenario, the use of exact methods such as SW is prohibitive.

A new parameter, S, is used to sort alignments.

Usually, these heuristic methods are  evaluated using the concepts of sensitivity and sensibility.
By now, there are millions of entries  composed of billions of nucleotides at GenBank, which is one of the most important public gene repositories.
Given an alignment between two sequences, a score is  usually associated for it as follows (figure 1).
BLAST [1] is the most widely used heuristic method for sequence comparison.
The score is the sum of all the values and the maximal score is the similarity between the sequences.
To compute exact local sequence alignments, [14]  proposed an algorithm (SW), based on dynamic programming, with quadratic time and space complexity.
The alignments are evaluated to determine if they are statistically significant.
For each column, we associate, for instance, +1 if the two characters are  identical, -1 if the characters are different and -2 if one of them is a space.
The combination of parameters W, T, X and S is used to determine the sensitivity and speed of BLAST searches. 
The significant ones are termed HSPs (High-scoring Segment Pairs).
A parameter X maintains the recent alignment history and controls this step.
It is designed to obtain high  performance with low impact in terms of sensibility.
For this reason, faster heuristic methods are proposed which do not guarantee that the best alignment will be produced.
Basically, the algorithm proceeds in three steps: seeding, extension and evaluation.
Once seeds are extended, the last step begins.
In 1996-1997, two gapped versions of BLAST emerged: NCBI-BLAST [3] and WU-BLAST [6].
