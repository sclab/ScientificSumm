In this paper, we considered an online scheduling domain for which algorithms with the best possible competitive  ratio had been found, but for which new solutions were  required when the setting is extended to include self-interested agents.
We then showed a matching lower bound on the  competitive ratio that can be achieved by a deterministic mechanism that never pays the agents.
We also showed how this mechanism could be simplified when k = 1 and each agent cannot lie about the length of its job.
Also, while we feel that it is reasonable to strengthen the  assumption of knowing the maximum possible ratio of value  densities (k) to knowing the actual range of possible value  densities, it would be interesting to determine whether there exists a ((1 + âˆš k)2 + 1)-competitive mechanism under the original assumption.
We presented a mechanism that is incentive  compatible with respect to release time, deadline, length and value, and that only increases the competitive ratio by one.
One is to determine whether the lower bound can be strengthened by removing the restriction of non-negative payments.
Several open problems remain in this setting.
Finally, randomized mechanisms  provide an unexplored area for future work.
