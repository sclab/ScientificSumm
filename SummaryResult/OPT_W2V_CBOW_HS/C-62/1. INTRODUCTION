In other words, unless new monitoring capabilities are introduced, and integrated with the system of contracts, the network cannot achieve optimal routing and innovation characteristics.
They propose a system of Anycast to give end-users the ability to tunnel their packets to an ISP that introduces a desirable protocol.
Unlike the first two strategies, we are not aware of any previous studies that have connected accountability with the pathologies of commoditization or lack of innovation.
Moreover, we derive exactly what monitors are needed to optimize routes and support innovation.
This requires a mechanism to motivate ISPs to share their monitor outputs with each other.
This payment is a function of the past and present behaviors of the participants, but only those that are verifiable.
Network Behavior Monitor Contract Proof Payments 184 To summarize, we argue that the Internet"s lack of accountability must be addressed before the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation can be resolved.
There is currently little theoretical foundation to compare the relative merits of each proposal, and a particular lack of evidence linking accountability with innovation and service differentiation.
In the extreme case, the cheater may force the other ISPs out of business, thereby gaining a monopoly on some routes.
Our model will demonstrate that identifying a cheating ISP is difficult under low accountability, limiting the threat of market driven punishment.
This result provides motivation for the remainder of the paper, in which we explore how accountability can be leveraged to overcome these pathologies and create a sustainable industry.
We will use our model for two main purposes: First, we will use our model to argue that the lack of accountability in today"s network is a fundamental obstacle to overcoming the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation.
We may adopt this as our null hypothesis: Null hypothesis: Market forces are sufficient to maintain service diversity and innovation on a network, at least to the same extent as they do in traditional markets.
The process continues through the network, giving every ISP a competitive reason to increase quality.
Clark, et al., suggest that giving end-users control over routing would lead to greater service diversity, recognizing that some payment mechanism must also be provided [5].
The last requirement is somewhat unconventional from an economic perspective, but we maintain that it is crucial for any reasonable solution.
The solution is surprisingly simple: contractible monitors must report the quality of the rest of the path, from each ISP to the destination.
An institution to support contracts is typically complex, but we abstract it as follows: We imagine that a contract is an algorithm that outputs a payment transfer among a set of ISPs (the parties) at every time.
Figure 1: Relationship between monitors and contracts With this model, we may conclude that the level of accountability in today"s Internet only permits best effort contracts.
We will call any process that generates these proofs a contractible monitor.
Access providers are themselves customers for second hop ISPs, and the second hops will therefore try to provide  highquality service in order to secure traffic from access providers.
In recent decades, numerous ideas have been developed in universities, implemented in code, and even written into the routers and end systems of the network, only to languish as network operators fail to turn them on on a large scale.
In section 5, we turn our attention to contractible monitors.
There is a popular intuitive argument that supports this hypothesis, and it may be summarized as follows: Intuitive argument supporting null hypothesis: 1.
This example shows that other types of monitors may be useful as building blocks, but must be combined to form rest of path monitors in order to achieve ideal innovation characteristics.
It is clear that these three strategies are closely linked to each other (for example, [2], [5], and [9] each argue that giving end-users routing control within the current contracting system is problematic).
It turns out that this is the correct minimum accountability requirement, as opposed to either end-to-end monitors or hop-by-hop monitors, as one might initially suspect.
The rest of path monitor then includes the component monitors and the distributed algorithmic mechanism that ensures that information is shared as required.
Instead of focusing on incremental improvements, we try to imagine how an ideal industry would behave, then derive the level of accountability needed to meet that objective.
Moreover, our model allows us to explore any theoretically possible punishments against cheaters, including those that are costly for end-users to administer.
The extra traffic to the ISP, the authors suggest, will motivate the initial investment.
In the long term, this pathology stands out as a critical obstacle to the network"s continued success (Ratnasamy, Shenker, and McCanne provide extensive discussion in [11]).
Lacking the incentives just to activate services, there seems to be little hope of ISPs devoting adequate resources to developing new ideas.
Applying this equilibrium concept, we derive the monitors needed to maintain innovation and optimize routes.
Our concept includes the following requirements: First, we require that punishing ISPs that cheat is done without rerouting the path.
When we say that today"s Internet has poor accountability, we mean that it reveals little information about the behavior - or misbehavior - of ISPs.
The second strategy suggests a revision of the contracting system.
In addition, our results provide useful input for clean-slate architectural design, and we use several novel techniques that we expect will be applicable to a variety of future research.
Ultimately, if a judge cannot verify that some condition holds, she cannot enforce a contract based on that condition.
Our study has several practical implications for future protocol design.
The network"s lack of accountability is highly relevant to a discussion of innovation because it constrains the system of contracts.
According to these principles, end hosts should be informed of network problems only to the extent that they are required to adapt.
When the routing decisions of others ignore quality characteristics, ISPs are motivated only to lower costs.
We will approach this problem from a clean-slate perspective, deriving the level of accountability needed to sustain an ideal competitive structure.
We further show that rest of path monitors are required to support such competition games.
The contractible monitor includes whatever distributed algorithmic mechanism is used to motivate ISPs to share this private information.
Many studies before us have noted the Internet"s resistance to new services and evolution.
By cheating, the ISP may save resources, thereby ensuring that the punishment is more damaging to the other ISPs, which probably compete with the cheater directly for some customers.
Although ISPs provide complementary services when they form a data path together, they are likely to be horizontal competitors as well.
Constructing a proof of a particular behavior may require readings from various devices distributed among many ISPs.
Finally, we require that the punishment mechanism that enforces contracts does not punish innocent nodes that are not in the coalition.
One might believe that such market forces apply to ISPs as well.
We show that new monitors must be implemented and integrated with the contracting system before the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation can be overcome.
Nodes cannot condition payments on either quality or path characteristics.
We approach this question from a clean-slate perspective.
We are careful to model our network in continuous time, in order to capture the essence of this argument.
We continue by discussing how such monitors may be constructed using other monitors as building blocks.
Furthermore, we will demonstrate a framework in which an ISP"s maximum research investment decreases hyperbolically with its distance from the end-user.
There is simply no reward for introducing new services or investing in quality improvements.
In response to these pathologies and others, researchers have put forth various proposals for improving the situation.
Alternately, they can be distributed in nature.
This means that without contractible monitors that attest to, say, latency, payments cannot be conditioned on latency.
They argue that such feedback would help reveal which ISPs were adequately meeting their contractual obligations.
This leads us to our next topic: How can we leverage accountability to overcome these pathologies?
This is because contracts depend upon external institutions to function - the judge in the language of incomplete contract theory, or simply the legal system.
Rerouting is likely to prompt end-users to switch providers, punishing access providers who administer punishments correctly.
We describe a way to construct a rest of path monitor out of monitors for individual ISP quality and for the data path.
In another direction, Afergan and Wroclawski suggest that prices should be explicitly encoded in the routing protocols [2].
We make the assumption that all payments are mediated by contracts.
Argyraki, et al., conjecture that applying the principles of layering and transparency may have led to the network"s lack of accountability [3].
This paper will address both issues.
Clark relates this to the network"s military context, and finds that had the network been designed for commercial development, accountability would have been a top priority.
Access providers try to select high quality transit because that increases their quality.
They argue that such a move would improve stability and align incentives.
Such a monitor includes metering or sensing devices on the physical network, but it is a more general concept.
Next, we require that the equilibrium cannot be threatened by a coalition of ISPs that exchanges illicit side payments.
Rest of path monitors can be implemented in various ways.
We can, for example, specify equilibria in which nodes switch to a new next hop in the event of a quality drop.
More importantly, commoditization in the short term is surely related to the lack of innovation in the long term.
Hence, we imagine that a contract only accepts proofs as inputs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we lay out our basic network model.
Nevertheless, the structure is rich enough to expose previously unseen features of network behavior.
We will begin by introducing an economic network model that relates accountability, contracts, competition, and innovation.
On one hand, this leads directly to suboptimal routing.
If innocent nodes may be punished, an ISP may decide to deliberately cheat and draw punishment onto itself and its neighbors.
These can be divided according to three high-level strategies: The first attempts to improve the status quo by empowering end-users.
Our model is highly stylized and may be considered preliminary: it is based on a single source sending data to a single destination.
Access providers try to increase their quality to get more consumers.
In describing the design philosophy behind the Internet protocols, Clark lists accountability as the least important among seven second level goals.
We demonstrate how poor monitoring causes commoditization and a lack of innovation.
Thus, the network has characteristics of a commodity market.
After all, in non-network industries, traditional firms invest in research and differentiate their products, all in the hopes of keeping their customers and securing new ones.
This would not be possible, however, without the judge acting as a last resort.
They notice when packet drops occur so that they can perform congestion control and retransmit packets.
Even with these liberal assumptions, however, we find that we must reject our null hypothesis.
Figure 1 demonstrates how our model of contracts fits together.
Although in theory, ISPs have a plethora of routing policies at their disposal, the prevailing strategy is to route in the cheapest way possible [2].
By contrast, customers in the real world rarely respond collectively, and often simply seek the best deal currently offered.
This is exemplified by MacKie-Mason and Varian, who propose a smart market to control access to network resources [10].
These constraints limit their ability to punish cheaters.
We show that rest of path monitors can support competition games with optimal routing and innovation.
The reader might wonder why the Internet needs contracts at all.
In section 3, we present a  lowaccountability network, modeled after today"s Internet.
In section 4, we present verifiable monitors, and show that proofs, even without contracts, can improve the status quo.
Is there anything wrong with best-effort contracts?
Especially when a judge"s ruling is easily predicted, the parties will typically comply with the contract terms on their own volition.
Prices are set to the market-clearing level based on bids that users associate to their traffic.
Of course, the vast majority of contracts never end up in court.
According to this approach, we first craft a new equilibrium concept appropriate for network competition.
This well-known trait is largely rooted in the network"s history.
In section 6, we conclude and present several directions for future research. 
In this vein, Argyraki, et al., propose a system of packet obituaries to provide feedback as to which ISPs drop packets [3].
Until today, however, the relationship between them has been poorly understood.
We will define an index of commoditization and show that it increases without bound as data paths grow long.
The third high-level strategy calls for greater network accountability.
Details of where and why drops occur are deliberately concealed.
[4] Accordingly, accountability received little attention during the network"s formative years.
They may be purely local algorithms that listen for packet echoes.
On a smaller time scale, ISPs shun new services in favor of cost cutting measures.
Ratnasamy, Shenker, and McCanne postulate a link between network evolution and user-directed routing [11].
The list includes Multicast, IPv6, IntServ, and DiffServ.
