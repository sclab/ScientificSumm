Our technique allows contracts to emerge from a competitive framework, so the source is limited to selecting the most desirable contract.
A quality monitor can never anticipate every dimension of quality that future applications will care about, nor can it anticipate a new and valuable protocol that an ISP introduces.
Because this field is based on a principle-agent framework, contracts are usually proposed by the source, who is allowed to make a take it or leave it offer to network nodes.
To support service differentiation and innovation, it may be easier to design rest of path monitors directly, thereby avoiding the task of designing mechanisms for combining component monitors.
We have shown that adding verifiability to monitors allows for some improvements in the characteristics of competition.
The first is practical: we believe our analysis has implications for the design of future monitoring protocols and for public policy.
While a significant literature addresses innovation in the presence of network effects, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first model of innovation in a network industry that successfully incorporates the actual topological structure as input.
What anti-competitive behaviors are enabled by quality-based contracts?
Even more relevant is the possibility that quality monitors are fundamentally incomplete.
There is no need to worry about who will enforce a punishment against another ISP on the opposite side of the planet, nor is there a dispute over whose legal rules to apply in interpreting a contract.
We may define a monitor space as a subspace of the quality space that a monitor can measure, QM ⊂ , and a corresponding monitoring function that simply projects the full range of qualities onto the monitor space, MQm →: .
Additionally, if the source only has contracts with nodes on the intended path, other nodes won"t even be willing to accept packets from this source since they won"t receive compensation for carrying them.
In this environment, we expect that path monitoring becomes more important, since it is the only way to ensure data reaches certain innovator ISPs.
However, in order for this to happen, a mechanism must be included 192 to combine proofs from these monitors to form a proof of rest of path quality.
We have demonstrated that the network"s monitoring ability is critical to supporting innovation, as are the institutions that support contracting.
Because of this and other encouraging features, we believe source contracts are a fertile topic for further study.
We may call these source contracts.
As quality-based contracts become numerous and complicated, and possibly negotiated by machine, this may become a challenging task, and new standards and regulations may have to emerge in response.
Perhaps its most important benefit is that each contract is local in nature, so both parties share a common, familiar legal jurisdiction.
Based on the insights in this study, the possible directions for future research are numerous and exciting.
From a clean-slate perspective, these monitors can be transparently and fully integrated with the routing and contracting systems.
We included an example in which individual hop quality monitors and a path monitor can also meet our standard for sustaining competition.
In this study, we have focused on bilateral contracts.
Secondly, we suggest directions for future advances in monitoring.
This allows the discovery of new properties, such as the weakening of market forces with the number of ISPs on a data path that we observe with  lowaccountability.
This is not to say that other types of monitors are unimportant.
We believe that the mathematical formalization we present is applicable to a variety of future research questions.
As far as policy implications, our analysis points to the need for legal institutions to enforce contracts based on quality.
We believe this is a closer reflection of the industry.
Another important research task is to relax our assumption that quality can be measured fully and precisely.
Clearly, innovations that leave quality invariant under m are not easy to support - they are invisible to the monitoring system.
This system has seemed natural, especially since it is the prevalent system on the current network.
This paper has suggested a novel standard for monitors to aspire to - one of supporting optimal routes in innovative competition games under fixed-route coalition-proof protect-the-innocent equilibrium.
Our method also stands in contrast to the typical approach of distributed algorithmic mechanism design.
Our analysis specifically suggests that architectures based on bilateral contracts should include contractible rest of path monitoring.
Source contracting may present surprising advantages.
It is our hope that this study will have a positive impact in at least three different ways.
One possibility is to assume that monitoring is only probabilistic or suffers from noise.
In other words, the monitors must ultimately be combined to form contractible rest of path monitors.
We have argued that the poor accountability of the Internet is a fundamental obstacle to alleviating the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation.
Should ISPs be allowed to offer a choice of contracts at different quality levels?
The second area we hope our study will benefit is that of clean-slate architectural design.
This combination seems to eliminate all temptation for a single cheater to cheat in route.
To some degree, contracting based on quality opens a Pandora"s Box of pressing questions: Do quality-based contracts stand counter to the principle of network neutrality?
For protocol designers, we first provide fresh motivation to create monitoring systems.
We have shown that under bilateral contracts, this specifically requires contractible rest of path monitors.
Although this benefit is compelling, it is worth considering other systems.
The clearest alternative is to form a contract between the source and every node on the path.
Further research is needed to understand this process. 
Thus, the approach is often one of engineering, which tends to neglect competitive effects.
These institutions must be equipped to verify proofs of quality, and police illegal contracting behavior.
Traditionally, clean-slate design tends to focus on creating effective and elegant networks for a static set of requirements.
Can a contracting system support optimal multicast trees?
At the same time, this does not present a fully satisfying solution.
These elements should feature prominently in new designs.
We agree with Ratnasamy, Shenker, and McCanne, that designing for evolution should be a top priority [11].
Finally, the last contribution our study makes is methodological.
For instance, since ISPs do not exchange money with each other, an ISP cannot save money by selecting a cheaper next hop.
This remains an interesting and unexplored area for research.
Unless accountability improves, these pathologies are guaranteed to remain.
