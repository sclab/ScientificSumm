If it chooses a new first hop, it might not affect the rest of the data path.
Hence, for the sake of realism, it cannot be used to monitor what the data path is.
Though we suspect stronger claims are possible, we can demonstrate one such result by including an extra assumption: Available Bargain Path: A competitive market exists for  lowcost transit, such that every node can route to the destination for no more than flow payment, lp .
For example, if a node after the first hop starts cheating, the first hop will detect the sudden drop in quality for the rest of the path, but the first hop cannot make the source believe this observation - the 187 source will suspect that the first hop was the cheater, and fabricated the claim against the rest of the path.
To show that this is true, we first need the following lemma, which will establish the difficulty of punishing nodes in the network.
The accountability properties of the Internet can be represented by the following monitors: E2E (End to End): A monitor that informs S/D about what the total path quality is at any time (this is the quality they experience).
So the source must give the first hop this much discounted time in order to punish defectors further down the line (and the source will expect poor quality during this period).
However, it must also pay the nodes on the way to i a premium in order to motivate them to route properly.
CI ranges from 0, when each node spends all of its potential profit on its quality premium, to infinite, when a node absorbs positive profit, but uses the lowest price next hop.
Players cannot measure the qualities of other, single nodes, just the rest of the path.
To measure this tendency, we define an index of commoditization as follows: For a node on the data path, i, define its quality premium, minppd ji −= , where pj is the flow payment to the next hop in equilibrium, and pmin is the price of the lowest cost next hop.
Give us some time to punish them and then normal quality will resume.
The first hop can 188 do this for the full discounted time, ∏ −0 0 hopfirstafter t rt i i i e y π , so the source must punish the first hop long enough to remove the extra profit it can make.
We begin by defining a monitor, our model of the way that players receive external information about network behavior, A monitor is any distributed algorithmic mechanism that runs on the network graph, and outputs, to specific nodes, informational statements about current or past network behavior.
We will call the ratio, iiy π/ , the temptation to cheat.
Under the available bargain path assumption, if node i , a distance n from S, can invest to alter its quality, and the source will spend no more than sP for a route including node i"s new quality, then the payment to node i, p, decreases hyperbolically with n, ( ) ( ) s n l P n T pp 1 1/1 − +≤ − , (4) where ( )01 rt eT − −= is the bound on the product of temptations from the previous claim.
To capture some intuition behind this result, imagine that you are an end user, and you notice a sudden drop in service quality.
LOWACCOUNTABILITY NETWORK In order to motivate an exploration of monitoring systems, we begin in this section by considering a network with a poor degree of accountability, modeled after today"s Internet.
If nodes share a minimum temptation to cheat, π/y , the discounted time needed to punish cheating increases at least exponentially in the length of the data path, n, −− ≥ 0 00 t rt nt rt e y e n π (2) Since it is the discounted time that increases exponentially, the actual time increases faster than exponentially.
If the only monitors are E2E, ROP, and PRc, the discounted time, −nt rt e 0 , needed to punish a cheater increases at least as fast as the product of the temptations to cheat along the data path, ∏ −− ≥ 0 0 pathdataon 0 t rt i i i t rt e y e n π (1) Corollary.
Following the same argument as for 1=n , we can show that the full discounted time is ∏ −0 0 pathdataon t rt i i i e y π , which completes the proof.
Thus, i will spend no more than ( ) ( )− + − s n l P n T p r 1 1 1/1 on this quality improvement, which approaches the bargain path"s payment, r pl , as ∞→n .
By cheating, the node earns extra profit ( ) − − 0 0 t rt ii ey π .
Then we have, [ ] = − = − + + = − + ++ = + −=− −− −− = −− − = −− = n i i n i iii iii n i iii ii n i i iii C g npcp pcp n pcp pp nd pcp n I 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 '1 '11 , (3) where gi is node i"s temptation to cheat by routing to the lowest price next hop.
If nodes tend to route to low price next hops, regardless of quality, we say that the network is commoditized.
It is important to stress that E2E and ROP are not the contractible monitors we described in the introduction - they do not generate proofs.
PRc (Packets Received): A monitor that tells nodes how much data they accept from each other, so that they can charge by volume.
If the source S wants node i to innovate, it needs to get a motivating payment, p, to i during the routing stage.
Recall that this is a requirement in order for nodes to have any incentive to innovate.
A high value for CI implies that nodes are spending little of their money inflow on purchasing high quality for the rest of the path.
When a node cheats, it can expect a higher profit flow, at least until it is caught and other players react, perhaps by diverting traffic.
Hence, the reward for innovation is bounded by the same amount.
On the other hand, you may want to punish your access provider as well, in case he is lying.
One might argue that diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute can identify cheaters.
If node i is then punished until time 1t , the extra profit must be cancelled out by the lost profit between time 0t and 1t , −1 0 t t rt i eπ .
The critical ingredient is that nodes cannot verify that the path avoids a specific hop.
For example, if the source has monitors that reveal the qualities of individual nodes, they could be combined with path information to create an ROP monitor.
Since we know that contracts only accept proofs as input, we can infer that payments in this environment can only depend on the number of packets exchanged between players.
As the next claim shows, this is exactly what happens as the path grows long: Claim 1.
3.2 Modeling Low-Accountability As the above evidence suggests, the current industry allows for very little insight into the behavior of the network.
In fact, it is similarly difficult to identify an ISP that cheats in route.
The monitor then includes the component monitors as well as whatever mechanisms are in place to motivate nodes to share information honestly as needed.
However, as ∞→n , we have 1/1 →n T , which shows that ∞→CI .
The first hop needs discounted time, ∏ −0 0 hopfirstafter t rt i i i e y π , to accomplish this by assumption.
If your access provider is telling the truth, you will want to listen, since switching access providers may not even route around the actual offender.
Definition: The index of commoditization, CI , is the average, over each node on the data path, i, of i"s flow profit as a fraction of i"s quality premium, ( ) ijii dpcp /−− .
Because the source does not know the data path after the first hop, it is unable to punish nodes beyond it.
Huston notes that Internet traffic flows do not always correspond to routing information [8].
We first focus on the routing game and ask whether a high quality route can be maintained, even when a low quality route is cheaper.
For the remainder of this section, we will assume that contracts are also linear - there is a constant payment flow so long as a node accepts data, and all conditions of the contract are met.
Nodes cannot see the path past the next hop.
We will show how the lack of monitoring necessarily leads to poor routing and diminishes the rate of innovation.
Because we further know that nodes cannot observe the path after the next hop, we can infer that contracts exist only between neighboring nodes on the graph.
When you complain to your ISP, he responds, yes, we know your quality went down, but it"s not our fault, it"s the next ISP.
Thus, you will have to accept lower quality service for some longer time.
An ISP may hand a packet off to a neighbor regardless of what routes that neighbor has advertised.
ROP (Rest of Path): A monitor that informs each node along the data path what the quality is for the rest of the path to the destination.
The claim shows that this premium increases with the distance to i, until it dwarfs the original payment, p. Our claims stand in sharp contrast to our null hypothesis from the introduction.
When a competition game exclusively uses bilateral contracts, we will call it a bilateral contract competition game.
According to the claim, as the data path grows long, it increasingly resembles a lowest-price path.
As a further complication, a cheater may assume different aliases for diagnostic packets arriving over different routes.
In this section, we attempt to capture this lack of accountability in our model.
Next, the source must be protected against a first hop that cheats, and pretends that the problem is later in the path.
Let node i"s normal profit flow be iπ , and her profit flow during cheating be some greater value, yi.
Even more fundamentally, a sophisticated cheater can always spot diagnostic packets and give them special treatment.
We believe that our parameter t0 is sufficient to describe lock-in effects, and we believe that the insights in this section apply equally to any tariffs that are bounded so that the routing game remains continuous at infinity.
Claim 2 can alternately be viewed as a lower bound on how much it costs to elicit innovation in a network.
If the only monitors are E2E, ROP, and PRc, ∞→CI as ∞→n , where n is the number of nodes on the data path.
Hence, competitive forces degrade as the network deepens. 
Because of this, the source must rely on the first hop to punish cheating nodes farther along the path.
3.1 Accountability in the Current Internet First, we reflect on what accountability characteristics the present Internet has.
This is not the only way that they could be implemented, however; an alternate strategy is to aggregate quality measurements from multiple points in the network.
This holds, for example, if the path is generally visible, except nodes can use different aliases for different parents.
A little manipulation gives −− = 01 00 t rt i i t rt e y e π , as required.
If your data only travels through your access provider, you know it is that provider"s fault.
The above lemma and its corollary show that punishing cheaters becomes more and more difficult as the data path grows long, until doing so is impossible.
This threat should motivate your provider to maintain high quality.
The proof is given in the appendix.
As more ISPs are added to the path, the time increases in a recursive fashion.
The source does not know whether the cheater is the first hop, or after the first hop.
We will call this arrangement of contracts bilateral.
Unfortunately, Argyraki, et al., explain that these tools only reveal whether probe packets are echoed, not the fate of past packets [3].
Dropped packets may represent the innocent signaling of congestion, or, as we mentioned above, they may be a form of cheating internally.
As we will see below, this gives the cheater a significant advantage in escaping punishment for bad behavior, even if the data path is otherwise observable.
The proof proceeds by induction on the number of nodes on the equilibrium data path, n. For 1=n , there is a single node, say i.
Comparing the intuitive argument that supported our hypothesis with these claims, we can see that we implicitly used an oversimplified model of market pressure (as either present or not).
This last assumption is stricter than needed for our results.
Users know when drops occur, but not where they occur, nor why.
Finding an ISP that gives high priority packets a lower class of service, for example, is further complicated by the lack of even basic diagnostic tools.
First a bit of notation: Recall that a cheater can benefit from its actions for 00 >t before other players can react.
Since lowest-price routing does not support innovation, we may speculate that innovation degrades with the length of the data path.
Thus, for example, they are ineffective in detecting low-frequency packet drops.
Thus, even though a player observes certain information, she generally cannot credibly share it with another player.
With this lemma in hand, we can return to prove Claim 1.
As a node gets farther from the source, its maximum payment approaches the bargain price, pl.
Furthermore, blocks of addresses are summarized together for distant hosts, so a destination may not even be resolvable until packets are forwarded closer.
Restricting attention to linear contracts allows us to represent some node i"s contract by its price, pi.
As is now clear, market pressure relies on the decisions of customers, but these are limited by the lack of information.
Lemma 1 tells us that Tg n i i <∏ =1 , where ( )01 rt eT − −= .
Argyraki, et al., point out that end hosts are given minimal information about packet drops [3].
In other words, contracts are best-effort.
We assume that all external information about network behavior is mediated in this way.
If n is so large that tn is undefined, the given path cannot be maintained in equilibrium.
Similar results also hold if alternate paths always converge after some integer number, m, of hops.
The problem is similar for other dimensions of quality, or in fact more acute.
You can therefore take your business elsewhere, at least for some time.
This means you have to wait longer to resume normal service.
It is important to note, however, that this information is aggregated over many source-destination pairs.
For 1>n , assume for induction that the claim holds for 1−n .
These measurements can originate in other monitors, located at various ISPs.
Large innovations, meaning substantially more expensive than rpl / , will not be pursued deep into the network.
Thus, the network"s lack of accountability is a fundamental obstacle to resolving these pathologies.
Other, more complicated tariffs are also possible, and are typically used to generate lock-in.
It requires a bit of calculus to show that IC is minimized by setting each gi equal to n T /1 .
Proof of Claim 1.
Suppose, on the other hand, that your data traverses two providers.
Fix an equilibrium data path of length n. Label the path nodes 1,2,…,n.
Typically, E2E and ROP are envisioned as algorithms that run on a single node, and listen for packet echoes.
Claim 2.
For each node i, let i"s quality premium be '11 ++ −= iii ppd .
Lemma 1.
