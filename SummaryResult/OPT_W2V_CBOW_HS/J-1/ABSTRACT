Furthermore, our solution provides  budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed  markets with strategic transportation edges.
There have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by  trading welfare for BB, e.g., in domains such as double-sided auctions[13], distributed markets[3] and supply chain  problems[2, 4].
In particular, our results improve on existing  solutions for problems such as double sided markets with  homogenous goods, distributed markets and several kinds of supply chains.
It is well known [15] that it is impossible for a mechanism to maximize social welfare whilst also being IR, IC, and BB.
When designing a mechanism there are several desirable properties to maintain such as incentive compatibility (IC), individual rationality (IR), and budget balance (BB).
In this paper we provide a procedure called a  Generalized Trade Reduction (GTR) for single-value players, which given an IR and IC mechanism, outputs a mechanism which is IR, IC and BB with a loss of welfare.

We bound the welfare achieved by our procedure for a wide range of  domains.
