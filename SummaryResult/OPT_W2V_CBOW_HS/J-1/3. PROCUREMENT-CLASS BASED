In order to show that the produced mechanism is BB we show that each procurement set that is not reduced has a positive budget (i.e., the sum of payments is positive).
As a possible Ei(A, s) is ∪j∈sRj(A, s) one can bound the maximal value of i"s external competition W(Ei(A, s)) by the sum of the maximal values of the rest of the players in s 8 since the domain is a procurement class domain we can use lemma 3.1 24 internal competition i.e., j∈s max W(Rj(A, s)).
Since every pair of (buyer, seller) is a valid  procurement set (albeit possible with negative value) this is a procurement class domain.
We start by proving IR and IC: 6 Although the definition of an X-external mechanism  requires that X intersects every procurement set, this is not strictly necessary.
Let A be the allocation after the procurement sets  reduction by the GTR-1 algorithm.
So for normalized IR7 and IC mechanisms, the allocation rule which is bid monotonic uniquely defines the critical  values for all the players and thus the payments.
Since GTR-1 orders the procurement sets according to  increasing value, if player i increases his bid from bi to bi > bi then for any division function D of procurement sets, the procurement set s containing i always appears later with the bid bi than with the bid bi.
By the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1  nontrading players i have a payment of zero.
As the X-external GTR-1 algorithm is IR and applies the critical value payment scheme according to theorem 3.1, in order to show that the produced X-external mechanism with the critical value payment scheme is IC, it remains to show that the produced mechanism"s allocation rule is bid monotonic.
An allocation rule R is Bid Monotonic if for any player i, any bids of the other players b−i ∈ V−i, and any two possible bids of i, ˆbi > bi, if i trades under the allocation rule R when reporting bi, then i also trades when reporting ˆbi.
The assumption of unique manufactory by [2, 4] can best be understood as turning general supply chains (which need not be a procurement class domain) into a procurement class domain.
By the critical value pricing scheme definition 2.2 it means that if player i bids any less than −W(Ei(A, s)) he will not have external competition and therefore will be removed from trading.
For each sj, starting from the lowest value procurement set: If for every i ∈ sj ∩ X there is external competition and every i ∈ sj \ X there is internal competition then 23 keep sj.
Suppose that i has external competition, then there exists a set of players Ei(A, s) such that {i} ∪ Ei(A, s) ∈ S. Let us denote by sj = {i} ∪ Ei(A, s).
Thus for every player i, value vi, and any b−i ∈ V−i ui(vi, b−i) ≥ 0,  meaning the produced X-external mechanism is IR.
As the F function is defined to be a positive constant we get that W(s) = min −W(Ei(A, s))+( j∈s max W(Rj(A, s)))+F(s) ≥ 0 and thus s is at least budget balanced.
A definition of the mechanism follows: Definition 3.1.
By the definition of a critical value pricing scheme 2.2 and the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1 it follows that for every trading player i, vi ≥ 0.
Let s ∈ S be a procurement set that is not reduced.
A procurement set consists of a single buyer as well as a set of sellers who can satisfy that buyer.
Order the procurement sets by increasing value.
Assume w.l.o.g.8 that i is the only player with external competition in s and all other players j = i, j ∈ s have internal competition.
The proof of the theorem yields bounds on the payments any player has to make to the mechanism. 
Intuitively, a bid monotonic allocation rule ensures that no trading player can become a non-trading player by  improving his bid.
Otherwise reduce the trade sj (i.e., remove every i ∈ sj from the allocation).6 4.
According to the definition of external competition 2.5, there exists a set Ei(A, s) ⊂ N \A such that i ∪ Ei(A, s) ∈ S and W(i ∪ Ei(A, s)) ≥ 0.
In this domain there are two classes.
For procurement class domains for any X, the X-external mechanism with critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-1 algorithm is an IR, IC and BB mechanism.
It is possible to define an X that does not intersect every possible procurement set.
Although procurement class domains appear to be a  relatively restricted model, in fact many domains studied in the literature are procurement class domains.
Each  procurement set consists of a single buyer and a single seller.
Since all other players j ∈ s have internal competition their critical price can not be less than their maximal value  internal competitor (set) i.e., max W(Rj(A, s)).
Since W(i∪Ei(A, s)) = vi +W(Ei(A, s)) then vi ≥ −W(Ei(A, s)).
All trading players are charged the critical value for trading.
An IR mechanism M with allocation rule R is IC if and only if R is Bid Monotonic and each trading player i pays his critical value Ci (pi = Ci).
Theorem 3.1 characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions for a  mechanism for single value players to be IR and IC: Definition 3.2.
So the likelihood of  competition can only increase if i appears in later procurement sets.
As each  procurement set that is not reduced is at least budget balanced, it follows that the produced X-external mechanism is BB.
i ∈ sj and i has external competition than all t = i t ∈ sj, t has internal competition.
The classes are the sets of sellers selling the same good as well as the buyers who desire the same bundle.
Therefore if s has the required competition and is not reduced with bi then it will have the required competition with bi and will not be reduced.
3.1 The GTR-1 Produces an X-external Mechanism that is IR, IC and BB In this subsection we prove that the GTR-1 algorithm produces an X-external mechanism that is IR, IC and BB.
All non trading players are charged nothing.
In this case, any procurement set s ∈ S s.t.
• Spatially distributed markets with non strategic edges [3, 9](problem B.3).
For any X, the X-external mechanism with a critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-1  algorithm is an IR and IC mechanism.
If any player j ∈ s bids less then its maximal internal competitor (set) then he will not be in s but his maximal internal competitor (set) will.
Class of buyers and class of sellers with  procurement sets consisting of single buyer and single seller.
In this domain the constant assigned to the procurement sets is F = 0.
In the following we prove that the X-external GTR-1  algorithm produces a IR, IC and BB mechanism, but first a subsidiary lemma is shown.
For any X, the X-external mechanism with critical value pricing scheme produced by the GTR-1  algorithm is a BB mechanism.
The sellers and buyers are nodes in a graph and the function F is the distance of two nodes (length of the edge) which represent transport costs.
Let i ∈ s ∩ X then according to the definition of X-external definition 2.7 and the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1 i has an external competition.
f defines the required internal competition.
This follows as GTR-1 can reduce more of the lower value procurement sets which will result in more non-trading players.
DOMAINS This section focuses on the problems that are  procurementclass based domains.
The GTR-1 algorithm - given a  mechanism M, a set X ⊂ N which is closed under replacement, a dividing function D, and allocation A, GTR-1 operates as follows: 1.
In this context each seller sells a single good and each buyer wants a set of goods.
To prove GTR-1"s properties we make use of theorem 3.1 which is a well known result (e.g., [14, 11]).
Therefore min −W(Ei(A, s)) = −( j∈s max W(Rj(A, s))).
The class of buyers and the class of sellers.
For this domain, we present an  algorithm called GTR-1, which given a mechanism that is IR and IC outputs a mechanism with reduced welfare which is IR, IC and budget balanced.
This follows from the definition of procurement class domains.
7 Note that this is not true for mechanisms which are not normalized e.g., [7, 12] Lemma 3.2.
, sk ∈ S. 2.
For procurement class domains if there  exists a procurement set sj s.t.
The following domains are procurement class domains: • double-sided auctions with homogenous goods  [13](problem B.1).
Let M1 and M2 be two IR and IC mechanisms with the same allocation rule.
Since the domain is a procurement-class domain there exists a  bijection function f between sj and sj.
Like the double-sided auctions with homogenous goods, their are two classes in the  domain.
Then M1 and M2 must have the same payment rule.
Finally we prove BB: Lemma 3.3.
The special case where X = N has received attention under different guises in various special cases, such as ([13, 3, 4]).
Use the dividing function D to divide A into  procurement sets s1, .
These costs  differ between different (buyer, seller) pairs.
The above two lemmas yield the following theorem: Theorem 3.2.
• Single minded combinatorial auctions [11] (problem B.8).
Thus i pays no less than min −W(Ei(A, s)).
s ∩ X = ∅ will be reduced.
