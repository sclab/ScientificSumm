Since Schelling [24] first noted that the outcome of negotiation depends on the choice of negotiation procedure, much research effort has been devoted to the study of different procedures for negotiating multiple issues.
A number of researchers have also studied negotiations with an endogenous agenda [2].
On the other hand [22] focus on the use of contracts for task allocation to multiple self interested agents but this work concerns finding ways of decommitting contracts (after the initial allocation has been done) so as to improve an agent"s utility.
Now, the agenda can be decided before negotiating the issues (such an agenda is called exogenous) or it may be decided during the process of negotiation (such an agenda is called endogenous).
In contrast, our focuses on negotiation regarding who will carry out which task.
Specifically, no previous work has determined an approximate equilibrium for multi-issue negotiation or for online negotiation.
Existing work for the case of indivisible issues has mostly dealt with task allocation problems (for tasks that cannot be partioned) to a group of agents.
Here the term agenda refers to the order in which the issues are negotiated.
In contrast to the above work that mainly deals with sequential negotiation, [6] studies the equilibrium for the package deal  procedure.
In contrast, our focus is on two agents where both of them are self-interested and want to maximize their individual  utilities.
The agenda is important because each agent"s cumulative utility depends on the agenda; if we change the agenda then these utilities change.
The problem of task allocation has been  previously studied in the context of coalitions involving more than two agents.
Finally, online and approximate mechanisms have been studied in the context of auctions [14, 9] but not for bilateral negotiations (which is the focus of our work). 
For this procedure, a key issue is the  negotiation agenda.
Work on multi-issue negotiation can be divided into two main types: that for indivisible issues and that for divisible issues.
For instance, Fershtman [7] analyze  sequential negotiation with exogenous agenda.
We first describe the existing work for the case of divisible issues.
However, all the above mentioned work differs from ours in that we focus on indivisible issues while others focus on the case The Sixth Intl.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 957 where each issue is divisible.
However, most of this work has focussed on the  sequential procedure [7, 2].
For example [25] analyze the problem for the case where the agents act so as to maximize the benefit of the system as a whole.
Hence, the agents must decide what agenda they will use.
