Finally, we extended the analysis to online negotiation where the issues  become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about the features of these issues.
Specifically, we first showed that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem even in a complete information  setting.
It will be interesting to analyze the case where ka c and kb c have other, possibly different, probability  distributions.
Specifically, we showed that an approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and analysed the approximation error.
Thus, the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate the issues between themselves so as to maximize their individual utilities.
We then presented approximately optimal negotiation  strategies and showed that they form an equilibrium.
First, for online negotiation, we assumed that the constants ka c and kb c are both uniformly distributed.
In future, it will be interesting to treat the number of issues as uncertain. 
This paper has studied bilateral multi-issue negotiation between self-interested autonomous agents with time constraints.
The issues are indivisible and different agents value different issues  differently.
These approximate strategies also have polynomial time complexity.
Apart from this, we treated the number of issues as being common knowledge to the agents.
We also analysed the difference between the true optimum and the approximate optimum.
These strategies have polynomial time complexity.
There are several interesting directions for future work.
