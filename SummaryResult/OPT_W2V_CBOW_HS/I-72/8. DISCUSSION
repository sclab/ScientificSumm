While they study the effect of time on negotiation, our focus is on learning preferences for a successful negotiation.
Further, we have built a system with which negotiation preferences can be learned.
Although we address a similar problem, we learn the preferences of the  customer by the help of inductive learning and generate counter-offers in accordance with these learned preferences.
study the factors that affect the negotiation such as preferences, deadline, price and so on, since the agent who  develops a strategy against its opponent should consider all of them [5].
On the contrary, we learn these preferences over time.
In their experiments, Faratin et al.
According to their approach, the negotiation protocols used in e-commerce can be modeled as ontologies.
In their approach, the goal of the seller agent is to sell the service for the highest possible price whereas the goal of the buyer agent is to buy the good with the lowest possible price.
[16] propose a new approach based on ontology for  negotiation.
Contrary to our approach, Sadri et al.
propose a multi-issue negotiation mechanism, where the service variables for the negotiation such as price, quality of the service, and so on are considered traded-offs against each other (i.e., higher price for earlier delivery) [4].
They generate a  heuristic model for trade-offs including fuzzy similarity estimation and a hill-climbing exploration for possibly acceptable offers.
In our future work, we plan to integrate ontology reasoning into the learning algorithm so that hierarchical information can be learned from subsumption hierarchy of relations.
For achieving this, they use case-based reasoning.
Unlike them, we also take into  account the previous requests of the consumer.
"s study is not concerned with learning preferences of each other.
After the consumer and  producer agree on the service, price-oriented negotiation mechanisms can be used to agree on the price.
Brzostowski and Kowalczyk propose an approach to select an  appropriate negotiation partner by investigating previous multi-attribute negotiations [1].
Compared to Fatima et al.
A mechanism which is based on dialogue sequences among agents is proposed as a solution.
In our approach, we are interested in negotiation the content of the service.
our focus is different.
only use the last offer made by the consumer in calculating the  similarity for choosing counter offer.
We review the recent literature in comparison to our work.
Their approach is probabilistic since the behavior of the partners can change at each iteration.
model the negotiation protocol using ontologies, we have instead modeled the service to be negotiated.
Further, by using  relationships among features, the producer can discover new  knowledge from the existing knowledge.
Thus, the agents can perform negotiation protocol by using this shared ontology without the need of being hard coded of negotiation protocol details.
These are interesting directions that we will pursue in our future work. 
The mechanism relies on observe-think-action agent cycle.
study negotiation in the context of resource  allocation [14].

Faratin et al.
Fatima et al.
Time interval  affects these agents differently.
Sadri et al.
Agents have limited resources and need to require  missing resources from other agents.
Tama et al.
assume that the weights for service variables are fixed a priori.
These  dialogues include offering resources, resource exchanges and offering alternative resource.
Each agent in the system plans its actions to reach a goal state.
