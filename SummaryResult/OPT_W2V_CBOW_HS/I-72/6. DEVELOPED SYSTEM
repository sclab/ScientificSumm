Also a  variety of wine types are described in this ontology such as Burgundy, Chardonnay, CheninBlanc and so on.
Thus, all  possible values for the components of the wine concept such as color, body, sugar and so on can be reached by both agents.
Ontology involves the  individuals of this class.
For instance, we can represent the information Europe Continent covers  Western Country.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) For some features such as body, flavor and sugar, there is no hierarchical information, but their values are semantically leveled.
In addition to wine description, the hierarchical information of some features can be inferred from the ontology.
The consumer agent and the producer agent obtain the possible values for the these properties by querying the ontology.
According to the ontology, seven properties make up the wine concept.
In this part, some reasoning can be made such as if a concept X covers Y and Y covers Z, then concept X covers Z.
All participants of the  negotiation use this ontology for understanding each other.
This class is necessary for the producer to record the wines that it sells.
The producer agent is fully automated and the learning and service offering operations work as explained before.
We have prepared two separate WineStock ontologies for testing.
It includes the description of wine as a concept and different types of wine.
When that is the case, we give the reasonable similarity values for these features.
The individuals represent available services that the producer owns.
WineStock Ontology is the producer"s inventory and describes a product class as WineProduct.
This  hierarchical information is used in estimation of semantic similarity.
Western Country covers French Region, which covers some territories such as Loire, Bordeaux and so on.
Intuitively, any wine type  described in the ontology also represents a wine concept.
To ease testing of the system, the consumer agent has a user interface that allows us to enter various requests.
The shared ontology is the modified version of the Wine Ontology [19].
1306 The Sixth Intl.
This allows us to consider instances of Chardonnay wine as instances of Wine class.
For example, the body can be light, medium, or strong.
In the first ontology, there are 19 available wine products and in the second ontology, there are 50 products. 
In this section, we explain the implementation details of the developed system.
For example, Europe Continent covers Bordeaux.
We use OWL [11] as our ontology language and JENA as our ontology reasoner.
We have implemented our architecture in Java.
In this case, we assume that light is 0.66 similar to medium but only 0.33 to strong.
