To this end, we explore different approaches for ranking web search results using real user behavior obtained as part of normal interactions with the web search engine.
Our paper explores whether implicit feedback can be helpful in realistic environments, where user feedback can be noisy (or adversarial) and a web search engine already uses hundreds of features and is heavily tuned.
• An application of a robust implicit feedback model derived from mining millions of user interactions with a major web search engine (Section 4).
While it is intuitive that user interactions with the web search engine should reveal at least some information that could be used for ranking, estimating user preferences in real web search settings is a challenging problem, since real user interactions tend to be more noisy than commonly assumed in the controlled settings of previous studies.
These interactions can serve as a valuable source of information for tuning and improving web search result ranking and can compliment more costly explicit judgments.
Recent work by Joachims and others exploring implicit feedback in controlled environments have shown the value of incorporating implicit feedback into the ranking process.
Our motivation for this work is to understand how implicit feedback can be used in a large-scale operational environment to improve retrieval.
• A large scale evaluation over real user queries and search results, showing significant improvements derived from incorporating user feedback (Section 6).
The specific contributions of this paper include: • Analysis of alternatives for incorporating user behavior into web search ranking (Section 3).
Implicit relevance feedback for ranking and personalization has become an active area of research.
They issue queries, follow some of the links in the results, click on ads, spend time on pages, reformulate their queries, and perform other actions.
Millions of users interact with search engines daily.
How does it compare to and compliment evidence from page content, anchor text, or link-based features such as inlinks or PageRank?
We summarize our findings and discuss extensions to the current work in Section 7, which concludes the paper.
