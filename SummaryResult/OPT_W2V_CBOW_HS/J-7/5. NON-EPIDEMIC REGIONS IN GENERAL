Thus, recalling that q > 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy AB is q(zAB + zB) + (1 − q)zA − c. In order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − q)zA ≥ c. (1) Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is increased by one.
Assume, for contradiction, that there is a Δ-regular graph G and values q > 1/2 and r, a set T of vertices of G that are initially endowed with the strategy A, and a schedule S of moves for vertices in V (G) \ T such that this sequence leads to an all-A equilibrium.
In order for XA,B to be constant for such moves, it must be that zA (the number of neighbors of u in A) equals zB (the number of neighbors of u in B) and, as nAB = 0, we have that zA = zB = Δ/2.
We first show that if q is close enough to 1/2 and r is chosen  appropriately, this potential function is non-increasing.
This next theorem shows that for any Δ, there is a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1 2 .
GRAPHS The characterization theorem in the previous section provides one way of thinking about the region Ω(G), the set of all (q, r) pairs for which A can become epidemic in the game (G, q, r).
Note u"s payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy A is (1 − q)(zAB + zA).
Thus, the only moves involve a node u switching from strategy B to strategy A.
This means that there is a setting of the  parameters q and r for which the new technology A is superior, but for which the incumbent technology is guaranteed to survive regardless of the underlying network.
Substituting our choice of parameters, (and noting that q ∈ [1/4, 1/2] and zAB ≤ Δ), we see that the term inside the ceiling is less than 1 and at least 3/64 3/4 − 1/32 1/2 > 0.
Furthermore, let nAB denote the number of agents using the strategy AB.
The first theorem shows that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to Ω.
Recalling that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy AB is (1 − q)(zAB + zA) + qzB − c. In order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zAB + (1 − q)zA ≥ c. (2) Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is increased by one.
In order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that qzB ≤ c. (3) Such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the  potential function of qzB −c as zB edges are added to the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is decreased by one.
As c is irrational and the  remaining terms are always rational, both nAB and XA,B must remain constant for the potential function as a whole to remain constant.
We now consider the region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r)  values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network.
Thus, the payoff of u for strategy A is (1 − q)zA < Δ/4 whereas her payoff for strategy AB is (1−q)zA +qzB −c > Δ/2−q ≥ Δ/4.
Again, there are three cases corresponding to the three possible strategy changes for a node u.
Since q > 1 2 implies that the incumbent technology B is superior, it implies that in any network, a superior incumbent will survive for any level of compatibility.
Furthermore, as zA can take only finitely many values (zA ∈ {0, 1, .
At any state in the game, let XA,B denote the number of edges in G that have one endpoint using strategy A and the other endpoint  using strategy B.
For every Δ-regular graph G and parameters q and r, the technology A cannot become an epidemic in the game (G, q, r) if q > 1/2.
Specifically, let q = 1 2 − 1 64Δ and c = rΔ = α, where α is any irrational number strictly between 3/64 and q.
We have shown the potential function is non-increasing for our choice of q and c. This implies the potential function is eventually constant.
Therefore we have three cases: a node u switches from strategy B to AB, a node u switches from strategy AB to A, or a node u switches from strategy B to A.
This change will be  negative so long as zA > c/q which holds by inequality 1 as q > (1−q) for q > 1/2.
As nAB is constant and A is epidemic, it must be that nAB = 0.
We derive a contradiction by defining a non-negative 80 potential function that starts with a finite value and showing that after each best response by some vertex the value of this function decreases by some positive amount bounded away from zero.
Case 2: AB → A. Recalling that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategy AB is (1 − q)(zAB + zA) + qzB − c whereas her payoff with strategy A is (1 − q)(zAB + zA).
We now show that every best response move decreases the value of this function by some positive amount bounded away from zero.
This contradicts the assumption that u is playing her best response by switching to A. 
There exist q < 1/2 and r such that for every contagion game (G, q, r), A cannot become epidemic.
In order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zAB ≥ qzB − (1 − q)zA.
This change will be non-positive so long as zB ≤ c/q, which holds by inequality 3.
(4) Such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of q(zB − zA) as zA edges are removed and zB edges are added to the XA,B edges between A and B.
Since G has bounded degree and the initial set T is finite, the initial value of this potential function is finite.
Let zAB, zA, and zB denote the number of neighbors of u in partition piece AB, A, and B respectively.
By inequality 4 and the fact that zA is an integer, zA ≥  qzB 1 − q + (1 − 2q)zAB 1 − q .
, Δ}), this change is bounded away from zero.
The potential function is the following: qXA,B + cnAB (recall c = Δr is the cost of adopting two technologies).
Suppose a node u with strategy B switches to strategy AB.
By inequality 2 and the fact that zA is an integer, zA ≥ ‰ c 1 − q − (1 − 2q)zAB 1 − q ı .
Let zAB, zA, and zB denote the number of neighbors of node u in partition piece AB, A, and B respectively.
The proof is based on the potential function from  Theorem 5.1: qXA,B + cnAB.
Substituting our choice of parameters, it is easy to see that the term inside the floor is at most zB + 1/4, and so the floor is at most zB as zB is an integer.
We consider the first case here; the proofs for the other cases are similar.
Suppose A is epidemic in this region.
By Lemma 4.1, we only need to analyze the effect on the potential function for moves of the sort described by the lemma.
Thus, the ceiling is one, which is larger than c/q.
This change will be  nonpositive so long as zA ≥ c/q.
Case 3: B → A.
This change will be negative so long as zB < zA.
Case 1: B → AB.
The analysis here uses Lemma 4.1 and an argument based on an appropriately defined potential function.
