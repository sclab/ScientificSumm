Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with  technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any  sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and the vertices in SB have strategy B.
The inequalities for the vertices v ∈ SB can be derived in a similar manner.
Then for any schedule S of vertices in V (G) \ T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many times, the outcome of the game using the schedule S is also the all-A equilibrium.
For every infinite sequence S of vertices in V (G) \ T, there is a unique state s such that s0 S → s, where s0 denotes the initial state where every vertex in T plays A and every vertex in V (G) \ T plays B.
Then the same sequence of inequalities as in Lemma 4.1 show that AB is a better response than B for π(vi) (although A might be the best response) and so π(vi) switches to either AB or A.
A pair (SAB, SB) of disjoint subsets of V (G) is called a blocking  structure for this game if for every vertex v ∈ SAB, degSB (v) > r q Δ, and for every vertex v ∈ SB, (1 − q) degSB (v) + min(q, 1 − q) degSAB (v) > (1 − q − r)Δ, and degSB (v) + q degSAB (v) > (1 − q)Δ, where degS(v) denotes the number of neighbors of v in the set S. THEOREM 4.6.
We show for any vi ∈ S, if vi switches to AB, then π(vi) switches to AB or A, and if vi switches to A, then π(vi) switches to A (here v switches to X means that after the best-response move, the strategy of v is X).
We first show that if every co-finite set of vertices of G contains a blocking structure, then technology A cannot become epidemic.
Thus, for agent v in state sk, 1.
q degSB (v) + max(q, 1 − q) degSAB −Δr > (1− q) degSAB (v), from where it follows that degSB (v) > (rΔ)/q.
We show AB is a better strategy than A for v. To show this, we must prove that (1 − q)zA + qzB + max(q, 1 − q)zAB − Δr > (1 − q)(zA + zAB) or, equivalently, the quantity Q ≡ qzB + max(2q − 1, 0)zAB − Δr > 0: Q = (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ − max(2q − 1, 0)zA +(q − max(2q − 1, 0))zB ≥ (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ + min(q, 1 − q) degSB (v) − max(2q − 1, 0)(Δ − degSB (v) − degSAB (v)) ≥ [min(q, 1 − q) + max(2q − 1, 0)] degSB (v) − rΔ = q degSB (v) − rΔ > 0, where the last inequality holds by the definition of the blocking structure.
A >k v AB if (1− q)(zk A + zk AB) is greater than (1− q)zk A + qzk B + max(q, 1 − q)zk AB − Δr, 3. and AB >k v B if (1−q)zk A +qzk B +max(q, 1−q)zk AB −Δr is greater than q(zk B + zk AB).
Thus, the change Q in payoff between AB and B (plus Δr) is Q ≡ (1 − q)zi A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zi AB ≥ (1 − q)(zi A − zj A + zj A) + max(0, 1 − 2q)(zj AB − zi A + zj A) = (1 − q)zj A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj AB + max(q, 1 − q)(zi A − zj A) ≥ (1 − q)zj A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj AB ≥ Δr, and so, by inequality 3, B can not be a better response than AB for v in state si.
Thus, either 1. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = B, or 2. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = AB, or 3. si(v) = AB and si+1(v) = B.
Then for every i, one of the following holds: • si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = A, • si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = AB, • si(vi+1) = AB and si+1(vi+1) = A, • si(vi+1) = si+1(vi+1).
Lemma 4.1 shows that the outcome of a game is well-defined and unique.
Let SAB be the set of vertices with  strategy AB and SB be the set of vertices with strategy B in this outcome.
Consider a contagion game (G, q, r), a subset T ⊆ V (G), and a schedule S of vertices in V (G) \ T such that the outcome of the game is the all-A equilibrium.
We begin with the following lemma, which proves that agents eventually converge to a fixed strategy, and so the final state of a game is well-defined by its initial state and an infinite sequence of moves.
Suppose v ∈ SAB (the other cases are similar).
Let v = vi+1 be the agent who played her best response at time i.
Since this was a best-response move for v,  inequality 3 implies that (1 − q)zj A + max(0, 1 − 2q)zj AB ≥ Δr.
Suppose not and let v be the first vertex in sequence S to violate this (i.e., v ∈ SAB switches to A or v ∈ SB switches to A or AB).
Then for every two schedules S and S of vertices in V (G)\T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many times in each of these schedules, the outcomes of the game using these schedules are the same.
For every contagion game (G, q, r),  technology A cannot become epidemic in this game if and only if every co-finite set of vertices of G contains a blocking structure.
We next show that A cannot become epidemic if and only if  every co-finite set of vertices contains a blocking structure.
Note that S is a subsequence of S .
Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a  (possibly infinite) subset T ⊆ V (G) of agents.
To  construct a blocking structure for the complement of a finite set T of vertices, endow T with strategy A and consider the outcome of the game for any sequence S which schedules each vertex an  infinite number of times.
Finally, we prove the characterization  mentioned in the introduction: A cannot become epidemic if and only if (G, q, r) possesses a certain kind of blocking structure.
Furthermore, as i is the earliest time at which the lemma is  violated, zi A ≥ zj A and zj AB − zi AB ≤ zi A − zj A.
Consider a contagion game (G, q, r).
Let sT be the strategy profile assigning A to every agent in T and B to every agent in V (G) \ T. Let S = v1, v2, .
The second theorem states that the outcome of a game is the same for any schedule of moves in which every vertex moves infinitely many times.
Thus, after an infinite number of best-response moves, each agent converges to a single strategy.
The first theorem states that if the all-A equilibrium is the outcome of a game for some (unconstrained) schedule, then it is the outcome for any schedule in which each vertex is allowed to move infinitely many times.
Let zA, zB, and zAB denote the number of neighbors of v with strategies A, B, and AB respectively.
Then, by Lemma 4.1 and the choice of i, zA ≥ zA, zB ≤ zB, zAB − zAB ≤ zB − zB, and zAB − zAB ≤ zA − zA.
This is because the inequalities defining blocking structures are linear inequalities in q and r, and the coefficients of these inequalities can take only finitely many values. 
be a (possibly infinite) sequence of number of copies of each vertex of V (G) \ T can be turned into an equivalent schedule of moves.
Note for any v ∈ SAB, AB is a best-response and so is strictly better than strategy A, i.e.
Now suppose vi switches to AB.
Such a state s is called the outcome of the game (G, q, r) starting from T and using the schedule S. Equivalence of best-response schedules.
Specifically, we prove that once an agent decides to adopt technology A, she never discards it, and once she decides to discard technology B, she never re-adopts it.
A >k v B if (1 − q)(zk A + zk AB) is greater than q(zk B + zk AB), 2.
Let X >k v Y indicate that agent v (weakly) prefers strategy X to strategy Y in state sk.
We then discuss some respects in which the equilibrium reached from an initial state is essentially independent of the order in which best-response  updates are performed.
Let zA, zB, and zAB be the number of neighbors of vi with strategies A, B, and AB in the current state defined by S. Define zA,zB, and zAB similarly for S .
The following theorems show that the outcome is also invariant to the dynamics, or sequence of best-response moves, under certain mild conditions.
The other case (vi switches to A) is similar.
A corollary to the above theorem is that for every infinite graph G, the epidemic regions in the q-r plane for this graph is a finite union of bounded and unbounded polygons.
Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a  subset T ⊆ V (G).
Suppose the lemma is false and consider the smallest i such that the lemma is violated.
As v is the first vertex violating the claim, zA ≤ Δ− degSB (v)− degSAB (v) and zB ≥ degSB (v).
This  result generalizes Morris"s theorem on the contagion threshold for his model; in his case without AB as a possible strategy, a simpler kind of community structure was the obstacle to A becoming epidemic.
Suppose not and let i be the smallest integer such that the statement doesn"t hold.
gives the same outcome as 1, −1, 2, −2, .
We show that in the third case, agent v could not have been playing a best response.
For any k let zk A, zk B, and zk AB be the number of neighbors of v with strategies A, B, and AB in state sk, respectively.
in the thick line example.
agents in V (G) \ T and consider the sequence of states s1, s2, .
To this end, we must first argue that contagion games in fact have well-defined and stable equilibria.
We begin by defining the blocking structures.
In this section, we characterize equilibrium properties of  contagion games.
As si(v) = AB, there must be a time j < i where sj v → sj+1 and sj+1(v) = AB.
The proof of this theorem is similar to that of  theorem 4.3 and is deferred to the full version of the paper.
In the third case, we have si(v) = AB and si+1(v) = B.
Let π : S → S be the injection mapping S to its subsequence in S .
obtained by allowing agents to play their best-response in the order defined by S (i.e., s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · ).
