After a small decay in hit rate values, the hit rate stabilizes between 0.28, and 0.34 for the entire week, suggesting that the static cache is effective for a whole week after the training period.
To estimate the time interval in which we need to recompute the posting lists on the static cache we need to consider an efficiency/quality trade-off: using too short a time interval might be prohibitively expensive, while  recomputing the cache too infrequently might lead to having an obsolete cache not corresponding to the statistical  characteristics of the current query stream.

The high correlation among the query term frequencies during different time periods explains the graceful adaptation of the static caching algorithms to the future query stream.
To simulate a realistic scenario, we use the first 6 (3) weeks of the query stream for computing query term frequencies and the following 9 (12) weeks to estimate the hit rate.
We compute the query term frequencies over the whole stream, select which terms to cache, and then compute the hit rate on the whole query stream.
We then compute the hit rate of a static cache of 128, 000 answers trained over a period of two weeks (Figure 13).
We measured the effect on the QtfDf algorithm of the changes in a 15-week query stream (Figure 14).
To support this claim, we first assess how topics change comparing the distribution of queries from the first week in June, 2006, to the  distribution of queries for the remainder of 2006 that did not appear in the first week in June.
The majority of queries that appear in a given week repeat in the following weeks for the next six months.
This hit rate is as an upper bound, and it assumes perfect knowledge of the query term frequencies.
We report hit rate hourly for 7 days, starting from 5pm.
We found that a very small  percentage of queries are new queries.
For our query log, the query distribution and query-term distribution change slowly over time.
The static cache of posting lists can be periodically  recomputed.
As Figure 14 shows, the hit rate decreases by less than 2%.
We observe that the hit rate reaches its highest value during the night (around midnight), whereas around 2-3pm it reaches its minimum.
Indeed, the pairwise correlation among all possible 3-week periods of the 15-week query stream is over 99.5%.
