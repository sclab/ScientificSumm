In addition to the above two static algorithms we consider the following algorithms for dynamic caching: • LRU: A standard LRU algorithm, but many posting lists might need to be evicted (in order of least-recent usage) until there is enough space in the memory to place the currently accessed posting list; • LFU: A standard LFU algorithm (eviction of the  leastfrequently used), with the same modification as the LRU; • Dyn-QtfDf: A dynamic version of the QtfDf  algorithm; evict from the cache the term(s) with the lowest fq(t) fd(t) ratio.
For the dynamic algorithms, we load the cache with terms in order of fq(t) and we let the cache warm up for 1  million queries.
We use fq(t) to denote the query-term frequency of a term t, that is, the number of queries  containing t in the query log, and fd(t) to denote the document frequency of t, that is, the number of documents in the  collection in which the term t appears.
In fact, the problem of selecting the best posting lists for the static cache corresponds to the  standard Knapsack problem: given a knapsack of fixed  capacity, and a set of n items, such as the i-th item has value ci and size si, select the set of items that fit in the knapsack and maximize the overall value.
The first strategy we consider is the algorithm proposed by Baeza-Yates and Saint-Jean [2], which consists in selecting the posting lists of the terms with the highest query-term frequencies fq(t).
Thus, we employ a simple algorithm for the knapsack problem, which is selecting the posting lists of the terms with the highest values of the ratio fq(t) fd(t) .

As we show in Section 7 the results do not change much if we compute the query-term frequencies using the first 3 or 4 weeks of the query log and measure the hit rate on the rest.
The most important observation from our experiments is that the static QtfDf algorithm has a better hit rate than all the dynamic algorithms.
The posting lists have variable size (in fact, their size distribution follows a power law), so it is  beneficial for a caching policy to consider the sizes of the posting lists.
In this section we study the problem of how to select  posting lists to place on a certain amount of available memory, assuming that the whole index is larger than the amount of memory available.
Terms with high fq(t) are useful to keep in the cache because they are queried often.
For the static algorithms, we assume complete knowledge of the frequencies fq(t), that is, we estimate fq(t) from the whole query stream.
The cache size is measured as a fraction of the total space required to store the posting lists of all terms.
The previous section shows that caching posting lists can obtain a higher hit rate compared to caching query answers.
We tried other variations considering query frequencies instead of term frequencies, but the gain was minimal compared to the complexity added.
On the other hand, terms with high fd(t) are not good candidates because they  correspond to long posting lists and consume a substantial amount of space.
An important benefit a static cache is that it requires no eviction and it is hence more efficient when evaluating queries.
We consider both dynamic and static caching.
In our case, value  corresponds to fq(t) and size corresponds to fd(t).
However, if the  characteristics of the query traffic change frequently over time, then it requires re-populating the cache often or there will be a significant impact on hit rate. 
For  dynamic caching, we use two well-known policies, LRU and LFU, as well as a modified algorithm that takes posting-list size into account.
The performance of all the above algorithms for 15 weeks of the query log and the UK dataset are shown in Figure 8.
We observe that there is a trade-off between fq(t) and fd(t).
Performance is measured with hit rate.
Before discussing the static caching strategies, we  introduce some notation.
We call this algorithm QtfDf.
We call this algorithm Qtf.
