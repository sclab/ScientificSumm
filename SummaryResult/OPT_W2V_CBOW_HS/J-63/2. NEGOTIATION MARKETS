Each seller i is associated with exactly one good Ai, for which she has true valuation ci which expresses the price at which it is beneficial for her to sell the good.
Negotiation-Range Mechanism: A  mechanism that computes a ZOPA, (L, H), for each matched buyer and seller in T∗ , and provides the buyer with the upper bound H and the seller with the lower bound L. The basic assumption is that participants in the auction are self-interested players.
The utility for a buyer who does not participate in the trade is 0.
If the seller reports a false valuation at an attempt to improve the auction results for her, this valuation is denoted ˆci.
If buyer j is matched by the mechanism with seller i then Ti(Ai) = −1 and Tj(Ai) = 1.
• The buyer"s top utility is: vj(i) − L, and the buyer"s bottom utility is vj(i) − H. • The seller"s top utility is H, with surplus H − ci, and the seller"s bottom utility is L, with surplus L − ci. 
Let Ti ∈ {−1, 0, 1}t denote an exchange vector for a trade, such that player i buys goods {A ∈ Ψ|Ti (A) = 1} and sells goods {A ∈ Ψ|Ti (A) = −1}.
For a seller, if she keeps the good unsold, her utility is just her valuation of the good, and the surplus is 0.
We view T as  describing the allocation of goods by the mechanism to the buyers and sellers.
Consider a buyer j - seller i pair matched by a negotiation-range mechanism and let (L, H) be their associated negotiation range.
Since negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the range of prices rather than the final price, it is useful to define the upper and lower bounds on the player"s utilities defined by the range"s limits.
Given and allocation T, the gain from trade associated with T is V = j∈M,i∈N (vj(i) − ci) · Tj(Ai).
PRELIMINARIES Let Π denote the set of players, N the set of n  selling players, and M the set of m buying players, where Π = N ∪ M. Let Ψ = {1, ..., t} denote the set of goods.
When players" report false valuations we use ˆT∗ and ˆV ∗ to denote the optimal allocation and gain from trade,  respectively, when computed according to the reported valuations.
If she gets to sell it, her utility is the price she is paid for it, and the surplus is the difference between this price and her valuation.
The ZOPA is a range, (L, H), 0 ≤ L ≤ H, where H is an upper bound (ceiling) price for the buyer and L is a lower bound (floor) price for the seller.
In the single-unit heterogeneous setting every good  belongs to specific seller, and every buyer is interested in  buying one good.
For a matched buyer j - seller i pair, the gain from trade on the deal is defined as vj(i) − ci.
At the end of the auction every good is either assigned to one of the buyers who bid for it or kept unsold by the seller.
Let V ∗ denote the optimal gain from trade  associated with this allocation.
The mechanism would provide the buyer with the upper bound on the range and the seller with the lower bound on the range.
Notice, that in our setting for every k = i, Ti(Ak) = 0 and Tj(Ai) = 0 and also for every z = j, Tz(Ai) = 0.
Let T∗ denote the optimal allocation which maximizes the gain from trade, computed according to the players" true valuations.
In contrast to a standard auction mechanism where the buyer and seller are provided with the prices they should pay, the goal of a negotiation-range mechanism is to provide the player"s with a range of prices within which they can negotiate the final terms of the deal by themselves.
Similarly, if he reports a false valuation it is denoted ˆvj(k).
A buyer has a  valuation vector describing his valuation for each of the goods according to their owner.
If he does win some good, his utility is the surplus between his valuation for that good and the price he pays.
The buyer may bid for several or all goods.
It is convenient to assume the sets of buyers and sellers are disjoint (though it is not required), i.e.
Specifically, vj(k) denotes buyer j"s valuation for good Ak.
Negotiation Range: Zone Of Possible  Agreements, ZOPA, between a matched buyer and seller.
That is their main goal is to maximize their expected utility.
2 We are interested in the design of negotiation-range  mechanisms.
Let T = (T1, ..., T|Π|) denote the complete trade between all players.
This gives each of them a promise that it will be beneficial for them to close the deal, but does not provide information about the other player"s terms of negotiation.
