If we  removed from the optimal allocation T ∗ the contribution of the buyer j - seller i pair, we are left with an allocation which excludes j, and has value V ∗ − (vj(i) − ci).

Consider a buyer j who is matched with seller i according to his true valuation v. Consider that j is reporting instead a false valuation ˆv which results in a different allocation in which j is matched with seller k = i.
Similarly since j is allocated Ai in ˆT∗ , we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an  allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(i)+vj(i) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ , which together with the previous inequality completes the proof.
Assume that when the  mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, seller k = i is matched with j and the negotiation-range assigned is (ˆLk, ˆHj).
Since all sellers in this path are matched in ( ˆT−k )∗ , we have that seller k does not belong to P. Since in this case S1 = i and the rest of the sellers in P are matched in (T−i −j )∗ we have that seller i as well does not belong to P. This ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3).
If we remove this pair and instead match j with k we obtain a matching which excludes i, if the gain from trade on the new pair is taken according to the true valuation then we get ( ˆV −k )∗ − (ˆvj(i) − ci) + (vj(k) − ck) ≤ (V −i )∗ .
The fact that ZOPAS is a budget-balanced mechanism follows from the following lemma which ensures the validity of the negotiation range, i.e., that every seller"s floor is below her matched buyer"s ceiling.
(7) Notice that the first inequality of (6) always holds for a valid negotiation range mechanism (Lemma 1).
(9) Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .
The mechanism then allocates buyers to sellers by computing the allocation T ∗ , which results in the optimal gain from trade V ∗ , and defines a ZOPA for each buyer-seller pair.
The following claim handles the case where a seller that was not matched in T ∗ falsely understates her valuation such that she gets matched n ˆT∗ .
Let j be a buyer not matched in T ∗ , and  assume seller k is matched to j in ˆT∗ .
This means that the sum of values of these new allocations is at most V ∗ + (V −i −j )∗ , which proves (1).
Since all sellers in this path are matched in (T−i )∗ , we have that seller i does not belong to P. This ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3).
The buyer ceiling for player j who was matched with seller i on good Ai, i.e., Tj(Ai) = 1, is computed as: Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ .
The scenario of this claim occurs if j did not buy in the truth-telling allocation and overstates his value for Ak, ˆvj(k) > vj(k) in his false valuation.
It is left to prove (9) when j is not matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .
Denote by (V −i )∗ the total gain from trade in the allocation (T−i )∗ .
It follows that in order to prove (11) we need to show V ∗ ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ .
We are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to P. Since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges that were colored 1, which are part of (T −i )∗ , may now be colored 4, and be included in the allocation (T −i −j ) .
Now, since the optimal allocation ˆT∗ matches j with k rather than with i we have that (V −i −j )∗ + (ˆvj(i) − ci) ≤ ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + (ˆvj(k) − ck), where we have used that ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ since these  allocations exclude j.
Each buyer"s ceiling is computed by removing the buyer"s matched seller and calculating the difference between the total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded and the total gain from trade of the other participants when the 3 buyer is included.
Since the optimal gain from trade which includes j is higher than that which does not, we have that the utility is nonnegative: vj(i) − Hj ≥ 0.
Computing T∗ involves solving the maximum weighted  bipartite matching problem for the complete bipartite graph Kn,m constructed by placing the buyers on one side of the Find the optimal allocation T ∗ Compute the maximum weighted bipartite matching for the bipartite graph of buyers and sellers, and edge weights equal to the gain from trade.
Let B1 be the buyer matched to S1 in (T−i −j )∗ , S2 be the seller matched to B1 in ( ˆT−k )∗ , B2 be the buyer matched to S2 in (T−i −j )∗ , and so on.
Finally, the following claim ensures that a buyer cannot influence the floor bound of the ZOPA for the good he wins.
This fact simply follows from the observation that reducing the seller"s  valuation increases the gain from trade for the current allocation by at least as much than any other allocation, whereas  increasing the seller"s valuation decreases the gain from trade for the current allocation by exactly the same amount as any other allocation in which it is matched.
Next, the mechanism computes for each buyer-seller pair a buyer ceiling, which provides the upper bound of the ZOPA for this pair, and assigns it to the buyer.
It follows that in order to prove (8) we need to show ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ + ˆvj(k) − vj(k).
Assign color 1 to the edges in the matching (T −i )∗ and assign color 2 to the edges in the matching (T−j)∗ .
Let G be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side of G represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side represent the sellers, and edge weights represent the gain from trade for the particular pair.
We begin with the incentive compatibility for buyers.
Since ( ˆV −i −j )∗ = (V −i −j )∗ and ( ˆV −i )∗ = (V −i )∗ it follows that ˆHj = vj(i)+( ˆV −i −j )∗ −( ˆV −i )∗ = vj(i)+(V −i −j )∗ −(V −i )∗ = Hj.

The different allocations represent bipartite matchings in G. It will be convenient for the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific color representing this matching.
Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ , and ˆLi = ˆvj(i) + ( ˆV−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ = ˆvj(i) + (V−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ .
MECHANISM (ZOPAS) 3.1 Description of the Mechanism ZOPAS is a negotiation-range mechanism, it finds the  optimal allocation T∗ and uses it to define a ZOPA for each buyer-seller pair.
Her utility surplus is at least Li − ci.
This means that its payment structure enforces that truth-telling is the players" weakly dominant strategy, that is that the  strategy by which the player is stating his true valuation results 4 ... jS1 S2 B1 S3 B2 B3S4 S5 B4 S6 B5 S8 B7 S7 B6 ...
Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, seller k = i is matched with j and the negotiation-range assigned is (ˆLk, ˆHj).
Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆvj, the matching between i and j remains unchanged and let the assigned bottom of the  negotiation range (seller"s floor) be ˆLi.
Let i be a seller matched to buyer j in T ∗ , and assume that ˆT∗ = T∗ , then ˆHj = Hj.
In particular, it is not possible for seller i who is matched in T ∗ to change her buyer by reporting a false valuation.
This means that the sum of values of these new allocations is at most (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ , which proves (10).
Now, since i is matched in ˆT∗ , using this allocation according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ + ˆci − ci ≤ U ≤ V ∗ .
Therefore we need to show that ˆV ∗ = V ∗ + ˆvj(i) − vj(i).
We also require that one of the new allocations does not include buyer j or seller i.
We also require that one of the new allocations does not include seller i and is based on the true valuation v, while the other allocation does not include buyer j or seller k and is based on the false valuation ˆv.
Since j is not allocated in T∗ then (V−j)∗ = V ∗ .
The seller floor for player i who was matched with buyer j on good Ai, i.e., Tj(Ai) = 1, is computed as: Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ .
Now, consider the seller i.
The following claim shows that a buyer j which changed his allocation due to a false declaration of his valuation cannot improve his top utility.
Therefore, the only case the optimal allocation may change is when in the new allocation i is not matched in which case her utility surplus is 0.
Since except for the first edge, all others do not involve i or j and thus may be colored 4 and be part of an allocation (T −i −j ) .
Buyer Ceiling: The highest price the seller should expect to pay, communicated to the buyer by the  mechanism.
(10) It is easy to see that (10) indeed implies (9) since it follows from the fact that k is assigned to j in ˆT∗ that ˆvj(k) ≥ vj(k).
Assign color 1 to the edges in the matching ( ˆT−k )∗ and assign color 2 to the edges in the matching (T −i −j )∗ .
The next step is to compute for each buyer-seller pair a seller"s floor, which provides the lower bound of the ZOPA for this pair, and assigns it to the seller.
Let B1 be the buyer matched to S1 in (T−j)∗ , S2 be the seller matched to B1 in (T−i )∗ , B2 be the buyer matched to S2 in (T−j)∗ , and so on.
A seller"s floor is computed by calculating the difference between the total gain from trade when the buyer is excluded and the total gain from trade of the other participants when the buyer is included (the VCG principle).
We are left to recolor the edges that do not belong to P. Since none of these edges includes j we have that the edges 6 that were colored 1, which are part of ( ˆT−k )∗ , may now be colored 4, and be included in the allocation ( ˆT−k −j ) .
In fact, in this case we prove the stronger inequality ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ ≤ (V −i )∗ + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ .
Let G be the bipartite graph where the nodes on one side of G represent the buyers and the nodes on the other side represent the sellers, and edge weights represent the gain from trade for the particular pair.
The different allocations represent bipartite matchings in G. It will be convenient for the sake of our argument to think of the edges that belong to each of the matchings as being colored with a specific color representing this matching.
Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ , and ˆLk = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ = ˆvj(k) + (V−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ .
This completes the analysis of the buyer"s incentive  compatibility.
(5) Notice that the first inequality of (4) always holds for a valid negotiation range mechanism (Lemma 1).
This means that the sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the original pair of allocations.
Consider a pair of buyer j and seller i which are matched in the optimal allocation T ∗ .
Buyer"s incentive compatibility: • Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the  mechanism according to valuation vj and the  negotiationrange assigned is (Li, Hj).
This path ends either in a seller who is not matched in (T −i −j )∗ or in a buyer who is not matched in ( ˆT−k )∗ .
Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗ , and k = i be the seller matched to j in ˆT∗ .
Then, vj(i) − Hj ≥ vj(k) − ˆHj.
Since j is allocated Ai in T∗ , we have that using the  allocation of T∗ according to the false valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying V ∗ − vj(i) + ˆvj(i) ≤ U ≤ ˆV ∗ .
Finally, the following simple claim ensures that a seller cannot influence the ceiling bound of the ZOPA for the good she sells.
Since i is not matched in T ∗ and ( ˆT−i )∗ involves only true valuations we have that ( ˆV −i )∗ = V ∗ .
The following claim shows that a buyer j which changed his allocation due to a false declaration of his valuation  cannot improve his bottom utility.
Thus, we have that ˆHz = ˆV ∗ + ˆci − V ∗ .
• ˆvj(k) = vj(k) and ˆvj(i) < vj(i): In this case (12) reduces to V ∗ ≥ ˆV ∗ .
Recall that Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ , so that vj(i) − Hj = (V −i )∗ − (V −i −j )∗ .
It is also clear that the edges that were colored 2, which are part of (T−j)∗ , may now be colored 3, and be included in the allocation T .
Seller Floor: The lowest price the seller should expect to receive, communicated to the seller by the mechanism.
Assume that when the mechanism 5 is applied according to valuation ˆci, buyer z = j is matched with i and the negotiation-range assigned is (ˆLi, ˆHz).
This means that the sum of values of the new allocations is the same as the  original pair of allocations.
Therefore, vj(i) − Li = V ∗ − (V−j)∗ and vj(k) − ˆLk = vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ − (V−j)∗ .
Let (T−i −j )∗ denote the gain from trade of the optimal  allocation when seller i is removed from the trade and buyer j"s bids are discarded.
The following claim shows that doing this is not beneficial to him.
Therefore we slightly relax it as follows: we require this holds when the false valuation based strategy changes the player"s allocation.
Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗ , and let k = i be the seller matched to j in ˆT∗ .
We now turn to prove the seller"s incentive  compatibility properties of our mechanism.
This path ends either in a seller who is not matched in (T−j)∗ or in a buyer who is not matched in (T−i )∗ .
Once the negotiation range lower bound and upper bound are computed for every matched pair, the mechanism reports the lower bound price to the seller and the upper bound price to the buyer.
Since j is allocated Ak in ˆT∗ we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ .
We start with the  allocations (T−i )∗ and (T−j)∗ which together have value equal to (V −i )∗ + (V−j)∗ .
Since S1 = i, we may use color 3 for the first edge and thus assign it to the allocation (T−i ) .
We claim that these edges can be recolored using colors 3 and 4 so that the new coloring represents allocations (T −i ) (represented by color 3) and ( ˆT−k −j ) (represented by color 4).
Then vj(i) − Hj ≥ vj(k) − ˆHj.
It follows that ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −i −z )∗ + vz(i) − ˆci.
(3) • Let j be a buyer not matched by the mechanism  according to valuation vj.
For a seller it"s the other way around.
Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ and Hj = vj(i)+(V −i −j )∗ −(V −i )∗ .
Thus we need to show that 0 ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ − (V−j)∗ .
All other edges, do not involve i, j or k and thus may be either colored 4 and be part of an allocation ( ˆT−k −j ) or colored 3 and be part of an allocation (T−i ) , in an alternating fashion.
Negotiation-range mechanisms assign bounds on the range of prices rather than the final price and therefore the player"s valuation only influences the minimum and maximum bounds on his utility.
(4) • Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the  mechanism according to valuation vj and let the assigned bottom of the negotiation range (seller"s floor) be Li.
Let i be a seller not matched in T ∗ , and assume buyer z is matched to i in ˆT∗ .
Another case in which a buyer may try to improve his utility is when he does not win any good by stating his true valuation.
Consider these two cases: • ˆvj(k) > vj(k): Since Ak was allocated to j in the allocation ˆT∗ we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(k) + vj(k) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ .
This results in a matching between buyers and sellers that maximizes gain from trade.
Denote by (V −i −j )∗ the total gain from trade in the allocation (T −i −j )∗ .
Let us show it satisfies the rest of the properties in the  theorem.
When the allocation stays unchanged we require instead that the player would not be able to change his matched player"s bound (e.g.
From the optimality of T ∗ we conclude that V ∗ ≥ ˆV ∗ .
ZOPAS is individually rational, i.e., the  mechanism maintains nonnegative utility surplus for all  participants.
(6) • Let i be a buyer matched with buyer j by the  mechanism according to valuation ci and let the assigned top of the negotiation range (buyer"s ceiling) be Hj.
Let (T−j)∗ denote the gain from trade of the optimal  allocation when buyer j"s bids are discarded.
Let j be a buyer matched to seller i in T ∗ , and assume that ˆT∗ = T∗ , then ˆLi = Li.
Recall that Hj = vj(i) + (V −i −j )∗ − (V −i )∗ and ˆHj = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV −k −j )∗ − ( ˆV −k )∗ .
It is also clear that the edges that were colored 2, which are part of (T−i −j )∗ , may now be colored 3, and be included in the allocation (T−i ) .
Then, vj(i) − Li ≥ vj(k) − ˆLk.
For a buyer the minimum (bottom) utility would be based on the top of the negotiation range  (ceiling), and the maximum (top) utility would be based on the bottom of the negotiation range (floor).
We claim that these edges can be recolored using colors 3 and 4 so that the new coloring represents allocations T (represented by color 3) and (T−i −j ) (represented by color 4).
This implies the that inequality (1) holds.
This implies that (V−j)∗ ≥ V ∗ − vj(i) + ci, which implies that Li − ci ≥ 0.
We now use them to create a pair of new valid allocations, by using the same pairs that were matched in the original allocations.
If a participant does not trade in the optimal allocation then his utility surplus is zero by definition.
We start with the allocations ( ˆT−k )∗ and (T−i −j )∗ which together have value equal to ( ˆV −k )∗ + (V −i −j )∗ .
For every buyer j- seller i pair matched by the mechanism: Li ≤ Hj.
Assume that when the mechanism is applied according to valuation ˆci, the matching between i and j remains unchanged and let the assigned top of the negotiation range (buyer"s ceiling) be ˆHj.
Therefore the basic natural requirement from negotiation-range mechanisms would be that stating the player"s true valuation results in both the higher  bottom utility and higher top utility for the player, compared with other strategies.
Therefore, vj(i) − Hj = (V −i )∗ − (V −i −j )∗ and vj(k) − ˆHj = vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV −k )∗ − ( ˆV −k −j )∗ .
Let S1 be the seller matched to j in (T −i )∗ (if none exists then P is empty).
At this point each buyer-seller pair negotiates on the final price and concludes the deal.
Recall that ˆHz = vz(i) + ( ˆV −i −z )∗ − ( ˆV −i )∗ .
Thus we can conclude that 0 ≥ vj(k) − ˆvj(k) + ˆV ∗ − (V−j)∗ .
Since j is not allocated i in ˆT∗ we have that ˆT∗ is an allocation that uses only true valuations.
This implies the that inequality (10) holds.
We now use them to create a pair of new valid allocations, by using the same pairs that were matched in the original allocations.
Then, vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0.
Let (T−i )∗ denote the gain from trade of the optimal allocation when seller i is removed from the trade.
To prove that Li ≤ Hj it is enough to show that (V −i )∗ + (V−j)∗ ≤ V ∗ + (V −i −j )∗ .
This defines an alternating path P, starting at j, whose edges" colors alternate between colors 1 and 2 (starting with 1).
Let S1 = i be the seller matched to j in ( ˆT−k )∗ (if none exists then P is empty).
The buyer is instructed not to pay more than this price to his matched seller.
This means that the only thing he can influence is his own bound, something that he can alternatively achieve through means of negotiation.
Recall that Li = vj(i) + (V−j)∗ − V ∗ .
Adding up these two inequalities implies (9) in this case.
The ZOPAS market negotiation-range  mechanism is an incentive-compatible bilateral trade  mechanism that is efficient, individually rational and budget balanced.
Since i is matched with z in ˆT∗ it can be obtained by adding the buyer z - seller i pair to ( ˆT−i −z)∗ .
This ensures that they can close the deal at a final price which lies in this range.
(2) vj(i) − Li ≥ vj(k) − ˆLk.
This defines an alternating path P, starting at j, whose edges" colors alternate between colors 1 and 2 (starting with 1).
Observe that in the case of sellers in our setting, the case expressed by requirement (6) is the only case in which the seller may change the allocation to her benefit.
Seller"s incentive compatibility: • Let i be a seller not matched by the mechanism  according to valuation ci.
Recall that ˆLk = ˆvj(k) + ( ˆV−j)∗ − ˆV ∗ .
Define an alternating path P starting at j.
The following formally summarizes our incentive  compatibility requirements from the negotiation-range mechanism.
(12) The scenario of this claim occurs when j understates his value for Ai or overstated his value for Ak.
Denote by (V−j)∗ the total gain from trade in the allocation (T−j)∗ .
Then vj(k) − ˆHj ≤ vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0.
Define an alternating path P starting at j.
The seller is instructed not to accept less than this price from her matched buyer.
Therefore ˆHz −ci = ˆV ∗ +ˆci −V ∗ −ci ≤ 0.
Then the buyer"s utility is at least vj(i) − Hj.
The first stage in applying the mechanism is for the buyers and sellers to submit their sealed bids.
Then, ˆHz − ci ≤ 0.
This completes the proof of (10) and the claim.
Finally, buyers and sellers use the ZOPA to negotiate a final price.
ZOPAS is an incentive compatible  negotiationrange mechanism.
The  maximum weighted matching problem in solvable in polynomial time (e.g., using the Hungarian Method).
Claim 2.
Then ˆLi − ci ≤ ˆHz − ci ≤ 0.
a buyer cannot change the seller"s floor).
Claim 1.
3.3 Incentive Compatibility The basic requirement in mechanism design is for an  exchange mechanism to be incentive compatible.
Unfortunately, this requirement is still too strong and it is impossible (by [10]) that this will always hold.
The  utility surplus is defined as the absolute difference between the player"s bid and his price.
Claim 3.
He may give a false valuation under which he wins some good.
This completes the proof of the lemma.
Claim 5.
Figure 2 illustrates the graph G and the colorings of the different matchings.
3.2 Analysis of the Mechanism In this section we analyze the properties of the ZOPAS mechanism.
