In this paper we suggest a way to deal with the  impossibility of producing mechanisms which are efficient,  individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced.
Are there different market models and requirements from the mechanisms that are more feasible than classic mechanism design goals ?
The ZOPA produced by our mechanism is based 7 on a natural adaptation of the VCG payment scheme in a way that promises valid negotiation ranges which permit a budget balanced allocation.
The basic question that we aimed to tackle seems very exciting: which properties can we expect a market  mechanism to achieve ?
In the context of our negotiation-range model, is  natural to further study negotiation based mechanisms in more general settings.
The goal of the mechanism is to provide the  initial range (ZOPA) for negotiation in a way that it will be beneficial for the participants to close the proposed deals.
Applying the approach in this paper to develop  negotiationrange mechanisms for combinatorial markets, even in  restricted settings, seems a promising direction for research. 
We present a negotiation range mechanism that is efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget  balanced.
To this aim we introduce the concept of negotiation-range mechanisms which avoid the problem by leaving the final determination of prices to a negotiation between the buyer and seller.
A natural extension is that of a  combinatorial market.
Unfortunately, finding the optimal allocation in a combinatorial setting is NP-hard, and thus the problem of maintaining BB is compounded by the problem of  maintaining IC when efficiency is approximated [1, 5, 6, 9, 11].
