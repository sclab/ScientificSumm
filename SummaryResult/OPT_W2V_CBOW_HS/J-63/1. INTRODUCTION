In designing a mechanism to compute trades and payments we must consider the bidding strategies of self-interested players, i.e.
Myerson-Satterthwaite"s proof relies on a theorem assuring that in two different efficient IC markets; if the sellers have the same upper bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market and if the buyers have the same lower bound utility then they will receive the same prices in each market.
The market"s main  objective is to produce an allocation of sellers" goods to buyers as to maximize the total gain from trade.
The philosophy of the VCG payment schemes in bilateral trade is that the buyer pays the seller"s  opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not keeping the good to herself.
This means that the only thing that he may achieve by reporting a false valuation is modifying his own negotiation bound, something that he could alternatively achieve by reporting his true valuation and incorporating the effect of the  modified negotiation bound into his negotiation strategy.
In addition we require individual rationality (IR) so that all players have positive expected utility to participate, budget balance (BB) so that the exchange does not run at a loss, and incentive compatibility (IC) so that reporting the truth is a dominant strategy for each player.
1 We focus on the single-unit heterogeneous setting: n  sellers offer one unique good each by placing sealed bids  specifying their willingness to sell, and m buyers, interested in buying a single good each, placing sealed bids specifying their willingness to pay for each good they may be  interested in.
The  algorithm motivates players to participate truthfully by handing payments to them.
This result designs both a regular and a combinatorial bilateral trade mechanism (which imposes BB and IR) that approximates truth revelation and allocation efficiency.
The problem of computing the optimal allocation which maximizes gain from trade can be conceptualized as the problem of finding the maximum weighted matching in a weighted bipartite graph connecting buyers and sellers, where each edge in the graph is assigned a weight equal to the  difference between the respective buyer bid and seller bid.
In this paper we circumvent Myerson and Satterthwaite"s impossibility result by introducing a new model of  negotiationrange markets.
More specifically, in a negotiation-range mechanism, the range of prices each matched pair is given is resolved by a negotiation stage where a final price is determined.
The mechanism in an exchange collects buyer bids and seller bids and clears the exchange by computing:(i) a set of trades, and (ii) the payments made and received by players.
We show that if the above utility maximizing condition does not hold then it is the case that the player cannot influence the negotiation bound that is assigned to his deal partner no matter what value he declares.
The seller is paid in addition to the buyer"s price a compensation for the damage the  mechanism did to the seller by not extracting the buyer"s full bid.
Our main result is a single-unit heterogeneous bilateral trade negotiation-range mechanism (ZOPAS) that is  efficient, individually rational, incentive compatible and budget balanced.
In our market mechanism the seller"s upper bound utility may be the same while the seller"s floor is different and the buyer"s lower bound utility may be the same while the buyer"s ceiling is different.
That is the mechanism must compute a set of trades that maximizes gain from trade.
Our philosophy is a bit different: The seller is paid at least her opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not keeping the good for herself.
Our single-unit heterogeneous mechanism bypasses Myerson and  Satterthwaite"s theorem by producing a price range, defined by a seller"s floor and a buyer"s ceiling, for each pair of matched players.
In this paper we introduce the concept of negotiation based mechanisms in the context of the theory of efficient truthful markets.
In effect a negotiation-range mechanism operates as a mediator between the market participants, offering them the grounds to be able to finalize the terms of the trade by themselves.
The buyer pays at most his alternate seller"s opportunity cost of not selling the good to another buyer and not keeping the alternate good for herself.
This negotiation stage is crucial for our mechanism to be IC.
This eliminates the benefit of reporting false valuations and  allows our mechanism to compute the optimal gain from trade according to the players" true values.
This allows the trading parties to engage in negotiation over the final price with guarantee that the deal is beneficial for both of them.
In section 3 we present the single-unit heterogeneous negotiation-range mechanism and show that it is efficient, IR, IC and BB.
Intuitively, a negotiation range mechanism is incentive  compatible if truth telling promises the best ZOPA from the point of view of the player in question.
The negotiation process is not considered part of the mechanism but left up to the  interested parties, or to some external mechanism to perform.
rational players that follow expected-utility maximizing strategies.
A negotiation-range mechanism does not produce payment prices for the market participants.
Our particular approach adapts the VCG payment scheme to achieve  budget balance.
Moreover, the final price is not fixed by the mechanism at all.
This is simply because such a mechanism could be easily modified to  determine final prices for the players (e.g.
A unique approach to  overcome Myerson and Satterthwaite"s impossibility result was attempted by Parkes, Kalagnanam and Eso [12].
Unfortunately, Myerson and Satterthwaite"s (1983) well known result demonstrates that in bilateral trade it is  impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, BB, and IR using an IC mechanism [10].
We set allocative efficiency as our primary goal.
Instead, it is determined by an independent negotiation between the buyer and seller.
That is, he would tell the truth if this strategy maximizes the upper and lower bounds on his utility as expressed by the ZOPA boundaries.
In this model each player has a private valuation function that assigns real values to each possible allocation.
Here, the negotiation stage come into play.
VCG IC payment schemes [2, 7, 13] support efficient and IR bilateral trade but not simultaneously BB.
A market consists of multiple buyers and sellers who wish to exchange goods.
A commonly studied model of participant behavior is taken from the field of economic mechanism design [3, 4, 11].
The buyer is provided with the high end of the range and the seller with the low end of the range.
This concept is natural to many real-world market  environments such as the real estate market.
Yet, when carefully examined it turns out that it is  impossible (by [10]) that this goal will always hold.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
It is well known that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time.
by taking the average of the range"s boundaries).
Our result does not contradict Myerson and  Satterthwaite"s important theorem.
Rather, is assigns each buyer-seller pair a price range, called Zone Of Possible Agreements (ZOPA).
Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Section 4. 
In  Section 2 we describe our model and definitions.
