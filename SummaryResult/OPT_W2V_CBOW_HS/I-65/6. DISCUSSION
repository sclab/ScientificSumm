We showed how DIDs may be extended to I-DIDs that enable online sequential decision-making in uncertain multiagent settings.
I-DIDs may be seen as concise graphical representations for  IPOMDPs providing a way to exploit problem structure and carry out online decision-making as the agent acts and observes given its prior beliefs.
work significantly by being more transparent, semantically clear, and capable of being solved using standard algorithms that target DIDs.
I-DIDs extend NIDs to allow sequential decision-making over multiple time steps in the presence of other interacting agents.
We are currently investigating ways to solve I-DIDs approximately with provable bounds on the solution quality.

Our graphical representation of I-DIDs improves on the previous Figure 12: A level 1 agent i"s three step policy in the Poker problem.
i starts by believing that j is equally likely to be aggressive or  conservative and could have any card in its hand with equal probability.
