Many of these attributes have scalar values, so one natural way to query events of interest is to use a  multidimensional range query.
Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable  assumptions about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well with network size (both insertion and query costs scale as O( √ N)).
Our distributed index for multi-dimensional data (or DIM) uses a novel geographic embedding of a classical index data structure, and is built upon the GPSR geographic routing algorithm.
In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are  sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, even for moderately sized network.
In many sensor networks, data or events are named by  attributes.
In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed  index that scalably supports multi-dimensional range queries.
Such queries are useful for correlating events occurring within the network.
An example is: List all events whose temperature lies between 50◦ and 60◦ , and whose light levels lie between 10 and 15.

Finally, experiments on a small scale testbed validate the feasibility of DIMs.
