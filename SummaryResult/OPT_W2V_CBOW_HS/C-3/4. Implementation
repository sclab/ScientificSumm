The adaptation coordinator uses the Registry to discover the application processes, and the application processes use this service to discover each other.
The  coordinator is implemented as a separate process.
In the future, we are planning to integrate our adaptation component with GAT (3) which is becoming a  standard in the grid community and KOALA (15) a scheduler that  provides co-allocation on top of standard grid middleware, such as the Globus Toolkit (11). 
With Satin, the programmer annotates the sequential code with divide-and-conquer primitives and compiles the annotated code with a special Satin compiler that generates the necessary communication and load balancing code.
The Registry provides, among others, a membership service to the processors taking part in the computation.
The resulting system therefore is highly portable (due to Java"s write once, run anywhere property) allowing the software to run unmodified on a heterogeneous grid.
Zorilla provides locality-aware scheduling, which tries to allocate processors that are located close to each other in terms of communication latency.
We instrumented the Satin runtime system to collect runtime statistics and send them to the adaptation coordinator.
For requesting new nodes, the Zorilla (9) system is used - a peer-to-peer supercomputing middleware which allows  straightforward allocation of processors in multiple clusters and/or  supercomputers.
Finally, the Registry provides the possibility to send signals to application processes.
The coordinator uses this functionality to notify the processors that they need to leave the computation.
The Registry also offers fault detection (additional to the fault detection provided by the  communication channels).
Currently the Registry is implemented as a  centralized server.
Satin uses a very  efficient, grid-aware load balancing algorithm - Cluster-aware  Random Work Stealing (CRS) (19), which hides wide-area latencies by overlapping local and remote stealing.
Both coordinator and Satin are implemented entirely in Java on top of the Ibis  communication library (21).
In the future, Zorilla will also support bandwidth-aware scheduling, which tries to maximize the total bandwidth in the system.
Zorilla can be easily replaced with  another grid scheduler.
We incorporated our adaptation mechanism into Satin - a Java framework for creating grid-enabled divide-and-conquer  applications.
Ibis also provides the Ibis Registry.
The core of Ibis is also implemented in Java.
Satin also provides  transparent fault tolerance and malleability (23).
With Satin, removing and adding processors from/to an ongoing computation incurs little overhead.
