In this way, norms, contracts, and information chunks will be represented as instances of Commit(·) where α and β can be individual agents or  institutions.
Contracts signed by agents and  information passed by agents, are similar to norms in the sense that they oblige agents to behave in a particular way, so as to satisfy the conditions of the contract, or to make the world consistent with the information passed.
≤ is a reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric relation on C (a partial order) 4. σ : R → C+ is the function assigning to each relation symbol its arity 1 In its purest form, individuals in these societies collect food and consume it when and where it is found.
platypus is a mammal, Australian-dollar is a currency), and a set of relations over these concepts (e.g.
α"s communication language has two fundamental  primitives: Commit(α, β, ϕ) to represent, in ϕ, the world that α aims at bringing about and that β has the right to verify, complain about or claim compensation for any deviations from, and Done(μ) to represent the event that a certain action μ4 has taken place.
A measure [10] bases the semantic similarity  between two concepts on the path length induced by ≤ (more distance in the ≤ graph means less semantic similarity), and the depth of the subsumer concept (common ancestor) in the shortest path between the two concepts (the deeper in the hierarchy, the closer the meaning of the concepts).
C is: μ ::= illoc(α, β, ϕ, t) | μ; μ | Let context In μ End ϕ ::= term | Done(μ) | Commit(α, β, ϕ) | ϕ ∧ ϕ | ϕ ∨ ϕ | ¬ϕ | ∀v.ϕv | ∃v.ϕv context ::= ϕ | id = ϕ | prolog clause | context; context where ϕv is a formula with free variable v, illoc is any  appropriate set of illocutionary particles, ‘;" means sequencing, and context represents either previous agreements, previous illocutions, the ontological working context, that is a  projection of the ontological trees that represent the focus of the conversation, or code that aligns the ontological  differences between the speakers needed to interpret an action a.
A contract δ = (a, b) between agents α and β is a pair where a and b represent the actions that agents α and β are responsible for respectively.
3.1 Ontology In order to define a language to structure agent dialogues we need an ontology that includes a (minimum) repertoire of  elements: a set of concepts (e.g.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1031 Element A new trading partner my butcher my boss my partner my children Legitimacy equity equity equity equality need Options equity equity equity mixeda need Goals equity need equity need need Independence equity equity equality need need Commitment equity equity equity mixed need a equity on burden, equality on good Table 1: Some desired balances (sense of fairness) examples depending on the relationship.
R contains  relations between the concepts in the hierarchy, this is needed to define ‘objects" (e.g.
Representing an ontology as a set predicates in Prolog is simple.
How signed contracts, Commit(·), about objects in a particular semantic region, and their execution, Done(·), affect our decision making process about signing future contracts in nearby semantic regions is crucial to modelling the common sense that human beings apply in managing trading  relationships.
number of hops) of the  shortest path between the concepts, h is the depth of the deepest concept subsuming both concepts, and κ1 and κ2 are  parameters scaling the contributions of the shortest path length and the depth respectively.
The set term contains instances of the ontology concepts and relations.5 For example, we can represent the following offer: If you spend a total of more than e100 in my shop during  October then I will give you a 10% discount on all goods in November, as: Offer( α, β,spent(β, α, October, X) ∧ X ≥ e100 → ∀ y.
The semantic distance between concepts within an  ontology depends on how far away they are in the structure defined by the ≤ relation.
3 Usually, a set of axioms defined over the concepts and  relations is also required.
To simplify  computations in the computing of probability distributions we assume that there is a number of disjoint is-a trees covering different ontological spaces (e.g.
3.2 Language The shape of the language that α uses to represent the  information received and the content of its dialogues depends on two fundamental notions.
, cn) implicitly determines that ci is an instance of the concept in the i-th position of the relation r. 1032 The Sixth Intl.
deals) that are defined as a tuple of issues.
The set of norms affecting the behaviour of an agent defines the context that the agent has to take into account.
Done(Inform(ξ, α, pay(β, α, y), November)) → Commit(α, β, discount(y,10%))) ξ is an institution agent that reports the payment.
C is a finite set of concept symbols (including basic data types); 2.
Thus, an agent has to abide by a norm while it is inside an institution, a contract has a validity period, and a piece of information is true only during an interval in time.
2 In these societies there are family units, around a shelter, that represent the basic food sharing structure.
Contracts and  Information can thus be thought of as normative statements that restrict an agent"s behaviour.
price(beer,AUD)).3 We model  ontologies following an algebraic approach [8] as: An ontology is a tuple O = (C, R, ≤, σ) where: 1.
Then the food intake depends more on the need of the members.
Second, the dialogues in which α engages are built around two fundamental actions: (i) passing information, and (ii) exchanging proposals and contracts.
The Sixth Intl.
First, when agents interact within an overarching institution they explicitly or implicitly accept the norms that will constrain their behaviour, and accept the established sanctions and penalties whenever norms are violated.
5 We assume the convention that C(c) means that c is an instance of concept C and r(c1, .
a tree for types of fabric, a tree for shapes of clothing, and so on).
Semantic similarity is then defined as: Sim(c, c ) = e−κ1l · eκ2h − e−κ2h eκ2h + e−κ2h where l is the length (i.e.
R is a finite set of relation symbols; 3.
Norms, contracts, and information have an obvious  temporal dimension.
4 Without loss of generality we will assume that all actions are dialogical.
This is a pure equity sharing of the resources, the gain is proportional to the effort.
Semantic distance plays a  fundamental role in strategies for information-based agency.
Usually, food is accumulated at the shelter for future use.
