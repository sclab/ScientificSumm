A relationship strategy maintains a target intimacy for each relationship that an agent would like the relationship to move towards in future.
The intimacy is a pair of matrices that  evaluate both an agent"s contribution to the relationship and its opponent"s contribution each from an information view and from a utilitarian view across the five LOGIC  dimensions.
We introduce a  negotiation model based on these dimensions and on two primitive concepts: intimacy (degree of closeness) and balance (degree of fairness).
The negotiation strategy maintains a set of Options that are in-line with the current intimacy level, and then tactics wrap the Options in argumentation with the aim of attaining a successful deal and  manipulating the successive negotiation balances towards the target intimacy.
Successful negotiators prepare by determining their position along five dimensions: Legitimacy, Options, Goals,  Independence, and Commitment, (LOGIC).
The balance is the difference between these  matrices.
