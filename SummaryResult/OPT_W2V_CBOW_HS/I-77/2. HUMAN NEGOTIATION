We believe that the perception of balance in dialogues (in negotiation or otherwise) is grounded on social relationships, and that every dimension of an interaction between humans can be correlated to the social closeness, or intimacy,  between the parties involved.
The perceived balance in a negotiation dialogue allows  negotiators to infer information about their opponent, about its LOGIC stance, and to compare their relationships with all negotiators.
For instance, if we perceive that every time we request information it is provided, and that no significant questions are returned, or no complaints about not  receiving information are given, then that probably means that our opponent perceives our social relationship to be very close.
Also, several utterances can have a  utilitarian interpretation in the sense that an agent can associate a preferential gain to them.
For instance, an offer may  inform our negotiation opponent about our willingness to sign a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, and at the same time the opponent can compute what is its associated expected utilitarian gain.
The perception of a relation being in balance (i.e.
The  classical view [1] is that people perceive resource allocations as being distributively fair (i.e.
messages, with the intention of getting  information about the opponent or giving away information about us along these five dimensions: request for  information, propose options, inform about interests, issue promises, appeal to standards .
A key part of any negotiation process is to build a model of our opponent(s) along these  dimensions.
All utterances agents make during a negotiation give away information about their current LOGIC model, that is, about their legitimacy, options, goals, independence, and commitments.
For instance, if we are in a purely economic setting (low intimacy) we might request equity for the Options dimension but could accept equality in the Goals dimension.
What are the persuasive arguments about the fairness of the options?
friends), equality is perceived as more fair; and in situations where personal development or personal welfare are the goal (e.g.
In this context, we can clearly see that, for instance,  families exchange not only goods but also information and  knowledge based on need, and that few families would consider their relationships as being unbalanced, and thus unfair, when there is a strong asymmetry in the exchanges (a mother explaining everything to her children, or buying toys, does not expect reciprocity).
Before a negotiation starts human negotiators prepare the dialogic exchanges that can be made along the five LOGIC dimensions [7]: • Legitimacy.
Alternatively, we can detect what issues are causing a burden to our opponent by observing an imbalance in the information or utilitarian senses on that issue. 
What information is relevant to the  negotiation process?
two friends eat the same amount of a cake cooked by one of them), and need being the allocation proportional to the need for the resource (e.g.
According to the previous  studies, the more intimacy across the five LOGIC dimensions the more the need norm is used, and the less intimacy the more the equity norm is used.
Negotiation dialogues, in this context, exchange  dialogical moves, i.e.
In the case of partners there is some evidence [3] that the allocations of goods and burdens (i.e.
What are the possible agreements we can accept?
In purely  economical relationships (e.g., business), equity is perceived as more fair; in relations where joint action or fostering of social relationships are the goal (e.g.
positive and negative utilities) are perceived as fair, or in balance, based on equity for burdens and equality for goods.
What are the underlying things we need or care about?
However, more recent studies [16, 17] show that humans follow a richer set of norms of distributive justice depending on their intimacy level: equity, equality, and need.
