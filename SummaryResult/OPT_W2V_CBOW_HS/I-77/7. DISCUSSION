The current Balance and intimacy levels and the desired, or target, levels are used by the tactics to determine what to say next.
It introduces the concepts of intimacy and balance as key  elements in understanding what is a negotiation strategy and tactic.

We are currently exploring the use of this model as an extension of a currently widespread eProcurement  software commercialised by iSOCO, a spin-off company of the laboratory of one of the authors.
Negotiation is understood as a dialogue that affect five basic dimensions: Legitimacy, Options, Goals,  Independence, and Commitment.
Each dialogical move produces a change in a 2×5 matrix that evaluates the dialogue along five information-based measures and five utility-based measures.
In this paper we have introduced a novel approach to  negotiation that uses information and game-theoretical  measures grounded on business and psychological studies.
