When we are looking at the dominance relations for player i, the other players (−i) can be thought of as a single player.3  Therefore, in the rest of the paper, when we study one-shot (not iterated) dominance, we will focus without loss of generality on two-player games.4 In two-player games, we will  generally refer to the players as r (row) and c (column) rather than 1 and 2.
Thus, removing the mixed strategy σj does not introduce any new dominances.
Player i"s strategy σi is said to be strictly dominated by player i"s strategy σi if for any vector of  strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) > ui(σi, σ−i).
σr may originally not dominate σr because the latter performs better against σc; but then, once σc is removed because it is dominated by σc, σr dominates σr, and the latter can be removed.
, n}; and, for each player i, a (finite) set of pure strategies Σi and a utility function ui : Σ1 × Σ2 × .
In this definition, it is sometimes allowed for the  dominating strategy σi to be a mixed strategy, that is, a probability distribution over pure strategies.
Iterated dominance can eliminate more strategies than dominance, as follows.
We note that the process of iterated dominance is never helped by removing a dominated mixed strategy, for the following reason.
For  example, in the following game, R can be removed first, after which D is dominated.
The two main notions of dominance are defined as follows.
Player i"s strategy σi is said to be weakly dominated by player i"s strategy σi if for any vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) ≥ ui(σi, σ−i), and for at least one vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) > ui(σi, σ−i).
, σn) denotes player i"s utility when each player j plays action σj).
In this section, we briefly review normal form games, as well as dominance and iterated dominance (both strict and weak).
If σi gives player i a higher utility than σi against mixed strategy σj for player j = i (and strategies σ−{i,j} for the other players), then for at least one pure strategy σj that σj places positive  probability on, σi must perform better than σi against σj (and strategies σ−{i,j} for the other players).
A normal form game is given by a set of players {1, 2, .
In iterated dominance, dominated strategies are removed from the game, and no longer have any effect on future  dominance relations.
the definition are the expected utilities.2 There are other  notions of dominance, such as very weak dominance (in which no strict inequality is required, so two strategies can  dominate each other), but we will not study them here.
In this case, the utilities in dominance altogether.
For example, simple dominance checks are sometimes used as a subroutine in searching for Nash equilibria [21].

An n-player normal form game is defined as follows.
We are now ready to move on to the core of this paper.
