The first of these guidelines underscores the importance of displaying query terms in context: Whenever possible all of the query terms should appear in the caption, reflecting their relationship to the associated page.
A second guideline speaks to the desirability of  presenting the user with a readable snippet: When query terms are present in the title, they need not be repeated in the  snippet.
While our results do not direct address all of the many variables that influence users understanding of captions, they are consistent with the major guidelines.
Most surprising to us is the negative influence of the terms: encyclopedia, wikipedia, free, and medlineplus.
As an additional experiment, we treated each of the terms appearing in the INV and CON sets as a separate feature (case normalized), ranking them by their χ2 values.
While this outcome may not be  surprising, we are aware of no other work that can provide  support for claims of this type in the context of a commercial Web search engine.
The influence of the Official and Image features led us to wonder what other terms are prevalent in the captions of clickthrough inversions.
In other words, URLs should be selected and displayed in a manner that emphasizes their relationship to the query.
The results for TermMatchTitle and TermMatchTSU confirm that matching more terms is  desirable.

When titles are available from multiple sources -the header, the body, Web directories - a caption generation algorithm might a select a combination of title, snippet and URL that includes as many of the query terms as possible.
The final column of the table indicates the direction of the influence, whether the presence of the terms positively or negatively influence clickthroughs.
This work was originally motivated by our desire to  validate some simple guidelines for the generation of  captionssummarizing opinions that we formulated while working on related issues.
The high rank given to and may be related to readability (the term the appears in  position 20).
Other features provide additional indirect support for this guideline, and none of the results are inconsistent with it.
The positive influence of official has already been  observed (the difference in the χ2 value from that of figure 5 is due to stemming).
In particular, when a high-quality query-independent summary is available from an external source, such as a Web directory, it may be more appropriate to display this summary than a lower-quality query-dependent fragment  selected on-the-fly.
If a query term is  missing from a caption, the user may have no idea why the result was returned.
The results for the MatchAll feature directly support this guideline.
the shortest URL should be preferred, provided that all query terms will still appear in the caption.
The three URL features, as well as TermMatchTSU, directly support this guideline.
When query terms appear in the URL they should highlighted or otherwise distinguished.
Once again, other features provide indirect support, and none of the results are inconsistent with it.
Since we use the χ2 statistic as a divergence measure, rather than a significance test, no p-values are given.
More detailed analyses and further experiments will be required to understand these features. 
The results support claims that missing snippets, short snippets, missing query terms and complex URLs negatively impact clickthroughs.
The MatchAll and Readable features directly support this guideline.
When a title containing all query terms can be found, the algorithm might select a query-independent  snippet.
The first three terms appear in the title of Wikipedia articles3 and the last appears in the title of MedlinePlus articles4 .
Finally, the length and complexity of a URL influences user behavior.
Further work is needed to provide additional support for the guidelines and to understand the relationships among variables.
feature appear in the top ten, but pictures and photos appear at positions 21 and 22.
These individual word-level features provide hints about  issues.
When  multiple URLs reference the same page (due to re-directions, etc.)
The results are presented in figure 6.
