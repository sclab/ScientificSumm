But in the case of an informational query, the title and snippet may be necessary to guide the user in selecting a page for further study, and she may judge the relevance of a page on the basis of the caption alone.
The correct choice of snippet may depend on aspects of both the query and the result page.
The snippet of the first caption consists of a complete sentence that  concisely describes the associated page, while the snippet of the third caption consists of two incomplete sentences that are largely unrelated to the overall contents of the associated page and to the apparent intent of the query.
When these alternative snippets, titles and URLs are  available, the selection of an appropriate combination for display may be guided by their features.
Nonetheless, given the similarity of caption formats across the major Web search engines we believe the results are applicable to these other engines.
A principal motivation for providing a caption is to assist the user in determining the relevance of the associated page without actually having to click through to the result.
The major commercial Web search engines all present their results in much the same way.
All of the query terms appear in the URL of the third caption, while none appear in the URL of the first caption.
Understanding this influence may help to validate algorithms and guidelines for the improved generation of the Figure 1: Top three results for the query: kids online games.
Often the snippet is extracted from the Web page itself, but it may also be taken from external sources, such as the human-generated summaries found in Web directories.
Snippets may be generated in a query-independent fashion,  providing a summary of the page as a whole, or in a  querydependent fashion, providing a summary of how the page relates to the query terms.
Different caption generation algorithms might select  snippets of different lengths from different areas of a page.
The title of the third caption contains all of the query terms in order, while the titles of the first and second captions contain only two of the three terms.
Even worse, the user may be misled into skipping a page that contains desired  information.
In this paper, we examine the influence of caption  features on user"s Web search behavior, using clickthroughs extracted from search engines logs as our primary  investigative tool.
In the case of a navigational query - particularly when the destination is well known - the URL alone may be sufficient to identify the desired page.
In addition, we believe our methodology may be generalized to other search  applications when sufficient clickthrough data is available. 
The snippet of the third caption is nearly twice as long as that of the first, while the snippet is missing entirely from the second caption.
Unfortunately, these page characteristics are not entirely  reflected in the captions.
Moreover, for pages listed in human-edited Web directories such as the Open Directory Project1 , it may be possible to display alternative titles and snippets derived from these listings.
Each search result is described by a brief caption, comprising the URL of the  associated Web page, a title, and a brief summary (or  snippet) describing the contents of the page.
The experiments reported in later sections are based on  Windows Live query logs, result pages and relevance judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine  performance [1,2].
A URL before re-direction may be shorter and provide a clearer idea of the final destination.
The work reported in this paper was undertaken in the context of the Windows Live search engine.
When it fails, the user may waste her time clicking through to an inappropriate result and scanning a page containing little or nothing of interest.
A snippet from a Web  directory may consist of complete sentences and be less  fragmentary than an extracted snippet.
While the three captions share the same basic structure, their content differs in several respects.
While these differences may seem minor, they may also have a substantial impact on user behavior.
The third result might be somewhat disappointing to a user, since it leads to only a single game, hosted at the Centers for Disease Control, that could not reasonably be described as online.
A title extracted from the body may provide greater coverage of the query terms.
One of the query terms is repeated in the first caption.
When this judgment is correct, it can speed the search process by allowing the user to avoid unwanted material.
Figure 1 shows a typical Web search, with captions for the top three results.
The title may be taken from the HTML header or extracted from the body of the document [8].
homepage, but it is then necessary to follow a link in a menu to find the main page for games.
The query in 1 www.dmoz.org figure 1 produces results with similar relevance on the other major search engines.
The first result links to the main Yahoo Kids!
This and other queries produce  captions that exhibit similar variations.
For links that re-direct, it may be possible to display alternative URLs.
In addition, these features can play a role in the process of inferring relevance judgments from user behavior [1].
All three of the results in figure 1 are relevant, with some limitations.
The image in  figure 1 was captured from Windows Live and cropped to  eliminate branding, advertising and navigational elements.
By better understanding their influence, better judgments may result.
Despite appearances, the second result links to a surprisingly large collection of  online games, primarily with environmental themes.
