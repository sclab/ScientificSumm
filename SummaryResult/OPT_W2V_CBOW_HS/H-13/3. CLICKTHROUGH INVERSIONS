For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs.
By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to  capture a user"s impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.
Each record includes a query, a result position, a title, a snippet, a URL, the  number of clickthroughs for this result, and the total number of clickthroughs for this query.
We then processed this set to generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions.
Our primary tool for examining the influence of caption features is a type of pattern observed with respect to these caption pairs, which we call a clickthrough inversion.
In all of these cases, there were more clicks on the lower ranked member of the Relationship Number Percent rel(A) < rel(B) 119 33.5% rel(A) = rel(B) 134 37.7% rel(A) > rel(B) 102 28.7% Figure 3: Relevance relationships at clickthrough  inversions.
3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in  section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).
For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher  ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B.
For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US  English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g.
While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.

When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.
For example, for the third query (kids online games) the clickthrough curve  exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions, with an apparent preference for the result at position 4.
3.3 Relevance The simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough inversion is a relevance difference between the higher  ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member.
For  similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no  clickthroughs for that query were retained.
If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.
Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.
In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial  experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated  judgments created as part of on-going work.
As we see in the figure, relevance alone appears inadequate to explain the majority of clickthrough inversions.
Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded.
At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.
Compares relevance between the higher ranking member of a caption pair (rel(A)) to the  relevance of the lower ranking member (rel(B)), where caption A received fewer clicks than caption B. pair (B).
Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain  considerable noise.
Each caption would appropriately summarize the content of the linked page and its  relationship to the query, allowing users to make accurate  judgments.
For each example, we plot the percentage of  clickthroughs against position for the top ten results.
Several causes may be enlisted to explain the presence of an inversion in a clickthrough curve.
For example, the first row rel(A) < rel(B), indicates that the higher ranking member of pair (A) was rated as less relevant than the lower ranking member of the pair (B).
For  twothirds of the inversions (236), the page associated with  caption A is at least as relevant as the page associated with  caption B.
Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.
For both queries, the number of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions, with the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as position increases, the ideal behavior.
Even when the relative ranking is appropriate, a caption may fail to reflect the content of the underlying page with respect to the query, leading the user to make an incorrect judgment.
We consider caption pairs, which appear adjacent to one another in the result list.
For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing.
[9], we interpret a  clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.
Any preference captured by a clickthrough  inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.
In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.
Over a four-day  period, we sampled the search engine logs and extracted over one hundred thousand clicks involving these queries.
From these clicks we identified 355 clickthrough inversions,  satisfying the criteria of section 3.1, where relevance judgments existed for both pages.
A hypothetical perfect search engine would respond to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant first in the result list.
The outcome is presented in figure 3, which shows the explicit judgments for the 355 clickthrough inversions.
The first query (craigslist) is stereotypically navigational, showing a spike at the correct answer (www.craigslist.org).
The outcome at the end of each sampling period is a set of records, with each record describing the clickthroughs for a given query/result combination.
The relevance judgments were made by independent  assessors viewing the pages themselves, rather than the captions.
Regrettably, no search engine is perfect, and clickthrough inversions are seen for many queries.
The figure shows the corresponding relevance  judgments.
A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1.
The search engine may have failed in its primary goal, ranking more relevant results below less relevant results.
3.2 Clickthrough curves It could be argued that under ideal circumstances,  clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine logs.
The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al.
Figure 2 provides clickthrough curves for three example queries.
Before turning to the second case, we address the first, and examine the extent to which relevance alone may explain these inversions.
The second query is informational in the sense of Lee et al.
For 28.7% of the inversions, A has greater relevance than B, which received the greater number of clickthroughs. 
Later results would complement earlier ones, linking to novel or supplementary material, and ordered by their interest to the greatest number of users.
Relevance was assessed on a 6-point scale.
Its curve is flatter and less skewed toward a single result.
