First approaches were manual [28] in the sense that the user was the one choosing the relevant results, and then various methods were applied to  extract new terms, related to the query and the selected documents.
Upon issuing a new query, the search results were ranked based on the similarity between each URL and the user profile.
We have also investigated three such  approaches in order to identify query relevant keywords from the rich, yet rather complex Personal Information Repository.
A broadly explored method is to expand the user query with new terms, whose meaning is closely related to the input keywords.
Efthimiadis [11] presented a comprehensive literature review and proposed several simple methods to extract such new keywords based on term frequency, document frequency, etc.
In this section we thus present a separate analysis, first introducing some approaches to personalize search, as this represents the main goal of our research, and then discussing several query expansion techniques and their relationship to our algorithms.
Lam and Jones [21] used summarization to extract  informative sentences from the top-ranked documents, and appended them to the user query.
Haveliwala [13] computed a  topicoriented PageRank, in which 16 PageRank vectors biased on each of the main topics of the Open Directory were initially calculated off-line, and then combined at run-time based on the similarity  between the user query and each of the 16 topics.
Approaches focused on the Personalization Algorithm.
Though orthogonal to our approach, two works are very relevant for the Web environment: Cui et al.
However, not much has been done specifically aimed at combining them.
More recently, Nie et al.
However, we base this  process on analyzing the Desktop level relationship between the  original query and the proposed new keywords.
In this section we survey some of the representative query expansion works grouped according to the source employed to generate additional terms: (1) Relevance feedback, (2)  Collection based co-occurrence statistics, and (3) Thesaurus information.
Terms highly co-occurring with the issued keywords have been shown to increase precision when appended to the query [17].
It is based on  exploiting various social or collection specific characteristics in order to generate additional terms, which are appended to the original  in2 http://myWeb2.search.yahoo.com put keywords before identifying the matching documents returned as output.
2.2 Automatic Query Expansion Automatic query expansion aims at deriving a better formulation of the user query in order to enhance retrieval.
Kraft and Zien [19] showed that anchor text is very similar to user queries, and thus exploited it to acquire additional keywords. 
Only two other approaches enhanced Web search using Desktop data, yet both used different core ideas: (1) Teevan et al.
Approaches focused on the User Profile.
[24] modified the idea by distributing the PageRank of a page across the topics it contains in order to generate topic  oriented rankings.
[34]  modified the query term weights from the BM25 weighting scheme to incorporate user interests as captured by their Desktop indexes; (2) In Chirita et al.
Finally, Yu et al.
[8]  generated word correlations utilizing the probability for query terms to appear in each document, as computed over the search engine logs.
The main idea of Relevance Feedback (RF) is that useful information can be extracted from the relevant documents returned for the initial query.
We used some of these as inspiration for our Desktop specific techniques.
Many statistical measures have been developed to best assess term relationship levels, either  analyzing entire documents [27], lexical affinity relationships [3] (i.e., pairs of closely related words which contain exactly one of the  initial query terms), etc.
[38] selected the expansion terms from vision-based segments of Web pages in order to cope with the multiple topics residing therein.
As the computation of PPVs for larger sets of pages was still quite  expensive, several solutions have been investigated, the most important ones being those of Fogaras and Racz [12], and Sarlos et al.
Effectively building the personalization aspect directly into  PageRank [25] (i.e., by biasing it on a target set of pages) has  received much attention recently.
[6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search  output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing user"s interests.
More, it requires to store all personal  information at the server side, which raises significant privacy concerns.
RF has also been shown to be effectively automatized by considering the top ranked documents as relevant [37] (this is known as Pseudo RF).
This paper brings together two IR areas: Search Personalization and Automatic Query Expansion.
User  profiling based on browsing history has the advantage of being rather easy to obtain and process.
Just as for the co-occurrence methods, initial experiments with this approach were controversial, either reporting improvements, or even  reductions in output quality [36].
[4] maximized the divergence  between the language model defined by the top retrieved documents and that defined by the entire collection.
Qiu and Cho [26] used Machine Learning on the past click history of the user in order to determine topic preference vectors and then apply Topic-Sensitive PageRank [13].
We also use WordNet based expansion terms.
Carpineto et al.
Chang and Hsu [5] asked users to choose relevant clusters, instead of  documents, thus reducing the amount of interaction necessary.
Recently, as the experimental  collections grew larger, and as the employed algorithms became more complex, better results have been obtained [31, 18, 22].
There are many other attempts to extract expansion terms.
Jeh and Widom [16] proposed an algorithm that avoids the massive resources needed for storing one Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV) per user by precomputing PPVs only for a small set of pages and then applying linear combination.
[32] analyzed surfing behavior and generated user profiles as features (terms) of the visited pages.
Sugiyama et al.
Such relationships are usually  extracted from large scale thesauri, as WordNet [23], in which  various sets of synonyms, hypernyms, etc.
This is probably why it is also employed by several industrial search engines (e.g., Yahoo!
This section splits the relevant background according to the focus of each article into either one of these elements.
Some other approaches are also addressed in the end of the section.
However, it is definitely not sufficient for gathering a thorough insight into user"s interests.
2.1 Personalized Search Personalized search comprises two major components: (1) User profiles, and (2) The actual search algorithm.
Moreover, none of these investigated the adaptive application of personalization.
Thesaurus Based Techniques.
Relevance Feedback Techniques.
Other Techniques.
Co-occurrence Based Techniques.
[30], the latter using rounding and count-min sketching in order to fastly obtain accurate enough approximations of the personalized scores.
There exists a vast amount of algorithms for both domains.
are predefined.
