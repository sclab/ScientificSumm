Query expansion assists the user in formulating a better query, by appending additional keywords to the initial search request in order to encapsulate her interests therein, as well as to focus the Web search output accordingly.
The booming popularity of search engines has determined  simple keyword search to become the only widely accepted user  interface for seeking information over the Web.
Search engines should not be able to know about a person"s interests, i.e., they should not be able to connect a  specific person with the queries she issued, or worse, with the output URLs she clicked within the search interface1 (see Volokh [35] for a discussion on privacy issues related to personalized Web search).
The  experiments presented in Section 3.2 show many of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing NDCG [15] improvements of up to 51.28%.
Our algorithms expand Web queries with keywords extracted from user"s PIR, thus implicitly personalizing the search output.
Several advantages arise when moving Web search  personalization down to the Desktop level (note that by Desktop we refer to PIR, and we use the two terms interchangeably).
1 Search engines can map queries at least to IP addresses, for example by using cookies and mining the query logs.
In this paper we propose to enhance Web query reformulation by exploiting the user"s Personal Information Repository (PIR), i.e., the personal collection of text documents, emails, cached Web pages, etc.
Studies have shown that more than 80% of the users would prefer to receive such personalized search results [33] instead of the currently generic ones.
After a discussion of previous works in Section 2, we first  investigate the analysis of local Desktop query context in Section 3.1.1.
This is exactly the Web search scenario!
We propose several keyword, expression, and summary based  techniques for determining expansion terms from those personal  documents matching the Web query best.
However, by moving the user profile at the Desktop level we ensure such information is not explicitly associated to a particular user and stored on the search engine side. 
First is of course the quality of personalization: The local Desktop is a rich repository of information, accurately describing most, if not all  interests of the user.
This yields an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best algorithm.
Clearly, one would prefer search output to be aligned with user"s topic(s) of interest, rather than displaying a selection of popular URLs from each category.
In Section 3.1.2 we move our analysis to the global Desktop collection and investigate expansions based on co-occurrence metrics and external thesauri.
In Section 4 we move this algorithmic framework further and propose to make the  expansion process adaptive to the clarity level of the query.
Second, as all profile information is stored and exploited locally, on the personal machine, another very important benefit is privacy.
Yet keyword queries are inherently ambiguous.
It has been shown to perform very well over large data sets, especially with short input queries (see for example [19, 3]).
The query canon book for example covers several different areas of interest: religion, photography, literature, and music.
We conclude and discuss further work in Section 5.
