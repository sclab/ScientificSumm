While our study uses the language modeling approach as a framework for experiments, we make few assumptions about the actual workings of the feedback algorithm.
Applications such as selective expansion may then be  implemented in a principled way.
The use of sampling is a very flexible and powerful device and is  motivated by our general desire to extend current models of  retrieval by estimating the risk or variance associated with the parameters or output of retrieval processes.
Such variance estimates, for example, may be naturally used in a Bayesian framework for improved model estimation and combination.
It also gives small but consistent gains in  top10 precision.
We believe it is likely that any reasonably effective baseline feedback algorithm would benefit from our approach.
In future work, we envision an investigation into how varying the set of sampling methods used and the number of samples controls the trade-off between  robustness, accuracy, and efficiency.
Our results on standard TREC collections show that our framework  improves the robustness of a strong baseline feedback method across a variety of collections, without sacrificing average precision.
