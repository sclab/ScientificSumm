The results for the case of a cheating seller in a second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as endpoints along a continuum.
In this paper we presented the equilibria of sealed-bid  auctions in which cheating is possible.
The case of agents cheating in a first-price auction showed the robustness of the first-price auction equilibrium when agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution.
In addition to providing strategy profiles that are stable against deviations, these  results give us with insights into both first and second-price auctions.
Finally, results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of cheating. 
We also explored the effect of  overbidding on the best response bidding strategy for other  distributions, and showed that even for relatively simple  distributions it can be positive, negative, or neutral.
