These results provide insights into  sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.
In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the  possibility of cheating.
Motivated by the rise of online auctions and their relative lack of security, this paper analyzes two forms of cheating in sealed-bid auctions.
In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid.
The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder.
