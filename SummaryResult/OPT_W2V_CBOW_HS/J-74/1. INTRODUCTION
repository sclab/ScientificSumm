We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.
At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.
In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the  possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.
For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBay"s server,  observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.
When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed  uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.
Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.
But why should the seller have all the fun?
We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.
In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.
In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each bidder"s value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability).
We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will cheat.
However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.
The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.
This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.
A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.
However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully cheat).
In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.
This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.
In a second-price auction, knowing the  competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.
However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.
In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings.
In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins.
Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.
Note that two of these cases are trivial.
This result shows how first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the  endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.
Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.
We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.
This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.
Possible  motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published exposÂ´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions.
In Section 2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the case of a seller cheating in a second price auction.
To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.
Section 3 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
All proofs and derivations are found in the appendix. 
We discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6.
