The proposed technique can also be adapted to improve the learning in such a  scenario.
The research is important because scalability is a major concern for researchers when using the Bayesian hierarchical linear modeling approach to build a practical large scale system, even though the literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of the models in many applications.
It is worth mentioning that even if the original problem space is not sparse, sparseness can be created artificially when a recommendation system uses user-specific feature selection techniques to reduce the noise and user model complexity.
The proposed new technique can be easily adapted to run on a cluster of machines, and thus further speed up the learning process to handle a larger scale system with hundreds of millions of users.
Although we are focusing on the Bayesian  hierarchical linear models for recommendation and filtering, the new idea of using analytical solution instead of numerical solution for unrelated user-feature pairs at the M step could be adapted to many other problems. 
It is used to find model  parameters in many IR problems where the training data is very sparse.
Our work is one major step on the road to make Bayesian hierarchical linear models more practical.
The Bayesian hierarchical  modeling approach is becoming an important user profile learning approach due to its theoretically justified ability to help one user through information transfer from the other users by way of hyperpriors.
This paper examined the weakness of the popular EM based learning approach for Bayesian hierarchical linear  models and proposed a better learning technique called Modified EM.
Evaluation on the MovieLens and Netflix data sets  demonstrated the effectiveness of the new technique when the data is sparse, by which we mean the ratio of related user-feature pairs to unrelated pairs is small.
We showed that the new technique is theoretically more computationally efficient than the standard EM algorithm.
We also demonstrated that the proposed technique can learn half a million user profiles from 100 million ratings in a few hours with a single CPU.
In general, it is better to use the new  algorithm since it is as simple as standard EM, the performance is either better or similar to EM, and the computation  complexity is lower at each iteration.
Content-based user profile learning is an important  problem and is the key to providing personal recommendations to a user, especially for recommending new items with a small number of ratings.
The research has much potential to benefit people using EM algorithm on many other IR problems as well as  machine learning problems.
Evaluation on the Reuters data set showed that the new technique performed similar to the standard EM algorithm when the sparseness condition does not hold.
EM algorithm is a commonly used machine learning technique.
