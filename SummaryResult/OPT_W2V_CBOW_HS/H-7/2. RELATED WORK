Providing personalized recommendations to users has been identified as a very important problem in the IR community since the 1970"s. The approaches that have been used to solve this problem can be roughly classified into two major categories: content based filtering versus collaborative  filtering.
Similar to some other researchers[18][1][21], we found that a recommendation system will be more effective when both techniques are combined.
This paper contributes to the content-based  recommendation research by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian hierarchical linear models, which have a strong theoretical basis and good empirical performance on  recommendation tasks[27][25].
We think each complements the other, and that content-based filtering is extremely  useful for handling new documents/items with little or no user feedback.
Collaborative filtering goes beyond merely using document content to recommend items to a user by leveraging information from other users with similar tastes and preferences in the past.
This paper does not intend to compare content-based filtering with collaborative filtering or claim which one is a better.
Content-based filtering studies the scenario where a recommendation system monitors a document stream and pushes documents that match a user profile to the  corresponding user.
Memorybased heuristics and model based approaches have been used in collaborative filtering task [15] [8] [2] [14] [12] [11].
The user may read the delivered documents and provide explicit relevance feedback, which the filtering system then uses to update the user"s profile using relevance feedback retrieval models (e.g.
Boolean models, vector space models, traditional probabilistic models [20] , inference  networks [3] and language models [6]) or machine learning  algorithms (e.g.
However, this is  beyond the scope of this paper and thus not discussed here. 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), K nearest neighbors (K-NN) clustering, neural networks, logistic  regression, or Winnow [16] [4] [23]).
