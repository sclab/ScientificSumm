In this paper we propose a new parallel two-sided search mechanism that differs from the existing one in a sense that it allows the agents to delay their decision making process concerning the acceptance and rejection of potential partnerships as necessary.
While the analysis we present is given in the context of software agents, the model we suggest is general, and can be applied to any two-sided economic search environment where the searchers can search in parallel.
As we prove in Section 2, in spite of the transition to a sequential decision making, deadlocks never occur in the proposed method as long as all agents use the proposed strategies.
Our analysis covers all aspects of the new two-sided search  technique, from individual strategy construction throughout the  dynamics that lead to stability (equilibrium).
Our capabilities to produce an upper bound for the number of parallel interactions used in equilibrium (Theorem 4) and to quickly identify (and eliminate) non-equilibrium strategies (Theorem 3) resolves the problem of the computational complexity associated with having to deal with a theoretically infinite strategy space.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) As discussed throughout the paper, the new method is much more intuitive to the agent than the existing model - an agent will always prefer to keep all options available.
In particular, in addition to weakly dominating the instantaneous decision making model (as we prove in the  analysis section) the proposed method weakly dominates the purely  sequential two-sided search model (where each agent interacts with only one other agent at a time) [5].
Furthermore, as we prove in the former sections, an agent"s transition to the new search method always results with a better utility.
The current paper is not focused on re-arguing applicability, but rather on the improvement of the the core two-sided search model.
This, in  comparison to the existing instantaneous model [21] which force each agent to make a simultaneous decision concerning each of the  potential partnerships revealed to it during the current search stage.
The multiple-interactions technique is known to be  beneficial for agents both in one-sided and two-sided economic search [7, 16, 21], since it allows the agents to decrease their average cost of learning about potential partnerships and their values.
This complexity (that does not exist in former  models) is resolved by the introduction of the recursive function Gk(x) in Section 2.
We see great importance in future research that will combine  bargaining as part of the interaction process.
This derives from the fact that the proposed method is a generalization of the latter (i.e., in the worst case scenario, the agent can interact with one other agent at a time in parallel).
Similarly, we show that a deviation of a single agent (back) to the instantaneous decision making strategy is not  beneficial.
The phenomenal growth evidenced in recent years in the number of software agent-based applications, alongside the continuous  improvement in agents" processing and communication capabilities, suggest various incentives for agents to improve their search  performance by applying advanced search strategies such as parallel search.
The difficulty in the  extraction of the agents" equilibrium strategies in the new model derives from the need to recursively model, while setting an agent"s  strategy, the rejection other agents might face from other agents they interact with.
Since our analysis is equilibrium-based, a deviation from the proposed strategies is not beneficial.
Justification and legitimacy considerations for this integration were  discussed in the wide literature we refer to throughout the paper.
While equilibrium analysis normally do not consider malfunction as a legitimate strategy, we do wish to  emphasize that the malfunctioning agent problem can be resolved by using a simple timeout for receiving responses and skipping this agent in the sequential decision process if the timeout is exceeded.
We believe such research can result in many rich variants of our two-sided search model. 
The only problem that may arise in the transition from an instantaneous to sequential decision making is when an agent fails (technically) to function (endlessly delaying the notification to the agents it interacted with).
Using the different theorems and propositions we prove, we proffer efficient tools for calculating the agents"  equilibrium strategies.
Naturally the attempt to integrate search theory techniques into day-to-day applications brings up the applicability question.
