While coalition  formation models usually consider general coalition-sizes [24], the  partnership formation model (often referred as matchmaking)  considers environments where agents have a benefit only when forming a partnership and this benefit can not be improved by extending the partnership to more than two agents [12, 23] (e.g., in the case of buyers and sellers or peer-to-peer applications).
Here the sequential search procedure is often applied, allowing the searcher to  investigate a single [15] or multiple [7, 19] opportunities at a time.
Nevertheless, in the sequential bargaining literature, most emphasis is put on specifying the details of the sequential negotiating process over the division of the utility (or cost) jointly owned by parties or the strategy the coalition needs to adopt [20, 4].
While the search in agent-based environments is well recognized to be costly [11, 21, 1], most of the proposed coalition formation mechanisms assume that an agent can scan as many partnership opportunities in its environment as needed or have access to central matchers or middle agents [6].
The models  presented in this area do not associate the coalition formation process with search costs, which is the essence of the analysis that  economic search theory aims to supply.
Several of the two-sided search essences can be found in the strategic theory of bargaining [3] - both coalition formation and matching can be represented as a sequential bargaining game [4] in which payoffs are defined as a function of the coalition structure and can be divided according to a fixed or negotiated division rule.
As in the general 8 The use of the term partnership in this context refers to the agreement between two individual agents to cooperate in a pre-defined manner.
coalition formation case, agents have the incentive to form  partnerships when they are incapable of executing a task by their own or when the partnership can improve their individual utilities [14].
In these  models, classified as one-sided search, the focus is on establishing the optimal strategies for the searcher, assuming no mutual search  activities (i.e., no influence on the environment).
A first attempt to integrate the parallel search into a two-sided search model is given in [21], as detailed in the introduction section.
The incorporation of costly search in this context is quite rare [21] and to the best of our knowledge, a distributed two-sided search for partners model similar to the S-DM model has not been studied to date.
Therefore, in these models, the equilibrium strategies are always developed based on the assumption that the agents interact with others sequentially (i.e., with one agent at a time).
While the latter method is proven to be beneficial for the searcher, it was never used in the two-sided search models that followed (where dual search activities are modeled) [22, 5, 18].
Classical economic search theory ([15, 17], and references therein) widely addresses the problem of a searcher operating in a costly  environment, seeking to maximize his long term utility.
However, in many MAS environments, in the absence of any reliable central matching mechanism, the matching process is completely distributed.
The two-sided economic search for partnerships in AI literature is a sub-domain of coalition formation8 .
Furthermore, even in repeated pairwise bargaining [10] models the agents are always limited to initiating a single bargaining interaction at a time. 
For example, in the buyer-seller application a partnership is defined as an agreed transaction between the two-parties [9].
Various centralized matching mechanisms can be found in the  literature [6, 2, 8].
