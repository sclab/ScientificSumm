Working on a focused subset of the data helps to overcome problems two and three, listed above.
This led to a corpus of 15,165 documents.
Based on this corpus, we hoped to derive k ≈ 10 topical categories, such that each document di is assigned to one or more classes.
DISCOVERY To aid in the discovery of a new set of high-level topics for the BLS website, we turned to unsupervised machine  learning methods.
Mutually exclusive clusters are inappropriate for  identifying the topical content of documents, since  documents may be about many subjects.
In light of these problems, we take a hybrid approach to topic discovery.
The  problems with standard clustering are threefold.
First, we limit the clustering process to a sample of the entire collection, described in Section 4.
), many  documents" terms provide noisy topical information.
In efforts to let the data speak for themselves, we desired a means of concept discovery that would be based not on the structure of the agency, but on the content of the material.
For application to the relation browser, we require a small number (k ≈ 10) of topics.
Without significant data reduction, term-based clustering tends to deliver clusters at too fine a level of granularity.
To address the  problem of mutual exclusivity, we combine unsupervised with supervised learning methods, as described in Section 5. 
Due to the heterogeneity of the data housed in the BLS collection (tables, lists, surveys, etc.
To begin this process, we crawled the BLS  website, downloading all documents of MIME type text/html.
[16]) provided an obvious, but only partial solution to the problem of automating this type of high-level information architecture discovery.
