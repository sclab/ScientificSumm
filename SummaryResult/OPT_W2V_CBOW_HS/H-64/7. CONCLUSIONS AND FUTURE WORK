In current work we have defined algorithms to identify  documents likely to help the topic discovery task.
Instead of clustering documents to find topics and then fitting a model to the learned clusters, our goal is to expand the unsupervised portion of our analysis beyond a narrow subset of the collection, such as The Editor"s Desk.
As we have argued in this paper, these methods may also be brought to bear on the design and implementation of advanced user interfaces.
While it is not surprising that editor-generated keywords should give strong evidence for such learning, their superiority over  fulltext and titles was dramatic, suggesting that even a small amount of metadata can be very useful for data mining.

Empirical  methods of knowledge discovery can aid in the organization and retrieval of information.
Overall, then, the techniques described here provide an encouraging start to our work on acquiring subject  metadata for dynamic interfaces automatically.
Supplied with a more comprehensive training set, we hope to experiment with model-based clustering, which combines the clustering and classification processes into a single modeling procedure.
While we saw fairly good results (classification accuracy of 75% with respect to a small sample of human judges), this experiment forced us to reconsider the quality of the topics learned by clustering.
Data mining and machine learning methods hold a great deal of promise with respect to this problem.
Finally, then, in future work we will build on the user studies undertaken by Marchionini and Brunk in efforts to evaluate the utility of automatically populated dynamic interfaces for the users of digital libraries. 
The high correlation among human judgments in our sample suggests that the topics discovered by  analysis of the Editor"s Desk were not independent.
However, we also found evidence that learning topics from a subset of the collection may lead to overfitted models.
Comparing three modes of document representation-full-text, title only, and keyword-we found 98% accuracy as measured by  collocation of documents with identical subject headings.
While we do not desire mutually exclusive categories in our setting, we do desire independence among the topics we model.
This study explored a hybrid technique for aiding  information architects as they implement dynamic interfaces such as the relation browser.
The goal of this initial stage is to discover the most basic and far-reaching topics in the collection.
Our approach combines  unsupervised learning techniques, applied to a focused subset of the BLS website.
What is increasingly clear, however, as digital libraries grow in scope and complexity, is the applicability of these techniques to problems at the front-end of systems such as information architecture and interface design.
Topic discovery and document classification have long been recognized as fundamental problems in information retrieval and other forms of text mining.
After clustering 1279 Editor"s Desk documents into 10  categories, we fitted a 10-way naive Bayes classifier to categorize the remaining 14,000 documents in the collection.
Given increasingly large, complex bodies of data, how may we improve access to  collections without incurring extraordinary cost, and while also keeping systems receptive to changes in content over time?
It also suggests that a more sophisticated modeling approach might yield 158 better results in the future.
In the study reported here, this approach has  demonstrated promise.
In upcoming work we will  experiment with streamlining the two-phase technique described here.
It also appears to give fairly good results.
In its favor, our approach is highly scalable.
Many developers and maintainers of digital libraries share the basic problem pursued here.
