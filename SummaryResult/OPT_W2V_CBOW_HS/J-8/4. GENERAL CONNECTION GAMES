First we show how to find a sub-tree T of T∗ , such that for any edge e, the payments of players with sinks in T∗ e is more than the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e}.
We will show that there exists a sub-tree T of T∗ , that connects a subset of players Γ ⊆ N, and a new set of payments ¯p, such that for each i ∈ Γ, ci(¯p) < ci(p).
Next we show that no player k > i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti.
t. Then Q = ¯Qi ∪ Q is a path from the source s to the sink t. For any player j < i, let yj be the intersecting vertex of Q and tj (by Lemma 2.1 one is guarantee to exist).
(The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.) Considering the edges in e ∈ B we can see that any subtree T∗ e we delete from T can not decrease the difference between the payments and the cost of the remaining tree.
What remain is to find payments ¯p for the players in Γ(T ) such that they will buy the tree T and every player in Γ(T ) will lower its cost, i.e.
Player i wishes to connect the source s with its sink ti.We need to consider only the NE profiles: (i) if all three players use the link of cost 3, then there must be two agents whose total sum exceeds 2, thus they can both reduce cost by deviating to an edge of cost 2− .
To build T , define an edge e to be bad if the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e} is at least the payments of the players with sinks in T∗ e , i.e., c(T∗ e ∪ {e}) ≥ P(T∗ e ).
This will contradict the assumption that p is a strong equilibrium.
This implies that when we assign payments for e, we have that the sum of the payments in Te is equal to c(Te) = i∈Γ(Te) ci(¯p, Te).
This is a contradiction to the minimality of the coalition Γ size, since the players in Γ \ {i} can form a smaller coalition with payments ¯p.
Let ci(¯p, Te) = e∈Te ¯pi(e) be the payments of player i for the  subtree Te.
Here, we show that any strong equilibrium in single source general connection games yields the optimal cost.
For a set of edges E, let c(E) = e∈E ce.
After the update we have for player i ∈ Γ(Te), ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) = ci(¯p, Te) + ¯pi(e) = ci(¯p, Te) + ∆i ce j∈Γ(Te) ∆j = ci(p) − ∆i(1 − ce P(Γ(Te)) − c(Te) ), where we used the fact that j∈Γ(Te) ∆j = P(Γ(Te))−c(Te).
Consider a player k > i and let Qk = Qk ∪ Qk , where Qk is a path connecting tk to t. Let yk be the intersecting vertex of Qk and ti.
Now we have a tree T and our coalition will be Γ(T ).
When COMPUTE-SE considers player j, the cost of the edges that players 1 to j−1 have bought is set to zero, and player j fully buys a shortest path Qj from s to tj.
, pn) be a strong equilibrium, and let T∗ be the minimum cost Steiner tree on all players, rooted at the (single) source s. Let T∗ e be the subtree of T∗ disconnected from s when edge e is removed.
Let Q be a path from the sink of player i, i.e.
(ii) if two of the players use an edge of cost 2− jointly, and the third player uses a different edge of cost 2 − , then, the players with non-zero payments can deviate to the path with the edge of cost 3 and reduce their costs (since before the deviation the total payments of the players is 4 − 2 ).
case a: After the deviation player i does not pay for edges in j∈Γ\{i} ¯Qj .
Therefore player i fully pays for all edges on the path ¯Qi y,ti , i.e., ¯pi(e) = ce for all edges e ∈ ¯Qi y,ti .
We will show that for every subtree Te, ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) < ci(p), and hence ci(¯p) < ci(p).
Therefore, in T for every edge e, we have that c(Te ∪ {e}) < P(Te).
Let Γ be such a coalition of minimal size and let player i = max{j ∈ Γ}.
Note that we can find a subset B of B such that ∪e∈B(T∗ e ∪ {e}) is equal to ∪e∈B (T∗ e ∪ {e}) and for any e1, e2 ∈ B we have T∗ e1 ∩ T∗ e2 = ∅.
Next we show that for the class of series parallel graphs, there is always a strong equilibrium in the case of a single source.
Each player i will fully buy a subset of the edges, and any player j > i will consider the cost of those (bought) edges as zero.
For a player j ∈ Γ let ¯Qj and ¯pj be the path and payment of player j after the deviation, respectively.
ti, to the sink of G, i.e.
case b: Otherwise, we show that player i cost after the  deviation, i.e.
Therefore, we can update the payments ¯p of players i ∈ Γ(Te), by setting ¯pi(e) = ce∆i/( j∈Γ(Te) ∆j), where ∆j = cj(p) − cj(¯p, Te).
Namely, for every edges e ∈ Qj \ ∪i<jQi we have pj(e) = ce and otherwise pj(e) = 0.
In every single source general connection game on a series-parallel graph, there exists a strong  equilibrium.
ci(p) > ci(¯p) for i ∈ Γ(T ).
Recall that given two vertices u, v on path ¯Q we denote by ¯Qu,v the subpath of ¯Q from u to v. 90 Before the deviation of the coalition Γ, a path from s to y was fully paid for by the players j < i.
We assign the payments of edge e in T , after we assign payments to all the edges in Te.
We will now define the coalition payments ¯p.
Then, there exists a coalition that can improve the costs of all its players by a deviation.
We define T to be T∗ − ∪e∈B(T∗ e ∪ {e}).
4.2 Strong Price of Anarchy While for every single source general connection game, it holds that PoS = 1 [3], the price of anarchy can be as large as n, even for two parallel edges.
(Recall that the payments have the restriction that player i can only pay for edges on the path from s to ti.)
Now consider the algorithm  COMPUTESE at the step when player i selects a shortest path from the source s to its sink ti and determines his payment pi.
Since ce < P(Γ(Te)) − c(Te) it follows that ci(¯p, Te ∪ {e}) < ci(p). 
This contradicts the fact that player i  improved its cost and therefore not all the players in Γ reduce their cost.
Let B be the set of bad edges.
While every single source general connection game  possesses a pure Nash equilibrium [3], it does not necessarily admit some strong equilibrium.11 10 This is a variation on the example given in [2].
Since there exists a path from s to yk that was fully paid for by players j < k before the deviation, in  particularly the path Qi s,yk , player k will not pay for any edge on any path connecting s and yk.
For players i and j, we have that i → j if there is a directed path from ti to tj.
Hence, ci(¯p) ≥ ci(p).
Since e was not a bad edge, we know that c(Te ∪ {e}) = c(Te) + ce < P(Te).
ci(¯p), is at least his cost before the deviation, i.e.
Assume by way of contradiction that c(p) > c(T∗ ).
Let Γ(Te) be the set of players which have sinks in Te.
At this point, player i could buy the path ¯Qi y,ti , since a path from s to y was already paid for by players j < i.
4.1 Existence of Strong Equilibrium We begin with a characterization of the existence of a strong equilibrium in symmetric general connection games.
ci(p), contradicting the fact that player i improved his cost.
Assume by way of contradiction that the profile p is not a SE.
Let Λ be a single source general connection game on a SPG G = (V, E) with source s and sink t. We present an algorithm that constructs a specific SE.
In single source general connection game, if there exists a strong equilibrium, then the strong price of anarchy is 1.
We first consider the following partial order between the players.
Let P(Te) = i∈Γ(Te) ci(p).
The path from the source s to node y was fully paid for by players j < i in p (before the deviation).
We showed that none of the NE are SE, and thus the game does not possess any SE.
In every symmetric fair connection game there exists a strong equilibrium.
Let y be the furthest vertex on the path Q such that y = yj for some j < i.
This implies that p is a strong equilibrium.
There exists a single source general  connection game that does not admit any strong equilibrium.
Consider the  following bottom up process that defines ¯p.
we assume that 1 → 2 → · · · → n. The algorithm COMPUTE-SE, considers the players in an increasing order, starting with player 1.
We complete the partial order to a full order (in an arbitrary way), and w.l.o.g.
Consider single source general connection game with 3 players on the graph depicted in Figure 4.
There are two cases we consider.
We next show that the algorithm  COMPUTESE computes a SE.
In this section, we derive our results for general connection games.
Let p = (p1, .
Similar to Theorem 3.1 (using a similar proof) we establish, Theorem 4.1.
