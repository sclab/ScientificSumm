An extension parallel graph (EPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 →e G2, where G1 and G2 are 5 We limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti and payment only on those edges.
A symmetric connection game implies that the source and sink of all the players are identical.
In a general connection game the actions Σi of player i is a payment vector pi, where pi(e) is how much player i is offering to contribute to the cost of edge e.5 Given a profile p, any edge e such that i pi(e) ≥ ce is considered bought, and Ep denotes the set of bought edges.
Let G be an SPG with source s and sink t. Given a path Q, from s to t, and a vertex t , there exist a vertex y ∈ Q, such that for any path Q from s to t , the path Q contains y and the paths Qy,t and Q are edge disjoint.
2.2 Cost Sharing Connection Games A cost sharing connection game has an underlying  directed graph G = (V, E) where each edge e ∈ E has an associated cost ce ≥ 04 .
We denote by NE(Λ) the set of pure Nash equilibria in the game Λ.
Resilience to coalitions: A pure deviation of a set of  players Γ ⊂ N (also called coalition) specifies an action for each player in the coalition, i.e., γ ∈ ×i∈ΓΣi.
Clearly, each player tries to minimize his total payment which is ci(p) = e∈Ep pi(e) if si is connected to ti in Gp, and infinity otherwise.6 We denote by c(p) = i ci(p) the total cost under the profile p. For a subgraph H of G we denote the total cost of the edges in H by c(H).
The social cost of a game Λ is the sum of the costs of the players, and we denote by OPT(Λ) the minimal social cost of a game Λ.
To create G = G1||G2 we identify the sources s1 and s2, forming a new source node s, and identify the sinks t1 and t2, forming a new sink t. • Series composition: Given two directed graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), with sources s1 ∈ V1 and s2 ∈ V2 and sinks t1 ∈ V1 and t2 ∈ V2, respectively, we define a new graph G = G1 → G2 as follows.
A joint action S ∈ Σ is a pure Nash equilibrium if no player i ∈ N can benefit from unilaterally deviating from his action to another action, i.e., ∀i ∈ N ∀Si ∈ Σi : ci(S−i, Si) ≥ ci(S).
More formally, given graph G = (V, E) we define the identification of a node v1 ∈ V and v2 ∈ V forming a new node v ∈ V as creating a new graph G = (V , E ), where V = V −{v1, v2}∪{v} and E includes the edges of E where the edges of v1 and v2 are now connected to v. • Parallel composition: Given two directed graphs, G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2), with sources s1 ∈ V1 and s2 ∈ V2 and sinks t1 ∈ V1 and t2 ∈ V2, respectively, we define a new graph G = G1||G2 as follows.
More formally, the cost function of each player on an edge e, in a joint action S, is fe(ne(S)) = ce ne(S) , where ne(S) is the  number of players that selected a path containing edge e in S. The cost of player i, when selecting path Qi ∈ Σi is ci(S) = e∈Qi fe(ne(S)).
The cost of each edge is shared equally by the set of all players whose paths  contain it.
A pure Nash equilibrium S ∈ Σ is a k-strong equilibrium, if there is no coalition Γ of size at most k, such that S is not resilient to a pure deviation by Γ.
To create G = G1 → G2 we identify the vertices t1 and s2, forming a new vertex u.
A series parallel graph (SPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 → G2, where G1 and G2 are series parallel graphs.
The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is the ratio between the maximal cost of a pure Nash equilibrium (assuming one exists) and the social optimum, i.e., maxS∈NE(Λ) costΛ(S) /OPT(Λ).
Let Gp = (V, Ep) denote the graph bought by the players for profile p = (p1, .
Player i ∈ N has a set Σi of actions, the joint  action set is Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn and a joint action S ∈ Σ is also called a profile.
In a connection game each player i ∈ N has an associated source si and sink ti.
A joint action S ∈ Σ is not resilient to a pure deviation of a coalition Γ if there is a pure joint action γ of Γ such that ci(S−Γ, γ) < ci(S) for every i ∈ Γ (i.e., the players in the coalition can deviate in such a way that each player in the coalition reduces its cost).
• Extension composition : A series composition when one of the graphs, G1 or G2, is composed of a  single directed edge is an extension composition, and we denote it by G = G1 →e G2.
We denote by SE(Λ) the set of n-strong equilibria, and call S ∈ SE(Λ) a strong equilibrium (SE).
Similarly, the Price of Stability (PoS) is the  ratio between the minimal cost of a pure Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., minS∈NE(Λ) costΛ(S)/OPT(Λ).
6 This implies that in equilibrium every player has its sink and source connected by a path in Gp.
2.1 Game Theory definitions A game Λ =< N, (Σi), (ci) > has a finite set N = {1, .
(We call the vertex y the intersecting vertex of Q and t .)
The k-Strong Price of Anarchy (k-SPoA) is the ratio between the maximal cost of a k-strong equilibrium (assuming one exists) and the social optimum, i.e., maxS∈k-SE(Λ) costΛ(S) /OPT(Λ).
In a fair connection game the actions Σi of player i  include all the paths from si to ti.
, Sn) denote the profile of actions taken by the players, and let S−i = (S1, .
Given a path Q and two vertices u, v on Q, we denote the subpath of Q from u to v by Qu,v.
A single source connection game implies that the sources of all the players are identical.
Similarly, the Strong Price of Stability (SPoS) is the ratio between the minimal cost of a pure strong equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e., minS∈SE(Λ) costΛ(S)/OPT(Λ).
, Sn) denote the profile of actions taken by all players other than player i.
The graph G has a source s = s1 and a sink t = t2.
Given a joint action, the cost of a player is the sum of his costs on the edges it selected.
We denote by k-SE(Λ) the set of k-strong equilibria in the game Λ.
Finally, A multi commodity connection game implies that each player has its own source and sink.
85 ci : Σ → R+ , which maps the joint action S ∈ Σ to a non-negative real number.
The cost function of player i is 3 In [19] they allow to restrict some players from using certain links, even though the links exist in the graph, while we do not allow this, and assume that the available strategies for players are fully represented by the underlying graph.

Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) be the union graph.
(We also call a  symmetric connection game a single source single sink connection game, or a single commodity connection game.)
Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E1 ∪ E2) be the union graph.
86 extension parallel graphs (and in the extension composition either G1 or G2 is a single edge.).
2.3 Extension Parallel and Series Parallel Directed Graphs Our directed graphs would be acyclic, and would have a source node (from which all nodes are reachable) and a sink node (which every node can reach).
We first define the following actions for composition of directed graphs.
4 In some of the existence proofs, we assume that ce > 0 for simplicity.
Next we define the Price of Anarchy [9], Price of  Stability [2], and their extension to Strong Price of Anarchy and Strong Price of Stability.
The SPoA is the n-SPoA.
Note that both k-SPoA and SPoS are defined only if some strong equilibrium exists.
The following lemma, whose proof appears in the full version, would be the main topological tool in the case of single source graph.
of anarchy (k-SPoA) for the game Λ.
The full version contains the complete proofs for the case ce ≥ 0.
Let S = (S1, .
Note that S = (Si, S−i).
i.e., OPT(Λ) = minS∈Σ costΛ(S), where costΛ(S) = i∈N ci(S).
• Identification: The identification operation allows to collapse two nodes to one.
