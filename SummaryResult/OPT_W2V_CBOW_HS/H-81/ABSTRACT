The evaluation presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures suggested by the MPEG-7 group for the visual descriptors can be beaten by general-purpose measures.
Additionally, a quantisation model was developed to be able to use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well.
In visual information retrieval the careful choice of suitable proximity measures is a crucial success factor.
Three media collections were created and assessed, performance indicators developed and more than 22500 tests performed.
The evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in the MPEG-7-standard are among the best but that other measures perform even better.
