For each descriptor the best measure and the performance of the MPEG-7 recommendation are shown.
Remarkably for a predicate-based measure, Tversky's Feature Contrast Model (P1) is also in the group of very good measures (even though it is not among the best) that ends with Q5, the correlation coefficient.
135 best distance measures per descriptor, Section 5.2 shows the best overall distance measures and Section 5.3 points out other interesting results (for example, distance measures that work particularly good on specific ground truth groups).
5.3 Other interesting results Distance measures that perform in average worse than others may in certain situations (e.g.
In the author's opinion, the reason why pattern difference performs so extremely well on many descriptors is due to this fact.
Results per measure and descriptor.
Distance measurement is fair if the following condition holds true for any predicate-based measure dP and any continuous measure dC: ( ) ( )CP dcppdcp ≈, Then, it is guaranteed that predicate-based measures do not create larger clusters (with a higher number of similar objects) for the price of higher cluster pollution.
Psychological research on human visual perception has revealed that in many situation differences between the query object and a candidate weigh much stronger than common properties.
For Color Layout, for example, Q7 is a very good measure on colour photos.
Shades have the following meaning: black=µ-σ (good cases), black + dark grey=µ (average) and black + dark grey + light grey=µ+σ (bad).
For this descriptor the second indicator is up to eight times higher than for predicate-based measures on other descriptors.
The reason why the Meehl index is better may be that this descriptors generates descriptions with elements that have very similar variance.
It can be seen that the best overall measure is a predicate-based one.
Additional advantages of pattern difference are that it usually has a very low variance  andbecause it is a predicate-based measure - its discriminance (and cluster structure) can be tuned with parameter p. The best measure for Dominant Color turned out to be Clark's Divergence coefficient (Q4).
The pattern difference measure implements this insight in the most consequent way.
For Color Structure, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Region-based Shape and Scalable Color by far the best measure is pattern difference (P6).
For artificial images the pattern difference and the Hamming distance produce comparable results as well.
After testing it for retrieval on various distance measures the author supports this opinion.
This is a similar measure to pattern difference on the continuous domain.
If colour information is available in media objects, pattern difference performs well on Dominant Color (just 20% worse Q4) and in case of difficult ground truth (group 5, 7, 10) the Meehl index is as strong as P6.
The top performance of pattern difference (P6) proves that the quantisation model is a reasonable method to extend predicate-based distance measures on the continuous domain.
The third best measure is the Meehl index (Q8), a measure developed for psychological applications but because of its characteristic properties  tailormade for certain (homogeneous) descriptors.
In the MPEG-7 standard it is recommended to use it exclusively for browsing.
The diagram should give an indication on the general potential of the investigated distance measures for visual information retrieval.
It is very difficult to find a good distance measure for Texture Browsing.
The best measure is predicate-based (P7).
For Color Layout the difference between MP7 and the best measure, the Meehl index (Q8), is just 4% and the MPEG-7 measure has a smaller standard deviation.
Of course, these measures do not perform particularly well for any of the descriptors.
The results are aggregated over the tested datasets.
The horizontal axis shows the best measure and the performance of the MPEG-7 recommendation for each descriptor.
The proposed Manhattan metric, for example, performs very bad.
The second best group of measures are the MPEG-7 recommendations, which have a slightly higher mean but a lower standard deviation than pattern difference.
The other measures either have a significantly higher mean or a very large standard deviation.
5.2 Best overall measures Figure 3 summarises the results over all descriptors and media collections.
In a first step parameter p had to be set in a way that all measures are equally discriminant.
On first sight, it becomes clear that the MPEG-7 recommendations are mostly relatively good but never the best.

on specific content) still perform better.
Minkowski metrics are also among the best measures: the average mean and variance of the Manhattan metric (Q1) and the Euclidean metric (Q2) are in the range of Q8.
It works on common properties (a, d) but produces clusters with very high cluster pollution.
In more than 1000 test queries the optimum value was found to be p=1.
In the results presented below the first indicator from Subsection 4.2 was used to evaluate distance measures.
The vertical axis shows the values for the first indicator (smaller value = better cluster structure).
The Texture Browsing descriptor is a special problem.
It performs as good as Q8 and has a lower standard deviation.
Statistical analysis confirmed that (see [6]).
