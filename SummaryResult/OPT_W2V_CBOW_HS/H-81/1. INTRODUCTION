Each descriptor consists of a feature extraction mechanism, a description (in binary and XML format) and guidelines that define how to apply the descriptor on different kinds of media (e.g.
The hypothesis is that analytically derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.
Finally, Section 5 presents the results per descriptor and over all descriptors. 
In the present study a large number of successful distance measures from different areas (statistics, psychology, medicine, social and economic sciences, etc.)
However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.
From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.
For retrieval applications, a rule for each descriptor is mandatory that defines how to measure the similarity of two descriptions.
were implemented and applied on MPEG-7 data vectors to verify whether or not the recommended MPEG-7 distance measures are really the best for any reasonable class of media objects.
face description) and sum up to 16 basic descriptors.
In the following, we will exclusively deal with the visual MPEG-7 descriptors in the context of media retrieval.
Section 3 gives an overview over the implemented distance measures.
The MPEG-7 standard defines - among others - a set of descriptors for visual media.
Unfortunately, the MPEG-7 standard does not include distance measures in the normative part, because it was not designed to be (and should not exclusively understood to be) retrieval-specific.
These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors' behaviour and the description structures.
The paper is organised as follows.
Section 2 gives a minimum of background information on the MPEG-7 descriptors and distance measurement in visual information retrieval (VIR, see [3], [16]).
Section 4 describes the test setup, including the test data and the implemented evaluation methods.
on temporal media).
The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially  complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc.
Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.
The visual MPEG-7 descriptors fall in five groups: colour, texture, shape, motion and others (e.g.
