Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.
Consequently, many well known distance measures are based on geometric assumptions of descriptor space (e.g.
In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 
Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).
Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g.
Descriptors for spatiotemporal aggregation and localisation are: Spatial 2D Coordinates, Grid Layout, Region Locator (spatial), Time Series, Temporal Interpolation (temporal) and SpatioTemporal Locator (combined).
Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.
To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.
The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.
The basic descriptors are Color Layout, Color Structure, Dominant Color, Scalable Color, Edge Histogram, Homogeneous Texture, Texture Browsing, Region-based Shape, Contour-based Shape, Camera Motion, Parametric Motion and Motion Activity.
2.2 Similarity measurement on visual data Generally, similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.
If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.
These additional structures allow combining the basic descriptors in multiple ways and on different levels.
If multiple descriptors are used (e.g.
Not all of them are really descriptors in the sense that they extract properties from visual media.
Unfortunately, human perception is much more complex than any of the existing similarity models (it includes perception, recognition and subjectivity).
a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.
Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.
Some of them are just structures for descriptor aggregation or localisation.
The distance between these objects is measured by computing the distance between the two vectors.
The query object may be natural (e.g.
Tversky's Feature Contrast Model [17]) and fit better with human perception.
Euclidean distance is based on the metric axioms).
Finally, other structures exist for colour spaces, colour quantisation and multiple 2D views of 3D objects.
Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g.
Iteration for multiple candidates allows then to define a partial order over the candidates and to address those in a (to be defined) neighbourhood being similar to the query object.
2.1 MPEG-7: visual descriptors The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard defines several descriptors.
properties of a group of objects).
Consequently, structures for aggregation and localisation were not considered in the work described in this paper.
But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.
Both, query object and candidate object are represented by their corresponding feature vectors.
At this point, it has to be mentioned that in a multi-descriptor  environmentespecially in MPEG-7 - we are only half way towards a statement on similarity.

due to human subjectivity).
