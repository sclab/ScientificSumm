This equilibrium consists of the following choices: first a proposes P3 ; player 1 rejects this offer; a proposes then P2 and both players 1 and 2 accepts otherwise they are threatened to  receive the worse offer P1 for them.
If any player k rejects P, then the next period t+1 begins: player a makes another proposal P by taking into account  information provided by the players and the ones that have rejected P apply a penalty.
• Wait that all players of A give their opinion (Yes , Ψk(Pt )) or (No , Ψk(Pt )) to the player a.
We also have the following notation: δk is the  threshold decrease factor of player k, Φk : Pk → Xk is player k"s function to convert a proposal to an option and Ψk is the function indicating which points P has to be improved, with Ψk its dual function - on which points no  improvement is necessary.
If all players agree on P, this later is chosen.
Analysing the previous example, one sees that the game outcome at the equilibrium is P2 that is not very attractive for player 2.
Hence protocol P1 is strictly equivalent to a game in 1 A subgame perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium such that players" strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the original game [18, 16].
A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to unilaterally change his/her action [15].
More precisely, the utility of player k ∈ A at period t regarding offer P is Uk(Φk(Pk), t) = ft(Uk(Φk(Pk))), where one can take for instance ft(x) = x.
Assume that ft(x) = x − 0.1 t. Consider the following table giving the utilities at t = 0.
In order to introduce this notion of balanceness in the protocol, we introduce a condition under which a player will be obliged to accept the proposal, reducing the autonomy of the agents but for increasing rationality and cooperation.
An offer is a  vector P = (P1, P2, · · · , Pm), a partition of Q, in which Pk is player k"s share of Q.
P1 P2 P3 a 1 0.8 0.7 1 0.1 0.7 0.5 2 0.1 0.3 0.8 It is easy to see that there is one single subgame perfect  equilibrium for protocol P1 corresponding to these values.
Ψk is obtained using the dual function of ωC (Hk, x): eωC (Hk, x)= Z 1 0 Hk(x) − Hk ` τ xC , xNk\C ´ eEC (τ, x) dτ Where eEC (τ, x) is the cost/effort to go from (τxC , xNk\C ) to x.
In period t of our consensus procedure, player a proposes an agreement P. All players k ∈ A respond to a by  accepting or rejecting P. The responses are made simultaneously.
If all players agree on P, this later is chosen.
We expect that protocol P2 provides a solution not to far from P , so it favours fairness among the players.
Rational players (in the sense of von Neumann and  Morgenstern) involved in protocol P1 will necessarily come up with a subgame perfect equilibrium.
It is interesting to point out that, even though a prefers P2 to P3 , offer P3 is first proposed and this make P2 being accepted.
A player k must accept the offer if Uk(Φk(Pk)) ≥ ρk(t) where ρk(t) tends to zero when t grows.
If all players agree on P, this later is chosen.
Moreover there exists T such that for all t ≥ T, ρk(t) = 0.
Therefore, our cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue protocol is the following: Protocol P. • At the beginning we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before, considering Ψk(Pt ) and Ψk(Pt ) for all players k ∈ A.
Option P1 is the best one for a but the two other players vetoed it.
If a proposes P2 first, then the subgame perfect equilibrium in this situation is P3 .
A player k must accept the offer if Uk(Φk(Pk)) ≥ ρk(t) where ρk(t) tends to zero when t grows.
If all players k ∈ A accept the offer, the game ends.
• At the beginning we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before.
• If there is no more offer left from P, the default offer ˜P will be chosen. 
Moreover there exists T such that for all t ≥ T, ρk(t) = 0.
One can show exactly as in Lemma 1 that protocol P2 has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium.
This game is clearly finite since P is finite and each offer can only be proposed once.
• At the beginning, we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before.
• If there is no more offer left from P, the default offer ˜P will be chosen.
We end the proof by using a  classical result stating that any finite game in extensive form with perfect information has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium (see e.g.
Note that P is determined using all players general constraints on the proposals and Q.
• If there is no more offer left from P, the default offer ˜P will be chosen.
The  utility/preference function of a player k ∈ A ∪ {a} is Uk,  defined using MYRIAD, as presented in Section 4, with a set Nk of criteria, Xk an option, and so on.
• Wait that all players of A give their opinion Yes or No to the player a.
Finally P1 corresponds to a game with perfect information.
Protocol P1 has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium 1 .
• Wait that all players of A give their opinion Yes or No to the player a.
• The utility of players regarding a given  offer decreases over time.
The threshold  decreases over time so that players have to make more and more concession.
(δk)t or ft(x) = x − δk.t, as penalty  function.
Finally offer P2 is  chosen.
To this end, one shall specify the order in which the responders A react to the offer P of a.
, m} and a player a are negotiating over a set Q of size q.
To sum up, the worse preferred options have to be proposed first in order to get finally the best one.
More precisely if the utility of a player is larger than a given threshold then acceptance is required.
Moreover, let ˜P denote a particular proposal defined as a"s preferred proposal.
However the order in which the players answer has no influence on the course of the game and in particular on their personal  utility.
Formally, we consider negotiations where a set of  players A = {1, 2, .
The player a is the protocol  mediator, the mediator agent of the agentification.
Therefore, the protocol becomes as  follows.
It could be seen as a better solution as a consensus among the agents.
The Sixth Intl.
Otherwise t is incremented and we go back to previous point.
Otherwise t is incremented and we go back to previous point.
Otherwise t is incremented and we go back to previous point.
We have P ∈ P where P is the set of admissible proposals, a finite set.
Consider an example with A = {1, 2} and P = {P1 , P2 , P3 } where the default offer is P1 .
Therefore, our negotiation protocol can be as follows: Protocol P1.
Proof : Protocol P1 is first transformed in a game in  extensive form.
Option P3 seems more balanced since no player judges it badly.

But this entails a waste of time.
