We have already developed a first MAS, in particular  integrating MYRIAD, to test this protocol in order to know more about its efficiency in terms of solution quality and quickness in finding a consensus.
The first main contribution is that we take into account complex inter-dependencies between multiple issues with the use of a complex preference modelling.
Our second contribution is the use of sharp  recommendations in the protocol to help in accelerating the search of a consensus between the cooperative agents and in finding an optimal solution.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 949 the two types of recommendations and by adding a  preference model to the mediator of our system.
Moreover, a comparative study has to be done in order to evaluate the performance of our framework against the existing ones and against some variations on the protocol. 
This contribution is  reinforced by the use of multi-issue negotiation in a multilateral context.
This prototype enabled us to solve some examples with our approach and the  results we obtained are encouraging since we obtained quickly good agreements, close to the Pareto solution, in the light of the initial constraints of the problem: the availabilities.
This paper presents a new protocol to address  multilateral multi-issue negotiation in a cooperative context.
We still have to improve our MAS by taking into account The Sixth Intl.
Moreover, we tested this protocol in a crisis management context where the  negotiation aim is where to evacuate a whole set of injured people to predefined hospitals.
We have also shown that the protocol has subgame perfect equilibria and these equilibria converge to the usual maximum solution.
