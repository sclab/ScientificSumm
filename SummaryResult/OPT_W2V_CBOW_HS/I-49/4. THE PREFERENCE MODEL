The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , .
All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the  introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].
In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts  substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].
Hk on some criteria C ⊆ Nk as follows ωC (Hk, x)= Z 1 0 Hk ` (1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\C ´ − Hk(x) EC (τ, x) dτ where ((1−τ)xC +τ, xNk\C ) is the compound act that equals (1 − τ)xi + τ if i ∈ C and equals xi if i ∈ Nk \ C. Moreover, EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\C ).
These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are  negotiated.

The [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes.
Then the overall assessment of x is given by Uk(x) = Hk(uk 1 (x1), .
In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria  decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between  versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].
We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, .
Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i  conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones.
We generally assume that EC is of order 1, that is EC (τ, x) = τ P i∈C (1 − xi).
The agent is then recommended to improve of coalition C for which ωC (Hk, x) is maximum.
These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.
An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, .
The expression of ωC (Hk, x) when Hk is a Choquet integral, is given in [11].
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch  between the hospitals.
, nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.
The overall preference relation over Xk is then x y ⇐⇒ Uk(x) ≥ Uk(y) .
Function ωC (Hk, x) depicts the  average improvement of Hk when the criteria of coalition A range from xC to 1C divided by the average effort needed for this improvement.
, uh nk (xnk )) (1) where Hk : [0, 1]nk → [0, 1] is the aggregation function.
This recommendation is very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while not revealing their own preference model. 
A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].
In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t.
The two-additive Choquet integral is defined for (z1, .
The issues correspond directly or not to the decision criteria.

The score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j.
Assume that zi < zj.
