In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into  account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.
In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.
Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.
Our preference model, a  nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.
As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.
Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.
[10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.
4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are  considered in sect.
In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are  interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.
The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].
In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.
Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our  decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.
The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical  utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.
In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most  often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.
The preference modelling is described in sect.
Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.
In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.
Section 7 presents the formal modelling and  properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect.
This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and  Morgenstern.
Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an  evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.
To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt  almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving  independent issues.
In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis  management problem.
However, real-world negotiation problems  involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.
Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 
5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect.
We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.
When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.
