The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are  several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own  constraints and decision criteria.
In our  context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to  negotiate together.
This implies the use of a negotiation protocol  encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.
Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one  another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.
Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.
Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also  enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria.
The  conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.
Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.
All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.
To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several  issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit,  medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.
Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a  distributed decision making process.
Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.
The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.
• A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue  negotiation protocol. 
Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least,  distribution features and reasoning capabilities.
