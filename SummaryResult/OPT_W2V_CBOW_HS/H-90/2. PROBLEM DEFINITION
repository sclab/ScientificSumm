But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the user"s current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.
The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a user"s education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough  information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.
In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.
Therefore for the current query Qk  (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the  preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.
The  clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.
Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit  feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.
In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.
Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually  relevant to the user"s information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is  attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the user"s  information need.
In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different  session.
There are two kinds of context information we can use for  implicit feedback.
Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text  information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.
Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.
We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.
Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.
During interactions, the user would  continuously modify the query.
One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a user"s current  information need in a single session.
Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.
The category of a user"s information need (e.g., kids or sports),  previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.
We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.
For example, a user would  presumably frequently click some documents to view.
In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 
A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.
Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving  retrieval accuracy.
In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].
In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.
In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.
Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.
Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough  information [11, 17].
