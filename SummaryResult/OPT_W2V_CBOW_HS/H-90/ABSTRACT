In this paper, we study how to  exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an  interactive information retrieval setting.
We propose several  contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.
A major limitation of most existing retrieval models and systems is that the retrieval decision is made based solely on the query and document collection; information about the actual user and search context is largely ignored.
Experiment results show that using implicit feedback,  especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval  performance substantially.

We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.
