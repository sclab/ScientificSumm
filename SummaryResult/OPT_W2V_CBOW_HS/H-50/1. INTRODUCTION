Several studies argued that rank aggregation has the  potential of combining effectively all the various sources of  evidence considered in various input methods.
Rank aggregation approaches, also called data fusion  approaches, consist in combining these result lists in order to produce a new and hopefully better ranking.
The result lists produced by these approaches depend on the  exact definition of the relevance concept.
The rank aggregation problem was addressed in various fields such as i) in social choice theory which studies  voting algorithms which specify winners of elections or winners of competitions in tournaments [29], ii) in statistics when studying correlation between rankings, iii) in distributed databases when results from different databases must be combined [12], and iv) in collaborative filtering [23].
Data fusion is also relevant in other contexts, such as when the user writes several queries of his/her information need (e.g., a boolean query and a natural language query) [4], or when many document surrogates are available [16].
We consider, in the following, cases where only ranks are available and no other additional information is provided such as the relevance scores.
These methods also tend to smooth out biases of the input  methods according to Montague and Aslam [22].
For instance, experiments carried out in [16], [30], [4] and [19] showed that documents which appear in the lists of the majority of the input methods are more likely to be relevant.
Most current rank aggregation methods consider each  input ranking as a permutation over the same set of items.
In Section 4, we present a new aggregation method which is proven to best fit the IR context.
We first review current rank aggregation methods in Section 2.
Moreover, Lee [19] and Vogt and Cottrell [31] found that various retrieval approaches often return very different irrelevant documents, but many of the same relevant documents.
They also give rigid interpretation to the exact ranking of the items.
those of the input methods, even when some of them have weak individual performances.
Data fusion has recently been proved to improve performances for both the ad-hoc retrieval and categorization tasks within the TREC genomics track in 2005 [1].
[2]) in order to  retrieve relevant documents in response to a user request.
[3] also found that rank aggregation methods improve the performances w.r.t.
Then we outline the specificities of the data fusion problem in the IR context (Section 3).
Such  approaches give rise to metasearch engines in the Web context.
Both of these assumptions are rather not valid in the IR context, as will be shown in the following sections.
A wide range of current Information Retrieval (IR)  approaches are based on various search models (Boolean,  Vector Space, Probabilistic, Language, etc.
This corresponds indeed to the reality, where only ordinal information is available.
Experimental results are presented in Section 5 and conclusions are provided in a final section. 
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.
