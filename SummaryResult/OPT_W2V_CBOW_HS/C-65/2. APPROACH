A hybrid sensor fusion algorithm then estimates the trajectory, the range, the caliber and the weapon type based on all available observations.
The  wavefront has a conical shape, the angle of which depends on the Mach number, the speed of the bullet relative to the speed of sound.
The orientation of the microphone array at the time of detection is provided by a 3-axis digital compass.
The firing of a typical military rifle, such as the AK47 or M16, produces two distinct acoustic phenomena.
However, the sensorboards are also connected to COTS MICAz motes and they share their AoA and ToA measurements, as well as their own location and orientation, with each other using a multihop routing service [9].
If both the shockwave and muzzle blast AoA are available, a simple analytical solution gives the shooter location as shown in Section 6.
If at least three acoustic channels detect the same event, its AoA is also computed.
However, the accuracy of GPS is a few meters degrading the Figure 1: Acoustic sensorboard/mote assembly .
The shockwave has a characteristic shape resembling a capital N. The rise time at both the start and end of the signal is very fast, under 1 μsec.
The sensorfusion  algorithm and the user interface get their data through one of these channels.
Our system is based on four microphones connected to a sensorboard.
Once a trajectory estimate is available, the shockwave length can be used for caliber estimation.
The supersonic projectile generates an acoustic shockwave, a kind of sonic boom.
As the microphones are close to each other, typically 2-4, we cannot expect very high precision.
The sensorboard is also Bluetooth capable for  communication with the soldier"s PDA or laptop computer.
The muzzle blast is generated at the muzzle of the gun and  travels at the speed sound.
Also, this method does not estimate a trajectory.
The latest generation sensorboard features a Texas Instruments CC-1000 radio enabling the high-precision radio interferometric self localization approach we have developed separately [7].
The length is determined by the caliber and the miss distance, the distance between the trajectory and the sensor.
The board detects shockwaves and muzzle blasts and measures their ToA.
In fact, an infinite number of trajectory-bullet speed pairs satisfy the observations.
Currently the system assumes that the soldier"s PDA is GPS-capable and it does not provide self localization service itself.
overall accuracy of the system.
However, we leave the integration of the two technologies for future work. 
A wired USB connection is also available.
It is typically a few hundred μsec.
Refer to Section 7 for an analysis.
