Due to the complex voltage requirements of the FPGA, the power supply circuitry is implemented on the  sensorboard and provides power both locally and to the mote.
These channels, featuring an electret microphone (Panasonic  WM64PNT), amplifiers with controllable gain (30-60 dB) and a 12-bit serial ADC (Analog Devices AD7476), reside on separate tiny boards which are connected to the main  sensorboard with ribbon cables.
The onboard Flash (4MB) and PSRAM (8MB) modules allow storing raw samples of several acoustic events, which can be used to build libraries of various acoustic  signatures and for refining the detection cores off-line.
Although rudimentary acoustic  signal processing can be done on these microcontroller-based boards, they do not provide the required computational performance for shockwave detection and angle of arrival measurements, where multiple signals from different  microphones need to be processed in parallel at a high sampling rate.
Also, the external memory blocks can store program code and data used by the soft processor cores on the FPGA.
The regulators-except the last one-can be turned on/off from the mote or through the Bluetooth radio (via GPIO lines) to save power.
An RS232 port and a Bluetooth (BlueGiga WT12) wireless link with virtual UART emulation are directly available on the board and provide simple means to connect the sensor to PCs and PDAs.
The integrated Honeywell HMR3300 digital compass  module provides heading, pitch and roll information with 1◦ accuracy, which is essential for calculating and combining directional estimates of the detected events.
The FPGA configuration (2.5 V) and a separate 3.3 V power net are fed by low current LDOs, the latter one is used to provide independent power to the mote and to the Bluetooth radio.
The sensorboard also supports full-speed USB transfers (with custom USB dongles) for uploading recorded audio samples to the PC.
The motes are equipped with IEEE 802.15.4  compliant radio transceivers and support ad-hoc wireless  networking among the nodes and to/from the base station.
This partitioning enables the use of truly different audio channels (eg.
Our 3rd generation sensorboard is designed to be used with MICAz motes-in fact it has almost the same size as the mote itself (see Figure 1).
The on-board JTAG chain-directly accessible through a dedicated connector-contains the FPGA part and configuration memory and provides in-system  programming and debugging facilities.
The board utilizes a powerful Xilinx XC3S1000 FPGA chip with various standard peripheral IP cores, multiple soft processor cores and custom logic for the acoustic detectors (Figure 2).
for precise time synchronization between the board and the mote).
The sensor platform offers a rich set of interfaces and can be integrated with existing systems in diverse ways.
The mote interface consists of an I2 C bus along with an interrupt and GPIO line (the latter one is used 114 Figure 2: Block diagram of the sensorboard.
We used a quad pack of rechargeable AA batteries as the power source (although any other configuration is viable that meets the voltage requirements).
Some of these nodes were mounted on military kevlar helmets with the microphones directly attached to the  surface at about 20 cm separation as shown in Figure 3(a).
The first prototype of our system employed 10 sensor nodes.
The board supports four independent analog channels  sampled at up to 1 MS/s (million samples per seconds).
Since the first static version of our system in 2003, the  sensor nodes have been built upon the UC Berkeley/Crossbow MICA product line [11].
The rest of the nodes were mounted in plastic enclosures  (Figure 3(b)) with the microphones placed near the corners of the boxes to form approximately 5 cm×10 cm rectangles. 
: slower sampling frequency, different gain or dynamic range) and also results in less noisy measurements by avoiding long analog signal paths.
The FPGA core (1.2 V) and I/O (3.3 V) voltages are generated by a highly efficient buck switching regulator.
