Note that a protocol module Ti, that has an interceptor bound to a service interface, is able to modify requests, replies and notifications.
In Figure 3, module Q1 contains an executer bound to service interface t and a listener bound to service interface u. Module Q1 can generate replies and notifications to service interface t and requests to service interface u.
A reply issued to a service interface is handled by one single listener.
The interceptor is bound to service interface t. The left part of the figure shows that an interceptor can be seen as an executer plus a listener.
Similarly, a dashed white arrow going from module Pi to service  interface si represents the fact that Pi can generate a reply or a notification to si.
In our service-based framework,  protocol modules in the same stack communicate through objects called service interfaces.
Upon replies and notifications, the order is  reversed. 
P1 Q1 P1 Q1 T1T1 t t t Figure 4: Execution of protocol interactions with interceptors An interceptor plays a special rË†ole.
A notification issued to a service interface si is handled by all listeners bound to si in the local stack.
Upon requests, if several interceptors are bound to the same service interface, they are executed in the order of binding.
The fact that a module Pi can generate a request to a service interface si is represented by a dashed black arrow going from Pi to si.
Note that the service interface nt allows to access the network.
In the right part of the figure, the interceptor of the protocol module T1 is represented by a rounded box.

They are activated each time a request, a reply or a notification is issued to the service interface they are bound to.
If the request and the reply occur respectively, in stack i and in stack j, the service interface si on i communicates to the service interface si on j the listener that must handle the reply.
We denote a service interface by a small letter (e.g.
A protocol module is a set of executers, listeners and interceptors.
To ensure that one single listener handles a reply, a module Pi has to identify, each time it issues a request, the listener to handle the possible reply.
FRAMEWORK In this section, we describe our new approach for  implementing and composing protocols that is based on services.
We represent executers with white boxes inside protocol modules and listeners with white boxes with a gray border.
Executers handle requests.
A request issued to a service interface si leads to the  execution of the executer bound to si.
A listener can be dynamically bound and unbound to/from a service  interface si.
Service Interface.
When module Q1 issues a reply or a notification, a similar mechanism is used, except that this time the listener-interceptor of T1 is executed.
692 We show in Section 5 the advantages of service-based  protocol frameworks over event-based protocol frameworks.
Protocol Modules.
Similarly to executers, interceptors can be dynamically bound or unbound to a  service interface.
Requests, replies and notifications are all issued to service interfaces.
Then, module T1 may forward a request req to the service interface t, where we can have req = req 1 .
An executer can be  dynamically bound to a service interface.
A connecting line between a service interface si and an executer e (resp.
It can be later unbound.
When P1 issues a request req to the service interface t, the executer-interceptor of T1 is executed.
Listeners handle replies and notifications.
If the listener that must handle the reply does not exist, the reply is delayed until the listener is created.
Contrary to events, at most one executer at any time can be bound to a service interface on every machine.
a listener l) shows that e (resp.
If no executer is bound to si, the request is delayed until some executer is bound to si.
l) is bound to si.

This is illustrated in Figure 4.
