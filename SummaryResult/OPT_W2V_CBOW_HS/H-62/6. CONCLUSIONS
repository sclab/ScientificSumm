Unlike most previous work, we emphasize the use of  immediate search context and implicit feedback information as well as eager updating of search results to maximally benefit a user.
In this paper, we studied how to exploit implicit user modeling to intelligently personalize information retrieval and improve search accuracy.
We further  propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately  preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.
The developed search agent thus can improve  existing web search performance without any additional effort from the user. 
Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent (UCAIR) on top of a popular search engine (Google).
Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.
We presented a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing  interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by  choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.
Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over 830 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 UCAIR prec@20 Googleprec@20 Scatterplot of Precision at Top 20 documents Figure 5: Precision at top 20 documents of UCAIR and Google 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 recall precision Precisionâˆ’Recall curves Google Result UCAIR Result Figure 6: Precision at top 20 result of UCAIR and Google Google.
