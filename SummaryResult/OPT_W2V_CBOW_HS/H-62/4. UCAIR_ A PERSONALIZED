If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.
For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.
In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.
In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.
Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document.
To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].
That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.
Currently, it is only  implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.
The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.

Table 1: Sample results of query expansion 
Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query.
Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g.
The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.
4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.
This way, the captured user information always resides on the  computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.
Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.
Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries.
4.2 Session boundary detection and query  expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two  adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect  session boundaries).
(2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary.
In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.
According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].
5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.
As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major  components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a user"s search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries.
Client-side personalization also  allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.
(3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.
(3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.
To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries  (typically 50 results).
We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to  calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would  significantly slow down the process.
, sn} be the result sets for the two queries.
Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.
UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.
(2) The query modification module selectively  improves the query formulation according to the current user model.
5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results.
Since our  clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make  session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.
SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.
4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.
Furthermore, performing  personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the  serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.
Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.
We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).
We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to  compute a term weight vector si for each result si.
We define the  average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + .
For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.
Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses  statistical information rather than textual features.
For example, for the above queries java island and travel  Indonesia", the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries" search results, yielding a high similarity score.
The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as  personalized search.
Since implicit feedback is not completely  reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g.
Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.
Below we describe our algorithms for each of them.
In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.
