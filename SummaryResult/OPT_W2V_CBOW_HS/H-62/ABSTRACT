We develop an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that can perform eager implicit feedback, e.g., query  expansion based on previous queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information.
A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user  modeling and are not adaptive to individual users, resulting in inherently non-optimal retrieval performance.
In this paper, we study how to infer a user"s interest from the user"s search context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized search .
Information retrieval systems (e.g., web search engines) are  critical for overcoming information overload.
Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over the popular Google search engine.
Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models,  Relevance feedback, Search Process General Terms Algorithms 
We present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit user modeling in information retrieval.
For example, a tourist and a programmer may use the same word java to search for different information, but the current search systems would return the same results.
