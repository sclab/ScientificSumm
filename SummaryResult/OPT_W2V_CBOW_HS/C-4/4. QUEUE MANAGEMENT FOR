Then, with a+, = a-1 = a,~, and  considering that the resulting service has to be best effort in the long term, we have: aopo + a+lp+l + LIP-1 A ape Qlll@+l fP-1) = (a--oo)m P - l = zpo-p+1 (5) Due to this relationship between the drop probability for +l and -1 packets, we designate this queue  management algorithm as Differential RED (DiERED).
If the ratio of +l to -1 packets at a gateway is not 1 (either due to  misbehaving flows or a significant number of flows which have already experienced loss at earlier hops) the -1 loss prob ability is decreased and the +l probability is increased at the same time thus degrading the service for all users.
As it should be avoided to introduce reordering of the packets of a flow in the network we consider mechanisms for the management of a single queue with different priority levels.
RIO has been designed to decrease the clip seen by particular Bows at the expense of other flows.
This is due to the potentially missing  correlation of the computed aug value between consecutive +l and -1 arrivals, especially when the share of the FT traftic is low.
The necessary relationship between the drop probabilities for packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85  follows (note that this relationship is valid both at the  end-tend level and every individual hop): Let a = a0 + a+, +a-~ be the overall number of emitted packets by an FT flow and a,, + E [-l,O, +l] be the number of packets belonging to a certain class (where the 0 class corresponds to (unmarked) best effort traflic).
In this work, however, we want to keep the ulp as given by other parameters while  modifying the loss distribution for the foreground traffic (FT).
With RIO, two average queue sizes as congestion  indicators are computed: one just for the IN (high priority) packets and another for both IN and OUT (low priority) packets.
Due to the condition of a+, = (I-L = all, in addition to the  conventional RED behaviour, the DiffRED implementation should also monitor the +l and -1 arrival processes.
In [13] it has been shown that using only the conventional RED average queue size avg for DSRED operation is not sufficient.
Packets marked as OUT are dropped earlier (in terms of the average queue size) than IN packets.
One approach to realize inter-flow service  differentiation using a single queue is RIO (‘RED with IN and OUT", [3]).
INTRAFLOW LOSS CONTROL While we have highlighted the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to the distribution of loss in the last sections, we now want to briefly introduce a queue management mechanism ([13]) which is able to enforce the relative preferences of the ap plication with regard to loss.
This amounts to trading the loss of a +l packet against a -1 packet of the same flow (in a statistical sense).
Thus, a service differentiation for foreground  traffic is possible which does not differ from conventional RED behaviour in the long term average (i.e., in the ulp). 
10) show the operating area when this correction is added.
Packet marking, in addition to keeping the desirable property of state aggregration within the network core as proposed by the IETF Differentiated Services architecture, is exploited here to convey the intrbflow requirements of a llow.
10 shows the conventional RED drop probability curve (po as a function of the average queue size for all arrivals avg), which is applied to all unmarked (0) traffic (background traffic: BT).
As this might result in a unfair distribution of losses between the FT and BT fractions, a specific avgl value is computed by sampling the queue size only at FT arrival instants.
Figure 10 shows the corresponding drop probability curves.
We consider flows with packets marked with +l and  ‘I1 (as described in the introduction) BS foreground traffic (FT) and other (best effort) flows as backaound traffic (BT).
