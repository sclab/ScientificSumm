Contrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the concealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break at transitions within the speech signal however, thus  showing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.
We have then developed intraflow loss recovery and control mechanisms to increase the  perceptual quality.
Such schemes can  better accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are difficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity of both the codec and the redundancy generator.
This is the case because they neither need the addition of redundancy nor feedback (which would incur additional data and delay overhead) and thus yield stable voice quality also for higher loss rates due to absence of FEC and feedback loss.
Thus, combined intra-flow end-to-end / hopby-hop schemes seem to be well-suited for heavily-loaded networks with a  relatively large fraction of voice traffic.
Frame-based codecs amplify on one hand the impact of loss by error  propagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.
While we have tested other codecs only  informally, we think that our results reflect the fundamental  difference between codecs which either encode the speech  waveâ€˜We also used the G.729 encoder for the redundant source coding.
We have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm which is able to control loss patterns without changing the amount of loss and characterized its performance for the loss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity.
With loss concealment, however, the speech quality is increased but the amount of increase exhibits strong temporal sensitivity.
We have found that the selective marking scheme performs almost as good as the protection of the  entire flow at a significantly lower number of necessary  highpriority packets.
Our work has clearly focused on linking simple end-to-end models which can be easily parametrized with the known characteristic of  hopby-hop loss control to user-level metrics.
For PCM without loss concealment we have found that it  neither exhibits significant temporal sensitivity nor sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.
Also, it is useful for adaptive codecs running at the lowest possible bitrate.
In this paper we have characterized the behaviour of a  samplebased codec (PCM) and a frame-based codec (G.729) in the presence of packet loss.
The  SPBDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority  packets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the decoder"s concealment for other frames.
Then we developed a new packet marking scheme called Speech Property-Based Selective Differential Packet Marking for an efficient protection of frame-based codecs.
Avoiding redundancy and feedback is also  interesting in multicast conferencing scenarios where the end-to-end loss characteristics of the different paths leading to members of the session are largely different.
We have also evaluated the mapping of an end-to-end algorithm to  interflow protection.
An analysis of a large scale deployment of non-adaptive or adaptive FEC as compared to a deployment of our combined scheme requires clearly further study.
