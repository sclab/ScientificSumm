In a negotiation setting, the two typical design goals would be: • Efficiency: Avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal; and • Fairness: Avoid agreements that give the most of the gains to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little.
The mediator needs to determine how much utility it needs to take away from the other negotiators to give a particular negotiator a specific gain G (in utility).
Informally, the problem faced by both the mediator and the  negotiators is construction of the indifference curves.
In order to search for integrative solutions within the outcome space O, we characterise the relationship between the agents over the set of attributes Att.
• To the negotiators, knowing the options available along  indifference curves opens up opportunities to reach more  efficient outcomes.
The result of this step would be a subset of outcomes that contains the Pareto-optimal set.
The optimal solution to this problem scenario is to assign task T to agent B and to allocate 20 units of resource R (i.e., the maximal amount of resource R required by agent B) from agent A to agent B.
Note that this problem is  essentially the problem of searching for joint gains in a multilateral negotiation in which the involved parties hold strategic information, i.e., the integrative part in a negotiation.
negotiating agents, we discuss the properties of the solution  outcomes to be achieved by the mediator.
Denote by ¯S the set Att \ S. Assume that vS and vS are two assignments of values to the attributes of S and v1 ¯S, v2 ¯S are two arbitrary value  assignments to the attributes of ¯S, then (ui([vS, v1 ¯S]) − ui([vS, v2 ¯S])) = (ui([vS, v1 ¯S])−ui([vS, v2 ¯S])).
This approach will not work unless the attributes from Att 3 The Pareto-optimal set is the set of outcomes whose consequences (in the consequence space) correspond to the Pareto frontier.
However, as the agents still have to bargain over the amount of money transfer p, neither agent would be willing to disclose their respective costs and revenues regarding the task T and the resource R. As a consequence, agents often do not achieve the optimal  outcome presented above in practice.
In the first steps, the more manageable attributes will be solved.
For instance, consider an agent A who is presenting his opponent with an offer θA which she refuses to accept.
That is, the revenues  generated for A exceeds the costs incurred to B to do task T, and B values resource R more highly than the cost for A to provide it.
Our methods allow the agents to repeatedly interact with the mediator so that a Nash solution outcome could be found by the parties.
In other words, the presented outcome is Pareto-efficient and should be part of the solution outcome for this problem scenario.
As the agents hold different objectives and have different capacities, it may be the case that changing between two values of a specific attribute implies different shifts in utility of the agents.
Essentially, Nash advocates for the following properties to be satisfied by solution to the bilateral  negotiation problem: (i) it produces only Pareto-optimal outcomes; (ii) it is invariant to affine transformation (to the consequence space); (iii) it is symmetric; and (iv) it is independent from irrelevant  alternatives.
To address this issue, we  introduce a mediator to help the agents discover better agreements than the ones they might try to settle on.
These are attributes that take a finite set of values.
The issues faced by the mediator are: (i) the mediator requires access to the negotiators" utility functions, and (ii)  making (fair) tradeoffs between different agents" utilities.
[17]) assume that the attributes or the issues are  independent, resulting in an additive value function for each agent.4 ASSUMPTION 1.
In other words, the outcome θA is more efficient than θA to these two negotiators.
To him, θA and θA are indifferent but θA could give some gains to B and thus will be more acceptable to B.
It then turns out that, by taking the negotiators" utilities as its objectives the mediator itself faces a multi-criteria decision making problem.

That is, the utility function of agent i will be defined on the attributes from S independently of any value assignment to other attributes. 
• To the mediator, constructing indifference curves requires a measure of fairness between the negotiators.
In the second step, we employ an iterative  procedure that allows the mediator to interact with the negotiators to find joint improvements that move towards a Pareto-optimal  outcome.
Rather than having to concede, A could look at his indifference curve going through θA and choose another proposal θA.
Our approach is thus to solve this optimisation problem in two steps.
This outcome regarding the resource and task allocation  problems leaves payoffs of $10 to agent A and $100 to agent B.2 Any other outcome would leave at least one of the agents worse off.
In order to help facilitate this process, we introduce the role of a neutral mediator.
However, the problem of finding the exact  Paretooptimal set3 is NP-hard [2].
Before formalising the decision problems faced by the mediator and the 2 Certainly, without money transfer to compensate agent A, this outcome is not a fair one.
A solution satisfying Nash"s axioms is called a Nash bargaining solution.
The above goals are axiomatised in Nash"s seminal work [16] on cooperative negotiation games.
Why are the indifference curves so important?
Most works on multi-attribute, or multi-issue,  negotiation (e.g.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) are independent.
