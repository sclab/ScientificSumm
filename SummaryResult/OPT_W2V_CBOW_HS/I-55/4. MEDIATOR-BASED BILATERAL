Note that when xh is an interior point of Oc then the  situation is symmetric for the two agents 1 and 2, and the mediator has the choice of either finding a point on IC1(xh) to  improve the utility of agent 2, or finding a point on IC2(xh) to improve the utility of agent 1.
Under the assumption that the parties" utility functions ui are differentiable concave, the set of all directions of improvement for a party at a point o can be defined in terms of his most preferred, or gradient, direction at that point.
When it isn"t possible to obtain a  compromise direction for joint improvements at a point x ∈ Oc either because the compromise vector points to the space outside of the feasible set Oc or because the two parties are in local strong  opposition at x, we will consider to move along the indifference curve of one party while trying to improve the utility of the other party.
That is, we will be searching for a point on the indifference curve of agent i, ICi(xh), while trying to improve the utility of agent j.
We further assume that the set O = ×j∈AttV alj of feasible outcomes is defined by constraints that all parties must obey and O is convex.
Assume that a tentative agreement (which is a point x ∈ Rk ) is currently on the table, the process for the agents to jointly improve this agreement in order to reach a Pareto-optimal agreement can be described as follows.
Once an (approximate) Pareto-optimal set is generated, it is left to the negotiators to decide which of the generated Pareto-optimal outcomes to be chosen as the final settlement.
Given a negotiation framework, if for every agent the set of simple attributes doesn"t contain a strongly dominant  attribute, then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the  negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes.
Now, how does the mediator determine the optimal values for the attributes in Simp?
If agent 1 misrepresents his utility function to the mediator by reporting utility 0 for all values A, B and C and utility 1 for value D then the agent 2 who plays honestly in his report to the mediator will obtain the worst outcome D given any of the above solutions.
Otherwise, among the four vectors ISσ i (xh), i = 1, 2 and σ = +/−, the mediator chooses the vector that (i) is bounded in Oc , and (ii) is closest to the gradient of the other agent, ∇uj (xh)(j = i).
If the two parties are in (local) weak opposition at the current tentative agreement xh, i.e., their improving directions at xh are close to each other, then the  compromise direction proposed by Ehtamo et al [4] is likely to point to a better agreement for both agents.
Thus, the optimal values are the solution of the following  optimisation problem: arg max v∈V alSimp min i∈N ui(v) The question now is of course whether a negotiator has the  incentive to misrepresent his utility function.
Given a negotiation framework, under the  minimax solution, if the negotiators are uncertain about their  opponents" preferences then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes.
(4) Given the current tentative agreement xh (h ≥ 0), the mediator has to choose a point xh+1 along d = T(xh) so that all parties gain.
The parties are in local strict opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff for all points x ∈ Rm that are  sufficiently close to x (i.e., for some > 0 such that ∀x x −x < ), an increase of one utility can be achieved only at the expense of a decrease of the other utility.
As attributes are independent of each other regarding the agents" utility functions, the optimisation problem over the attributes from Simp can be carried out by fixing ui([vSimp]) to a constant C, and then search for the optimal values within the set of attributes Simp.
Since opposition between the two parties can vary considerably over the outcome space (with one pair of outcomes considered highly antagonistic and another pair being highly cooperative), we need to describe the local properties of the relationship.
Essentially, the mechanism to avoid an agent to understate his utility regarding particular outcomes is to  guarantee a certain measure of fairness for the final settlement.
However, as most negotiations involve only discrete  issues with a bounded number of options, we will assume that each attribute takes values either from a finite set or from the set of real numbers R. In the rest of the paper, we will refer to attributes whose values are from finite sets as simple attributes and attributes whose values are from R as continuous attributes.
Thus, the sought  after point xh+1 can be generated by first finding a point yh along the direction of T G(xh) and then move from yh to the same direction of ∇ui(xh) until we intersect with ICi(xh).
On the other hand, if o is not the most preferred outcome to i then by  overstating the utility he assigns to o, the agent i runs the risk of having to settle on an agreement which would give him less payoffs than he is supposed to receive.
That is, even when there is only one single simple attribute, if an agent is uncertain whether the other agent"s most preferred  resolution is also his own most preferred resolution then he should opt for truth-telling as the optimal strategy.
In other words, under global strict opposition the outcome space O can be flattened out into a single line such that for each pair of outcomes x, y ∈ O, u1(x) < u1(y) iff u2(x) > u2(y), i.e., at every point in O, the gradient of the two utility functions point to two different ends of the line.
However, if the two parties are in local strong opposition at the current point xh then it"s unclear whether the compromise direction would really not hurt one of the agents whilst bringing some benefit to the other.
Note that, due to Assumption 1, agent i"s The Sixth Intl.
Note that agent 1 doesn"t need to know agent 2"s utility function, nor does he need to know the strategy employed by agent 2.
An alternative x∗ ∈ Oc is efficient iff, either A. x∗ is in the interior of Oc and the parties are in local strict  opposition at x∗ , i.e., ∇u1(x∗ ) = −γ∇u2(x∗ ) (2) where γ > 0; or B. x∗ is on the boundary of Oc , and for some α, β ≥ 0: α∇u1(x∗ ) + β∇u2(x∗ ) = ∇B(x∗ ) (3) We are now interested in answering the following questions: (i) What is the initial tentative agreement x0?
We denote the number of continuous attributes by k, i.e., Att = Simp ∪ Simp and |Simp| = k. Then, the outcome space O can be represented as follows: O = ( Q j∈Simp V alj) × ( Q l∈Simp V all), where Q l∈Simp V all ⊆ Rk is the continuous component of O.
The notions of local oppositions, i.e., strict, nonstrict, weak and strong, are not  applicable to outcome spaces that contain simple attributes and nor are the notions of global weak and strong oppositions.
Note also that the two vectors ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x) define a hyperplane, denoted by h∇(x), in the  kdimensional space Rk .
Recall that, by Assumption 1, we can characterise agent i"s utility function as follows: ui([v∗ Simp, vSimp]) = C + wi 2 ∗ ui,2([vSimp]), where C is the constant wi 1 ∗ ui,1([v∗ Simp]) and v∗ Simp denotes the optimal values of the simple attributes in Simp.
∇u2(x) ) From Definition 2, it is obvious that the two parties are in local strict opposition (at x) iff θ(x) = π, and they are in local strong opposition iff π ≥ θ(x) > π/2, and they are in local weak  opposition iff π/2 ≥ θ(x) ≥ 0.
Given an outcome space O, the parties are in global strict opposition iff ∀x, y ∈ O, u1(x) < u1(y) iff u2(x) > u2(y).
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 513 4.2.2 Computing new tentative agreement Our procedure is a combination of the method of jointly  improving direction introduced by Ehtamo et al [4] and a method we  propose in the coming section.
Note that the closed set Oc contains two disjoint subsets: Oc = Oc 0 ∪Oc B , where Oc 0 denotes the set of interior points of Oc and Oc B denotes the boundary of Oc .
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 511 utility function can be characterised as follows: ui([vSimp, vSimp]) = wi 1 ∗ ui,1([vSimp]) + wi 2 ∗ ui,2([vSimp]), where Simp = Att \ Simp, and ui,1 and ui,2 are the utility  components of ui over the sets of attributes Simp and Simp, respectively, and 0 < wi 1, wi 2 < 1 and wi 1 + wi 2 = 1.
That is, we are searching for points x within the feasible set Oc such that moving to x from the current tentative agreement x brings more gains to at least one of the agents while not hurting any of the agents.
Accordingly we will also take the set of outcomes under consideration by the agents to be the feasible set Oc .
at certain point within the feasible set Oc , the gradient direction of their own utility functions and some  section of their respective indifference curves.
Essentially, under global strict opposition the whole outcome space O becomes the Pareto-optimal set as at no point in O can the  negotiating parties make a joint improvement, i.e., every point in O is a Pareto-efficient outcome.
As 5 Let S be the set of alternatives, x∗ is weakly Pareto optimal if there is no x ∈ S such that ui(x) > ui(x∗ ) for all agents i. the mediator does not know the indifference curves of the parties, he has to use the tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves of the parties at point x.
We again appeal to the Assumption 1 on additivity of utility functions to achieve a measure of fairness within this negotiation setting.
Intuitively, if most of an agent"s utility concentrates on one of the attributes then this attribute strongly dominates other attributes.
Thus, the agents have no incentive to overstate their utility  regarding an outcome o: If o is the most preferred outcome to an agent i then he already assigns the maximal utility to o.
That is, the agents lose the incentive to be dishonest to obtain gains from taking advantage of the known solutions to determine the  settlement outcome for they would be offset by the fairness maintenance mechanism.
4.1 Optimisation on simple attributes In order to extract the optimal values for a subset of attributes, in the first step of this optimisation process the mediator requests the negotiators to submit their respective utility functions over the set of simple attributes.
Let POSet ⊆ V alSimp be the Pareto-optimal subset of the simple outcomes, the minimax solution is defined to be the solution of the following optimisation problem.
For each attribute j ∈ Simp, an agent i will be asked to discretely submit three values (from the set V alj): the most preferred value, denoted by pvi,j, the least preferred value, denoted by wvi,j, and a value that gives i an approximately  average payoff, denoted by avi,j.
Intuitively, global strict opposition implies that there is no way to obtain joint improvements for both agents.
As a consequence, the negotiation degenerates to a distributive negotiation, i.e., the  negotiating parties should try to claim as much shares from the  negotiation issues as possible while the mediator should aim for the  fairness of the division.
The parties are in local non-strict opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff they are not in local strict opposition at x, i.e., iff it is possible for both parties to raise their utilities by moving an infinitesimal distance from x.
If 1 ≥ ∇u1(xh).∇u2(xh) > 0 and the vector T BS (xh) is bounded in Oc then the mediator chooses the compromise improving direction d = T BS (xh) and apply the method described by Ehtamo et al [4] to generate the next tentative agreement xh+1.
By performing the above procedure on  every attribute j ∈ Simp, we are able to identify the initial tentative agreement x0 such that x0 ∈ Oc .
Hence, without loss of generality (albeit with a blatant abuse of notation), we can take the agent i"s utility function as ui : Rk → [0, 1].
On the other hand, stronger opposition  suggests that the negotiating parties tend to behave strategically  leading to misrepresentation of their respective objectives and utility functions and making joint gains more difficult to realise.
Now, the point xh+1 to be  generated lies somewhere on the intersection of ICi(xh) and the hyperplane defined by ∇ui(xh) and T G(xh).
The Sixth Intl.
Furthermore, there are two indifference curves of agents 1 and 2 going through point x, denoted by IC1(x) and IC2(x), respectively.
The parties are in global strict (nonstrict, weak, strong)  opposition iff for every x ∈ Rm they are in local strict  (nonstrict, weak, strong) opposition.
The above questions can be answered by looking at the directions of improvement of the negotiating parties at o, i.e., the directions in the outcome space O into which their utilities increase at point o.
For instance, if the initial tentative  agreement x0 is chosen to be the most preferred alternative to one of the agents then it is also a Pareto-optimal outcome, making it  impossible to find any joint improvement from x0.
Then, the questions are: (i) from the point of view of an agent i, is o already the best outcome for i?
The following theorem shows that if the set of attributes Simp does not contain a strongly dominant attribute then the negotiators have no incentive to be dishonest.
However, their goal is to approximate the Pareto-optimal set by  systematically choosing a set of reference points.
(ii) if o is not the best outcome for i then is there another outcome o such that o gives i a better utility than o and o does not cause a utility loss to the other agent j in comparison to o?
For the case of two-party negotiations, the following bisecting function, denoted by T BS , can be defined over the interior set of Oc .
To decide on which choice to make, the mediator has to compute the distribution of gains throughout the whole process to avoid giving more gains to one agent than to the other.
However, the  notions of global strict and nonstrict oppositions can be generalised for outcome spaces that contain simple attributes.
Thus, the optimal values are the solution of the following optimisation problem: arg max v∈V alSimp X i∈N ui(v) • The Nash solution: The product of the agents" utilities are maximised.
The mediator asks the negotiators to discretely submit their respective gradient directions at x, i.e., ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x).
Note that the goal of the process to be described here is to search for agreements that are more efficient than the tentative agreement currently on the table.
This can be seen most  easily in negotiations involving two negotiators; during the  distributive phase of the negotiation, the two negotiators"s objectives are directly opposing each other.
First of all, recall that the agents" utility functions are bounded, i.e., ∀o ∈ O.0 ≤ ui(o) ≤ 1.
The parties are in local weak opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff ∇u1(x).∇u2(x) ≥ 0, i.e., iff the gradients at x of the two utility functions form an acute or right angle.
On the other hand, global nonstrict opposition allows room for joint improvements and all parties might be better off trying to realise the potential gains by reaching Pareto-efficient agreements.
Note that given a line L(x) going through the point x, there are two (unit) vectors from x along L(x) pointing to two opposite directions,  denoted by L+ (x) and L− (x).
Ehtamo et al then define a mechanism to generate a sequence of points and prove that when the generated sequence is bounded and when all generated points (from the sequence) belong to the interior set Oc 0 then the sequence converges to a weakly  Paretooptimal agreement [4, pp.
the set of simple attributes Simp.
As long as he knows that the mediator is going to employ one of the above three solutions, then the above misrepresentation is the dominant strategy for this game.
The value whose the two valuations of two agents are closest is selected as the initial value for the attribute j as part of the initial tentative agreement.
We begin with the opposition at any point of the outcome space Rm .
If pv1,j and pv2,j are sufficiently close, i.e., |pv1,j − pv2,j| < Δ for some pre-defined Δ > 0, then pv1,j and pv2,j are chosen to be the two core values,  denoted by cv1 and cv2.
Mathematically, let ζ and ξ denote the vectors T G(xh) and ∇ui(xh), respectively, xh+1 is the solution to the following optimisation problem: max λ1,λ2∈L uj(xh + λ1ζ + λ2ξ) s.t.
When the gradient direction ∇ui(o) of agent i at point o is outright opposing to the gradient direction ∇uj (o) of agent j at point o then the two parties strongly disagree at o and no joint improvements can be achieved for i and j in the locality surrounding o.
We of course have to define clearly what it means for an attribute to strongly dominate other attributes.
Basically, the idea is to see how strong the opposition the parties are in.
Several well-known optimisation  strategies could be applicable here: • The utilitarian solution: The sum of the agents" utilities are maximised.
Assuming for the moment that all attributes from Att take values from the set of real numbers R, i.e., V alj ⊆ R for all j ∈ Att.
Improving a given tentative agreement to yield a Pareto-optimal agreement is  considered in the next section.
To start, the mediator asks the negotiators for their gradients ∇u1(xh) and ∇u2(xh), respectively, at xh.
We will now formally characterise this relationship between negotiators by defining the opposition  between two negotiating parties.
If the sequence of agreements generated by the above method is bounded then the method converges to a point x∗ ∈ Oc that is weakly Pareto optimal. 
Thus, it"s important that the choice of the initial tentative agreement be sensibly made.
A fair framework does not only support a more satisfactory distribution of utility among the agents, but also often a good measure to prevent misrepresentation of  private information by the agents.
the feasible set Oc is bounded, the conditions for an alternative x ∈ Oc to be efficient vary depending on the position of x.
When Simp contains one single attributes, the agents have the incentive to understate their utility functions regarding outcomes that are not attractive to them.
If xh is a Pareto-optimal outcome according to equation 2 or equation 3, then the process is terminated.
Similarly, we obtain cv2 from the two values pv2,j and av2,j.
The parties are in local strong opposition at a point x ∈ Rm iff ∇u1(x).∇u2(x) < 0, i.e., iff the gradients at x form an obtuse angle.
The next step is to compute a new tentative agreement from an existing tentative agreement so that the new one would be more efficient than the existing one.
The weaker the opposition, the more potential gains can be realised making cooperation the better strategy to employ during negotiation.
The negotiators" utility functions can be  described by continuously differentiable and concave functions ui : Rk → [0, 1], (i = 1, 2).
Thus, we reduce the original problem to the problem of searching for  optimal (and fair) outcomes within the feasible set Oc .
Let hT1(x) and hT2(x) denote the  tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves IC1(x) and IC2(x), respectively, at point x.
However, when the set Simp contains more than one attribute and none of the attributes strongly dominate the other attributes then the above problem disminishes by itself thanks to the  integrative solution.
Ehtamo et al define a a function T(x) that describes the mediator"s choice for a compromise direction at x.
We, on the other hand, are interested in a fair initial tentative agreement which is not necessarily efficient.
arg min v∈P OSet max i∈N ui(v) While overall efficiency often suffers under a minimax solution, i.e., the sum of all agents" utilities are often lower than under other solutions, it can be shown that the minimax solution is less  vulnerable to manipulation.
59-60].5 As the above mechanism does not work at the boundary points of Oc , we will introduce a procedure that works everywhere in an alternative space Oc .
4.2.1 Determining a fair initial tentative agreement It should be emphasised that the choice of the initial tentative agreement affects the fairness of the final agreement to be reached by the presented method.
Otherwise, without loss of generality, we assume that cv1 < cv2.
However, if x0 will then be chosen to be the final settlement and if x0 turns out to be the worst alternative to the other agent then this outcome is a very unfair one.
After carrying out the optimisation over the set of simple attributes, we are able to  assign the optimal values to the simple attributes from Simp.
NEGOTIATIONS As discussed by Lax and Sebenius [13], under incomplete  information the tension between creating and claiming values is the primary cause of inefficient outcomes.
Now, an outcome o ∈ O is just a point in the m-dimensional space of real numbers.
We will first review the method proposed by Ehtamo et al [4] to compute the compromise direction for a group of negotiators at a given point x ∈ Oc .
Then, an attribute ∈ Simp strongly dominates the rest of the attributes in Simp (for agent i) iff wi > P j∈(Simp− ) wi j .
The following results are proved in [9]: Let B(x) = 0 denote the equation of the boundary of Oc ,  defining x ∈ Oc iff B(x) ≥ 0.
Thus, the optimal values are the solution of the following optimisation problem: arg max v∈V alSimp Y i∈N ui(v) • The egalitarian solution (aka.
Due to the assumption made above, i.e.
That is, the utility of the agent with maximum utility is minimised.
(Note that this is possible  because the set V alj is bounded.)
We are now describing an iteration step to reach the next tentative agreement xh+1 from the current tentative agreement xh ∈ Oc .
The problem with these solutions, as discussed earlier, is that they are vulnerable to strategic behaviours when one of the attributes strongly dominates the rest of attributes.
The mediator then asks the agents to submit their valuations over the set of values {cv1, cv2, mv1, .
The parties are in global nonstrict opposition if they are not in global strict opposition.
Due to  Assumption 1, we can characterise agent i"s utility component over the set of attributes Simp by the following equation: ui,1([vSimp]) = X j∈Simp wi j ∗ ui,j([vj]) (1) where P j∈Simp wj = 1.
We have been temporarily making the assumption that the  outcome space O is the subset of Rm .
Let x ∈ Oc and let θ(x) denote the angle between the gradients ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x) at x.
We now state another assumption to be used in this section: ASSUMPTION 2.
the maximin solution): The utility of the agent with minimum utility is maximised.
(ii) How to find the more efficient agreement xh+1, given the current tentative agreement xh?
If cv1 = cv2 then cv1 is selected as the initial value for the attribute j as part of the initial tentative agreement.
By way of illustration, consider the set Simp containing only one attribute that could take values from the finite set {A, B, C, D}.
However, agents do have an incentive to understate their utility if the final settlement will be based on the above solutions alone.
[10] explore several implications of complex contracts in which attributes are possibly inter-dependent.
4.2 Optimisation on continuous attributes When the attributes take values from infinite sets, we assume that they are continuous.
Otherwise, between the two values pv1,j and av1,j, we eliminate the one that is closer to wv2,j, the  remaining value is denoted by cv1.
The above procedure guarantees that the agents do not gain by behaving strategically.
The mediator selects randomly p values mv1, .
Note that the tangent hyperplane to a curve is a useful approximation of the curve in the immediate vicinity of the point of tangency, x.
On the other hand, Nash [16] proves that the Nash solution satisfies the above four axioms for the cooperative bargaining games and is  considered a fair solution.
Given an initial tentative agreement x0, the method described above allows a sequence of tentative agreements x1, x2, .
Global strict and nonstrict oppositions are complementary cases.
It should be emphasised that we do not assume that agents  explicitly know their utility functions.
The bisecting compromise is defined by a function T BS : Oc 0 → R2 , T BS (x) = ∇u1(x) ∇u1(x) + ∇u2(x) ∇u2(x) , x ∈ Oc 0.
xh+λ1ζ+λ2ξ ∈ Oc , and ui(xh+λ1ζ+λ2ξ) = ui(xh), where L is a suitable interval of positive real numbers; e.g., L = {λ|λ > 0}, or L = {λ|a < λ ≤ b}, 0 ≤ a < b.
We"ll refer to Oc as the feasible set and assume that Oc is closed and convex.
to be iteratively generated.
For the method to be described in the following to work, we only assume that the agents know the relevant information, e.g.
Weak and strong oppositions indicate different levels of opposition.
A vector v whose tail is xh is said to be bounded in Oc if ∃λ > 0 such that xh +λv ∈ Oc .
However, to get around this problem (given that the Pareto-optimal set can be tractably  computed), we can apply this solution over the Pareto-optimal set only.
Ehtamo et al [3] present several methods to choose the initial  tentative agreement (called reference point in their paper).
We will continue our exposition by lifting this restriction and allowing discrete  attributes.
Attribute is said to be strongly dominant (for agent i) wrt.
The planes hT1(x) and hT2(x) intersect h∇(x) in the lines IS1(x) and IS2(x), respectively.
That is, distributive negotiation will then be required to settle the issue.
Of the three solutions presented above, the utilitarian solution does not support fairness.
That is, θ(x) = arccos( ∇u1(x).∇u2(x) ∇u1(x) .
Firsts, we state an easy lemma.
This  intersection is approximated by T G(xh).
It"s obvious that the minimax  solution produces inefficient outcomes.
Assume also that negotiator 2 assigns utilities of 1, 0.9, 0.7, and 0.4 to A, B, C, and D,  respectively.
Denote this vector by T G(xh).
The following exposition will be mainly reproduced from [9].
Let Simp ⊆ Att denote the set of all  simple attributes from Att.
Assume that negotiator 1 assigns utilities of 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, and 1 to A, B, C, and D, respectively.
However, there is yet another solution that aims to guarantee  fairness, the minimax solution.
We can now informally explain our solution to the problem of searching for joint gains.
, mvp from the open interval (cv1, cv2), where p ≥ 1.
The egalitarian solution is another  mechanism to achieve fairness by essentially helping the worst off.
Let Oc denote the set Q l∈Simp V all.
The iteration stops whenever a weakly Pareto optimal agreement is reached.
The following definition is reproduced from [9]: DEFINITION 2.
So far, we have been concentrating on the efficiency issue while leaving the fairness issue aside.

In many real-world  negotiations, this assumption would be too restrictive.
