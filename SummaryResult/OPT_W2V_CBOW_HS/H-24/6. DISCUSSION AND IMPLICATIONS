However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.
In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].
The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a user"s expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.
However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 
However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.
The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.
Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.
There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.
Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.
One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].
Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.
Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].
This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e.
It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.
Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc.
Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.
it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.
Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.
However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.
Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].
in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.
