Measure Meaning First Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail Last Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail Average Average judgment across all pages in the trail Maximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail These measures are used during our analysis to estimate the relevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and allow us to estimate search success in different ways.
The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of  postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users" search sessions, the average duration of users" search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users" search trails, the number of branches in users" navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users" search trails.
Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users" interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail.
Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).
Feature Meaning Session Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds) Trail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds) Display Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on the trail (in seconds) Num.
Steps (NS) Average number of steps from the page following the results page to the end of the trail Num.
The median number of search trails per user was 30.
A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.
We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.
The median number of steps in the trails was 3.
All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.
We chose multiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in many ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single  highlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail).
In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.
We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.
search to result click interval These seven features give us a useful overview of users" direct interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking for relevant information beyond the result page or how successful they are in locating relevant information.
Post-query browsing features (per trail).
number of queries per second between initial query and end-of-session Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are repeats Query Word Length (QWL) Avg.
A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browser"s back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.
More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].
Query and result-click features (per user).
Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.
All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.
To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.
Relevance judgment measures (per trail).
We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.
The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2.
rank of clicked results Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries Avg.
The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.
number of words in query Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg.
Feature Meaning Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg.
In Table 3 we list these measures.
Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users" post-query browsing behavior.
The features described in this section allowed us to analyze important attributes of the search process that must be better understood if we are to support users in their searching.
Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg.
2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.
number of queries per day Avg.
In the next section we present the findings of the analysis. 
Click Position (ACP) Avg.
Branches (NB) Average number of branches Num.
