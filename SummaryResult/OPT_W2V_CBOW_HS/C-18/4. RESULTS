In this set of  experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of  magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm.
We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3.
The data presented reflects the behaviors of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and  two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies  (random scanning and local bias).
In the local bias mode, early in the life of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered.
The class of worms presented are as follows: • I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no  learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); • S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and • S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and  existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.
Learning, Communication & Distributed Control • I-NL-NS: Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/ memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); • I-L-OOS: Generic worm, independent (I), learning/ memoryless (L), and one time sharing of information with offsprings only (OOS); • S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; • S-L-S&AOP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of addresses with neighbors and offsprings, shares passwords one time only (at creation) with offsprings(SA&OP); • S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and  existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.
For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of  susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings 328 at creation time) is more effective than sharing  passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm.
In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented.
In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords.
These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.
The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms.
Basically, the shared password list across subnets has been exhausted, and the swarm reverts to simply a random discovery of password  algorithm.
Note that it is trivial for a swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password space.
The percentage of local bias is varied across multiple runs.
In this case, we can think of the swarm as launching a  distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use different passwords to try to break into susceptible  uninfected host.
In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm  Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are presented.
In this set of simulation runs, a network  topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
The amount of local bias was varied across multiple simulation runs.
Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart.
As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient and dangerous than generic worms.
Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network  topologies subnets.
Basically, as soon as a  password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds.
In general the following class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated.
As it is shown in Figure 4, the results are consistent with our set of empirical results.
Then the targeting of local addresses assists in  discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and 4.
Address Scanning: • Random:= addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space; and • Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space.
Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time in non-local bias mode.
Short address handoffs are more effective than long ones.

The results  presented are aggregate behaviors.
In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.
In addition, the following  observations can be made.
Local preference is incredibly effective.
