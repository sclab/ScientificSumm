We first note that the function (s) is continuous in a finite game.
By the Corollary, for any game with a finite set of pure strategies and for any > 0, all Nash equilibria lie in the set of empirical -Nash equilibria if enough samples have been taken.
Now, let Nn denote all Nash equilibria of the game Γn and let Nδ = [ x∈N BS(x, δ), that is, the union of open balls of radius δ with centers at Nash equilibria of Γ.
We will now show that in the special case when Θ and A are finite and each Γθ has a unique Nash equilibrium, the estimates ˆθ of optimal designer parameter converge to an actual optimizer almost surely.
Then n(s) → (s) a.s. uniformly on S. Recall that N is a set of all Nash equilibria of Γ.
Then, since for any fixed > 0, N(θ) ⊂ Nn, (θ) when n is large enough, sup{φ∗ (θ)} = sup s∈N (θ) φ(s) ≤ sup s∈Nn, (θ) φ(s) = sup{ˆφ∗ (θ)} ≤ α for any such n. Thus, since we defined the welfare function of the designer to be I{sup{φ∗ (θ)} ≤ α} in our domain of interest, the empirical choice of θ satisfies the designer"s objective, thereby maximizing his welfare function.
Then, α < inf{ˆφ∗ (θ)} = inf s∈Nn, (θ) φ(s) ≤ inf s∈N (θ) φ(s) ≤ ≤ sup s∈N (θ) φ(s) = sup{φ∗ (θ)}, for every θ, and we can conclude that no setting of θ will satisfy the designer"s objective.
Let ˆθ = arg maxθ∈Θ W (Nn(θ), θ), where n is the number of times each pure profile was sampled in Γθ for every θ, and let θ∗ = arg maxθ∈Θ W (N(θ), θ).
First, let (Z, d) be a metric space, and X, Y ⊂ Z and define directed Hausdorff distance from X to Y to be h(X, Y ) = sup x∈X inf y∈Y d(x, y).
We can then prove the following general result.
If we define Nn,γ = {s ∈ S : n(s) ≤ γ}, we have the following corollary to Theorem 3: COROLLARY 4.
Now, we will show that when the number of samples is large enough, every Nash equilibrium of Γn is close to some Nash  equilibrium of the underlying game.
First, suppose we conclude that for a particular setting of θ, sup{ˆφ∗ (θ)} ≤ α.
As we now show, this provides some justification for our use of a set of profiles with a non-zero -bound as an estimate of the set of Nash equilibria.
Then ˆθ is a consistent estimator of θ∗ if W (N(θ), θ) is defined as a supremum, infimum, or  expectation over the set of Nash equilibria.
In this section, we show that n(s) → (s) a.s. uniformly on the mixed strategy space for any finite game, and, furthermore, that all mixed strategy Nash equilibria in empirical games eventually become arbitrarily close to some Nash equilibrium strategies in the underlying game.
As a matter of convenience, we will use notation un,i(a) to  refer to a payoff function of player i based on an average over n i.i.d.
Similarly, we define n(r) to be (r) with respect to the game Γn.
Alternatively, suppose we conclude that inf{ˆφ∗ (θ)} > α for  every θ in the domain.
Let S be a mixed strategy set defined on a finite game.
We use these results to show that under certain conditions, the optimal choice of the design parameter based on empirical data converges almost surely to the actual optimum.
We also assume that un,i(a) are independent for all a ∈ A and i ∈ I.
Suppose |N(θ)| = 1 for all θ ∈ Θ and suppose that Θ and A are finite.
We will use the notation Γn to refer to the game [I, R, {ui,n(·)}], whereas Γ will denote the underlying game, [I, R, {ui(·)}].
Note that h(Nδ, N) = δ.
The shortcoming of the above result is that, within our  framework, the designer has no way of knowing or ensuring that Γθ do, indeed, have unique equilibria.
Since (s) = 0 for every s ∈ N, we can find M large enough such that Pr{supn≥M sups∈N n(s) < γ} = 1.
At this point, we explore abstractly whether a design parameter choice based on payoff data can be asymptotically reliable.
Let W (s, θ) be continuous at the unique s∗ (θ) ∈ N(θ) for each θ ∈ Θ.
312 For the exposition that follows, we need a bit of additional  notation.
This result will lead us to consider convergence of optimizers based on empirical data to actual  optimal mechanism parameter settings.
Further, define BS(x, δ) to be an open ball in S ⊂ Z with center x ∈ S and radius δ.
samples from the distribution of payoffs.
For every γ > 0, there is M such that ∀n ≥ M, N ⊂ Nn,γ a.s.
16 Since we did not have all the possible deviations for any profile available in the data, the true upper bounds may be even lower.
In fact, ˆθ → θ∗ a.s. in each of these cases.
Observe that U ⊂ X ⇒ h(U, Y ) ≤ h(X, Y ).
Then almost surely h(Nn, N) converges to 0.
Then : S → R is continuous.
Suppose that |I| < ∞, |A| < ∞.
Suppose |I| < ∞ and |A| < ∞.
However, it does lend some  theoretical justification for pursuing design in this manner, and, perhaps, will serve as a guide for more general results in the future.
