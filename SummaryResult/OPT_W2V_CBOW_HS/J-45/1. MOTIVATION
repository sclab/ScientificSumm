Unlike most academic treatments of mechanism design, the  objective is a behavioral feature (moderate day-0 procurement) rather than an allocation feature like economic efficiency, and the allowed mechanisms are restricted to those judged to require only an  incremental modification of the current game.
Our analysis focuses on the setting of storage costs (taking other game modifications as fixed), since this is the most direct  deterrent to early procurement adopted.
In response to the problem, the TAC/SCM designers adopted several rule changes intended to penalize large day-0 orders.
We also confirm that the high day-0 procurement  observed in the 2004 tournament is a rational response to the setting of storage costs used.
Much of the  difficulty, of course, is anticipating the agents" (and their  developers") responses without essentially running a gaming exercise for this purpose.
Our methods incorporate estimation of sets of Nash equilibria and  sample Nash equilibria, used in conjuction to support general claims about the structure of the mechanism designer"s utility, as well as a restricted probabilistic analysis to assess the likelihood of  conclusions.
Although jockeying for day-0 procurement turned out to be an interesting strategic issue in itself [19], the phenomenon detracted from other interesting problems, such as adapting production levels to varying demand (since component costs were already sunk), and dynamic management of production, sales, and inventory.
Under the assumption that the simulator itself is the only reliable source of outcome  computation, we refer to our task as empirical mechanism design.
Several  participants noted that the predominance of day-0 procurement  overshadowed other key research issues, such as factory scheduling [2] and optimizing bids for customer orders [13].
Finally, we conclude from our data that it is very unlikely that any reasonable setting of storage costs would  result in acceptable levels of day-0 procurement, so a different design approach would have been required to eliminate this problem.
After the 2003  tournament, there was a general consensus in the TAC community that the rules should be changed to deter large day-0 procurement.
The task facing game organizers can be viewed as a problem in mechanism design.
As it happened, the specified negotiation behavior of suppliers provided a great incentive for agents to procure large quantities of components on day 0: the very beginning of the simulation.
Although the designs were widely discussed, predictions for the effects of various proposals were supported primarily by intuitive arguments or at best by back-of-the-envelope calculations.
The apparent difficulty in identifying rule modifications that  effect moderation in day-0 procurement is quite striking.
The designers have certain game features  under their control, and a set of objectives regarding game outcomes.
Standard game-theoretic and mechanism design methods are clearly relevant, although the lack of an analytic description of the game seems to be an impediment.
The episode caused us to consider whether new  ap306 proaches or tools could enable more systematic analysis of design options.
Our results confirm the basic intuition that incentives for day-0 purchasing decrease as storage costs rise.
In the sequel, we develop some general methods for empirical mechanism design and apply them to the TAC/SCM redesign  problem.
During the early rounds of the 2003 SCM competition, several agent  developers discovered this, and the apparent success led to most agents performing the majority of their purchasing on day 0.
Even this did not stem the tide, and day-0 procurement in the final rounds actually increased (by some  measures) from 2003 [9].
We believe that such operational  restrictions and idiosyncratic objectives are actually quite typical of practical mechanism design settings, where they are perhaps more commonly characterized as incentive engineering problems.
These included modifications to supplier pricing policies and introduction of storage costs assessed on inventories of components and finished goods.
Despite the changes, day-0 procurement was very high in the early rounds of the 2004 competition.
Overall, we contribute a formal framework and a set of methods for tackling indirect mechanism design problems in settings where only a black-box description of players" utilities is available.
We illustrate our problem with an anecdote from a supply chain research exercise: the 2003 and 2004 Trading Agent Competition (TAC) Supply Chain Management (SCM) game.
The agents procure components from the various suppliers and assemble finished goods for sale to customers, repeatedly over a simulated year.
We believe that most realistic problems are too complex to be amenable to exact analysis.
In a drastic measure, the GameMaster imposed a fivefold increase of storage costs midway through the tournament.
Consequently, we advocate the  approach of gathering evidence to provide indirect support of specific hypotheses. 
Replacing the  supplychain negotiation procedures with a one-shot direct mechanism, for example, was not an option.
TAC/SCM [1] defines a scenario where agents compete to maximize their profits as manufacturers in a supply chain.
