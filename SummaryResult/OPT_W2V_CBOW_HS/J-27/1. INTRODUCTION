This approach is useful when there is reason to make these stipulations, it gives an explicit utility function which can be used to make precise forecasts on demand for  unob36 served prices.
Given  observations of price and demand, under what circumstances can we conclude that the data is consistent with the  behavior of a utility maximizing agent equipped with a monotone concave utility function and subject to a budget constraint?
If such parameters exist, we conclude that the stipulated utility form is consistent with the  observations.
Furthermore, as we elaborate in section 2, basic observations on market demand behavior suggest that utility functions are monotone and concave.
In these cases,  assuming the probability distribution by which the observed price-demand pairs are generated is fixed, we are in a  position to offer a forecast and a probabilistic estimate on its accuracy.
Varian [20] introduces the generalized axiom of revealed preference (GARP), an equivalent form of Afriat"s consistency condition that is easier to verify  computationally.
We show, by computing the fat shattering dimension, that without any prior assumptions, the set of all demand functions induced by monotone concave utility functions is too rich to be efficiently PAC-learnable.
These papers introduce a model where an agent observes prices and Engel curves for these prices.
In section 5 we study the learnability of demand functions and directly compute the fat shattering dimension of the class of all demand functions and a class of income-Lipschitzian demand functions with a bounded global income-Lipschitz constant. 
Classical economic theory explains the incentives of the agents to engage in this behavior through the agents" preference over the set of available bundles  indicating that agents attempt to replace their current bundle with bundles that are both more preferred and attainable if such bundles exist.
The downside of this approach is that real life data is often inconsistent with convenient functional forms.
However, these methods do not consider the complexity of the demand functions and do not use any probabilistic model of the observations.
In this paper we examine the feasibility of demand  forecasting with a high degree of confidence using Afriat"s  conditions.
One of the common assumptions in this theory is that the preference relation is represented by a utility function and that agents strive to maximize their utility given a budget constraint.
However, under some prior assumptions on the set of demand functions we show that the fat shattering dimension is finite and therefore the corresponding sets are PAC-learnable.
He showes that rationalizability of a finite set of observations is equivalent to the strong axiom of  revealed preference.
We formulate the question in terms of whether the class of demand functions derived from monotone concave utilities is efficiently PAC-learnable.
Hence, an infinite amount of information is needed to refute the theory.
Therefore, they are unable to provide any estimate of the number of observations that would be sufficient for a good forecast or the degree of confidence in such a forecast.
Applying non parametric statistical methods, they reconstruct a trajectory from the observed demands of different segments and use it to obtain tighter bounds.
It is often the case that apart form the demand  observations there is additional information on the system and it is sensible to make parametric assumptions, namely, to stipulate some functional form of utility.
This gives an  improvement on Varian"s original bounds, though the basic idea is still to rule out demands that are revealed inferior.
We introduce the notion of fat shattering dimension and use it to devise a lower bound on the  sample complexity.
These properties do not require any parametric assumptions and are  technically refutable, but they do assume knowledge of the entire demand function and rely heavily on the differential  properties of demand functions.
Samuelson gave a necessary but insufficient condition on the underlying preference known as the weak axiom of revealed preference.
Afriat [1] proved his theorem by an explicit construction of a utility function witnessing consistency.
Moreover, if the observations are inconsistent it is unclear whether this is a refutation of the stipulated functional form or of utility maximization.
Both these methods would most likely give a good forecast for a fixed demand function after sufficiently many  observations assuming they were spread out in a reasonable manner.
In section 3 we present a new proof to Afriat"s theorem incorporating an algorithm for efficiently generating a forecasting function due to Teo and Vohra [17].
It is interesting to note that these necessary and  sufficient conditions for rationalizability are essentially versions of the well known Farkas lemma [6] (see also [22]).
The former requires full information for all prices, the latter for a finite number of prices.
He askes when can it be determined that a finite set of observations is  consistent with utility maximization without making  parametric assumptions?
Different segments of the population face the same prices with different budgets, and as much as  aggregate data can testify on individual preferences, show how demand varies with the budget.
Uzawa [16] and Mas-Colell [10, 11] introduced a notion of income-Lipschitz and showed that demand  functions with this property are rationalizable.
Richter [15] showes that strong axiom of revealed preference is equivalent to rationalizability by a strictly concave monotone utility function.
requires full information only on a finite number of price  trajectories.
This pattern of behavior is the essence of supply and demand, general equilibria and other aspects of  consumer theory.
Consistency with utility maximization would then depend on fixing the  parameters of the utility function to be consistent with the observations and with a set of equations called the  Slutski equations.
Varian"s forecasting algorithm basically rules out bundles that are revealed inferior to observed bundles and finds a bundle from the remaining set that together with the observations is consistent with GARP.
The motivation for this crossover is to utilize income segmentation in the population to restructure econometric information.
We show that this algorithm is  computationally efficient and can be used as a learning algorithm.
Addressing these issues Houthakker [7] noted that an  observer can see only finite quantities of data.
In section 4 we give a brief introduction to PAC learning including several modifications to learning real vector  valued functions.
Afriat [1] gives another set of rationalizability conditions the observations must satisfy.
Furthermore, he  introduces Samuelson"s money metric as a canonical utility function and gives upper and lower envelope utility functions for the money metric.
This model is in a sense a hybrid between Mas-Colell and Afriat"s aproaches.
In section 2 we briefly discuss the basic assumptions of  demand theory and their implications.
The preference relation is therefore the key factor in understanding consumer behavior.
Knoblauch [9] shows these envelopes can be computed efficiently.
This brings us to the question, first raised by  Samuelson [18], to what degree is this theory refutable?
Our first result is  negative.
We also sketch results on upper bounds.
Varian [20] took this one step further progressing from consistency to  forecasting.
On the other hand the approach taken by Blundell et al.
A different approach is presented by Blundell et al.
A market is an institution by which economic agents meet and make transactions.
Varian [21] provides an up to date survey on this line of research.
