, pn is shattered it suffices to find for every b a demand function fb supported by concave utility such that fb(pi) = yb i .
, yid be points on the facets of Λi that intersect yi, such that ||pjr||1 · ||yi − yis||∞ = o(1) for all j, s and r. We call the set of points yi, yi1, .
Let C be a set of L-income-Lipschitz  demand functions from ∆d to Rd + for some global constant L ∈ R. Then fatC(γ) ≤ ( L γ )d Proof : Let p1, .
, n be a set of price vectors inducing parallel budget sets Bi and let x1, .
, yn) be a set of demands such that yi = xi if bi = 0 and yi = xi if bi = 1 (we omit an additional index b in y for notational convenience).
The points of any one level lie on the facets of a polytope Λi and the prices pis are supporting hyperplanes of the polytope.
Thus, the polytope defines a utility function for which these demands are utility maximizing.
As we have seen in section 4 the number of observations required to PAC learn the demand depends on the fat shattering dimension of the class of demand functions which in turn depends on the class of utility functions they are derived from.
= o(1) This shows that pir · (yjs − yir) = pi · (ys − yi) + o(1) = 2j−i − 1 + o(1) therefore pir · (yjs − yir) ≤ 0 iff j < i or i = j.
, (ynd, pnd) is  consistent with monotone concave utility function maximization and again by Afriat"s theorem there exists u supporting a demand function fb ✷ The proof above relies on the fact that an agent have high utility and marginal utility for very large bundles.

Let C be a set of demand functions from Rd + to Rd + then fatC(γ) = ∞ Proof 1: For ε > 0 let pi = 2−i p for i = 1, .
It follows that there are no negative cycles for the union of observations from all levels hence the sequence of  observations (y1, p1), (y11, p11), (y12, p12), .
We show that the class of utility functions that have marginal utilities with compact support and for which the relevant  demand functions are income-Lipschitzian has finite fat  shattering dimension.
This shows that pi · (yj − yi) ≤ 0 iff j < i hence there can be no negative cycles and the condition is met.
Let H0 and H1 be hyperplanes that are not parallel to p and let xi ∈ Bi ∩ (xi + H+ 0 ) and xi ∈ Bi ∩ (xi + H− 1 ) for i = 1 .
, yid the level i demand and pi, pi1, .
Applying H¨olders inequality we get |pir · yjs − pi · yj | ≤ |(pir − pi) · yj| + |pir · (yjs − yj)| ||pir − pi||∞ · ||yj ||1 + ||yjs − yj||∞ · ||pir||1.
To avoid this problem we reprove the theorem by constructing utility functions u such that u(xi) = u(xi ) for all i and therefore a distinct utility function is associated with each labeling.
, pid be price vectors satisfying the following conditions: 1. the budget sets Bs i are supporting hyperplanes of a convex polytope Λi 2. yi is a vertex of Λi 3.
The first is the class of all demand functions, we show that this class has infinite shattering dimension (we give two proofs) and is therefore not PAC learnable.
Therefore the shattering of the prices p1, .
The other direction of Afriat"s theorem  therefore implies there can be no negative cycles within points on the same level.
, bn) ∈ {0, 1}n such that bi = 0 and bj = 1, ||fb(pi) − fb(pj)||∞ > γ hence ||pi − pj||∞ > γ L .
✷ Proof 2: The utility functions satisfying Afriat"s condition in the first proof could be trivial assigning the same utility to xi as to xi .
We show that the class has a finite fat shattering dimension that depends on the support and the income-Lipschitz constant.
, pn ∈ ∆d be a shattered set with  witnesses x1, .
This implies that if there is a negative cycle then all the points in the cycle must belong to the same level.
Since yi are in the budget 40 set yi · 2−i p = 1, therefore pi · (yj − yi) = 2j−i − 1.
The second class we  consider is the class of demand functions derived from utilities with bounded support and income-Lipschitz.
In fact, pick a utility function whose level sets are parallel to the budget constraint.
To show that such a function exists it suffices to show that Afriat"s conditions are satisfied.
To show that p1, .
xi+H+ 0 ∩xj +H− 0 = ∅  implying xi + H− 1 ∩ xj + H+ 1 = ∅, for a labeling b = (b1, .
We notice however, that in this case we obtain a utility function that yield demand functions that are very sensitive to small price changes.
n let pi1, .
We compute the fat shattering dimension for two classes of demands.
For any labeling b = (b1, .
Unfortunately,  rescaling the previous example shows that even a compact set may contain a large shattered set.
For i = 1, .
PREFERENCE Algorithm 1 is an efficient learning algorithm in the sense that it finds a hypothesis with sample error zero in time polynomial in the number of observations.

In many cases it is reasonable to assume that the marginal for very large bundles is very small, or even that the utility or the marginal utility have compact support.
