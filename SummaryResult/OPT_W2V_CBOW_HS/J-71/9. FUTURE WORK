However, the true test of the  mechanism"s ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.
Formally, what are the  incentives for traders to act on new information and when?
The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system.
I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that  always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple  percentage values that must sum to 100).
This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.
The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers.
I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or  combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.
However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development.
I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.
Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.
How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader  incentives?
In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism?
This  paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.
DPM may also have some computational  advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.
• DPM call market.
• Incentive analysis.
• Compound/combinatorial betting.
• Laboratory experiments and field tests.
• Real-valued variables.
