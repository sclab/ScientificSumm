Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.
Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.
The spread between the highest bid price and the  lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.
Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal  payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.
Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense  infinite liquidity for buying.
Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their  chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the market"s close.
Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always  willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.
The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a  bidask spread.
172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.
In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the  market"s close.
If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the  market"s close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.
It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in  al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.
, Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.
If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).
Examples include stock  markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13],  futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].
2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.
One difference  between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors  cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.
Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.
After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.
So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.
An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.
As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity  occurs.
Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.
A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26].
Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against  undesirable outcomes.
There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).
In a pari-mutuel  market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.
We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.
In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.
However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.
But running multiple consecutive  markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.
This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.
People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).
A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.
Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money.
In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.
At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options  markets, for example.
This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.
An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is  refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.
Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.
In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only  redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.
The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.
As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.
Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel  market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at  consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing  information dynamics.
3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com.
Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.
That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.
While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.
The market maker may be a  person, or may be an automated algorithm.
In this case, the  market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the  relative level of betting on the various outcomes.
The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).
The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain  asset at some instant in time.
People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.
However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.
In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a  scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.
Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to  bettor demand.
Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the  market maker to risk.
The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 
So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final  payout rates.
The patron"s payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of  subsidizing the n event marginals independently.
2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.
Now suppose that A  occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).
Moreover, there are no guarantees about the  payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.
An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in  general injects a variable amount of money into the system.
In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].
Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.
The patron"s final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.
The term securities market in economics and finance  generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.
4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds.
In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.
If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.
Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.
In the limit of many traders, it produces a  combined estimate.
More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and  exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, .
A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.
2.4 Market scoring rule Hanson"s [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new  mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some  properties in common with a DPM.
While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.
2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of  uncertain future propositions is also common.
Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.
Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for  allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.
In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate  information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].
Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information  aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].
Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.
An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.
Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23].
Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.
Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.
An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.
The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive,  meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.
