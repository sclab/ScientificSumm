I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 
To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.
The mechanism  combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a  parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.
Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.
The  interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.
Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.
I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).
An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.
I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.
