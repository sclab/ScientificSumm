For the proposed solution, we assume that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the minimum exposure ed is not reached.
To evaluate the  probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor deployment, we make the following approximation: the  distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the  exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
If the desired exposure is obtained after the first step, the cost of deployment is Cd + n1Cs, and this 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Number of sensors Probability ed =95% ed =90% ed =85% ed =80% Figure 5: Probability that the minimum  exposure is above ed for varying number of sensors and ed=80%,85%,90% and 95%.

As the minimum exposure e is a random variable, the cost of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure is reached is also a random variable C. We now derive the expression for the expected value of C. Let ni be the total number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum number of steps S so that nS = M. Note that ni − ni−1 is the number of sensors deployed at step i.
If M is the maximum number of sensors available, the confidence of obtaining a least exposure of ed or more is 1−FM (ed).
Let ed be the desired minimum exposure for the sensor network to be deployed when a maximum of M sensors are available for deployment.
Considering all the possible events, the expected cost is given by E{C} = S−1 i=1 (i.Cd + ni.Cs) i−1 j=1 Fnj (ed) (1 − Fni (ed)) + (S.Cd + M.Cs) S−1 j=1 Fnj (ed) (4) Note that a different expression is needed for the cost of step S since no additional sensors are deployed after this step even when the desired exposure is not obtained. 
As mentioned in the previous section, there is no a priori guarantee that the exposure ed will be obtained when  deploying the sensors.
Also let Cd be the cost of deploying the sensors at each step and Cs be the cost of each sensor.
This is an approximation since the exposure obtained with n sensors is always higher than the exposure obtained with only k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
ber of sensors n, the least exposure e is a random variable.
Indeed, a given minimum exposure can correspond to many different deployment positions, some of which can be easily improved by deploying a few additional sensors (e.g.
The approximation is also justified by the loose relation between exposure and sensors positions.
Let Fn(x) denote the cumulative distribution function of e, that is the probability that e is less than x, when n sensors are deployed.
when there is a empty space in the region coverage), some of which can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors (e.g.
We observed that the re-deployment of just a few sensors can  substantially modify the coverage of the region, for example when filling empty spaces.
when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region).
event happens with probability 1 − Fn1 (ed).
In this section, we derive an analytical model for the cost of deployment.
