The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target  detection in a region of interest.
This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor networks performing target detection over a region of  interest.
In section 3, the problem of random  deployment is formulated and several solutions are presented.
An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4 and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in section 6 to determine the optimum solution for a given  environment.
The deployment can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be  airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means,  generally resulting in a random placement.
The deployment of sensor networks varies with the application considered.
In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random which corresponds to many practical applications where the region to be monitored is not accessible for precise  placement of sensors.
Since the local observations made by the sensors depend on their position, the performance of the detection algorithm is a function of the deployment.
One possible measure of the goodness of deployment for target detection is called path exposure.
In order to detect a target moving through the region, sensors have to make local observations of the environment and collaborate to produce a global decision that reflects the status of the region covered [2].
Examples of such systems are in surveillance, monitoring of pollution, traffic, agriculture or civil infrastructures [6].
The tradeoffs lie between the network performance, the cost of the sensors deployed, and the cost of deploying the sensors.
This paper is organized as follows.
It is a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing the region using a given path.
Recent advances in computing hardware and software are responsible for the emergence of sensor networks capable of observing the environment, processing the data and making decisions based on the observations.
In section 2, a definition for path exposure is proposed and a method to evaluate the exposure of a given path is developed.
Such a network can be used to monitor the environment, detect, classify and  locate specific events, and track targets over a specific region.
The set of paths to be considered may be constrained by the environment.
This collaboration requires local processing of the observations, communication between different nodes, and information fusion [7].
It can be predetermined when the environment is sufficiently known and under control, in which case the sensors can be strategically hand placed.
The higher the path  exposure, the better the deployment.
The paper concludes with section 7. 
For  example, if the target is expected to be following a road, only the paths consisting of the roads need to be considered.
