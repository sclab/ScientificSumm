A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of ‘relational" barriers arising from  personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.
2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be  induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation,  particularly when a ‘passion for the subject" is present [4].
choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this  conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.
Simulation-based investigations of  wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the  effectiveness of others" referrals or by varying the degree of  inertia in individual behaviour.
The  simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work  presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects.
While the formalisation of the idea that  satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g.
[5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in  intention to stay with a product than that explained by  satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more  influential than either transactional or learning barriers.
Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.
There is generally little empirical evidence on the  relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the  retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.
in financial services), ‘learning" barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and ‘contractual" barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].
2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.
The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to  conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient  outcomes (e.g.
A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes  ‘transactional" barriers associated with the monetary cost of  changing (e.g.
Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and  similarity of views and experiences [3].
These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest  referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.
The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.
Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought.
