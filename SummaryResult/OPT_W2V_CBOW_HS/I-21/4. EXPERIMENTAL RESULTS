Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a  satisfying brand.
Also interesting is the finding that  equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network  connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the  market leading product.
κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a  network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.
Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger  market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive  word-ofmouth communication and increase negative  communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product  relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.
In the ‘easy" choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups.
There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.
Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of  different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the  equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour.
Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially  independent of network structure for the easy task, with  average share converging quickly to around 35%.

In fact, the role may even be more  important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme  barriers (β = 0.4).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative market share  captured by the top three products in the market over time, for all types of market barriers using different degree  distributions.
For  simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e.
In the ‘hard" choice condition, there are 500  products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.
The reduction in the  number of positive referrals as market barriers impose  increasingly severe constraints is also reflected in Table 4, which shows the median number of product trials each agent makes per time period based on a referral from another agent.
This clearly has a relatively greater impact on the highly-connected network, which  relies on the spread of positive referral information to achieve higher satisfaction levels.
Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60%  regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.
The first few connections one makes increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60% from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a further increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four.
Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the ‘hard" condition.
This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more  highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of one"s contacts is using it.
Firstly, in the absence of market barriers, a greater proportion of the  market is captured by the market leading products when  markets are highly-connected relative to when they are  poorlyconnected.
Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an  approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the  smallworld network, with the random and tight community  networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.
However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network  becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.
in little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.
This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g.
It seems reasonable to suggest that increases in negative word-of-mouth, which occurs when an unsatisfied agent is prevented from switching to another product, are particularly damaging to leading products when agents are well-connected, and that under moderate to strong market barriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by the spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network.
4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the  population are satisfied.
In these two tables,  equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of all time periods).
In contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative satisfaction levels by less than 4%.
Whereas under few or no barriers agents in a highly-connected network make substantially more reference-based product trials than agents in poorly-connected networks, when  barriers are severe both types of network carry only very little positive referral information.
4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.
Secondly, the  relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers.
Secondly, word-of-mouth communication continues to play an important role in  improving the performance of the system even when market barriers are high.
Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world  network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.
Moreover, this result might be even stronger in reality if agents in poorly-connected  networks attempt to compensate for the relative sparcity of connections by making more forceful or persuasive referrals where they do occur.
The effect of task  difficulty is evaluated on three network structures  corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world  network), and r = 0 (tight ‘communities" of agents), with  results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3.
Firstly, there is a strong diminishing marginal return of additional connections  beyond a small number.
Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the ‘hard" condition.

Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results.
Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous  subjective opinion functions Sij.
In moving from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leaders collectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under the larger degree distributions κ = 9 and κ = 3 respectively.
Clearly, there are enough agents independently solving the task i.e.
Again, two comments can be made.
