When sharing information, teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) ignore load predictions; teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2)  consider load predictions; teams of type 3 (TA3, TH3) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the receivers of a multi-party message (MInform) by their loads and split the message into  multiple messages with their receivers having the same load.
To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.
The performance of teams who did not share any information (the ‘NoSharing" curve in Fig.
Thus, depending on the current HAP load, an agent may randomly ignore part or all of the  incoming information (having no effect on the establishment of shared mental models).
In order to measure the actual shared mental models, a special SMMall agent named ‘OmniAll" was added to each team to monitor inter-agent communications and record the actual effects of  information sharing on each agent"s mental model.
5.2 Experiment Design To investigate the impacts of the HMM-based load models on the evolution of shared mental models (SMM), we  conducted experiments for both Agent teams and HAP teams, where agent teams involve agent processing load models only, HAP teams involve models of HAP processing load (i.e., the co-effect of agent processing load and human  cognitive load).
On the other hand, each time step at most nout number of information-sharing commands can be effective; more than that contribute nothing to the  establishment of shared mental models.
4 the same findings can be derived for the performance of agent teams.
4, we have: (1) For each team type, the performance (percentage of SMM overtime) averaged over 10 teams  increased as communication capacity increased  (TH1-6<TH18<TH1-10, TH2-6<TH2-8<TH2-10).
5(a), agent A only needs to perform MInform once (with B and C being receivers) to achieve the common knowledge of the shared belief about I (It  consumes 2 of A"s communication resources, one for each  receiver).
This means that at each time step a human  subject has to carefully go through three cognitive decisions: whether the information under consideration needs to be shared (i.e., whether it is associated with an info-cell just flashed), whether a team member is the right party to share the information with (i.e., whether it really needs the  information), and whether this is the right time to share (i.e., whether the team member is currently overloaded).
Thus, HAP teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of other types.
Secondary task performance at step t is thus  measured as the number of cells marked (remembered) correctly at t, which is taken as the observable state of the  HMMbased cognitive load model of that human subject.
According to the semantics of MInform (multi-party inform), when A MInforms I to others, assuming all the receivers and  overhearers will accept I, A will update its internal model of their beliefs; each of the receivers (overhearers), upon  getting the message, will update its own beliefs as well as its model of the sender"s and all the other receivers" beliefs.
To share the information associated with an info-cell, a human subject needs to click the right mouse button on the cell, and select the receiving teammate(s) from the popup menu.
Instantaneous info-sharing utility is defined as c∈S s value(c)/|S|, where s value(c) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 0 receiver(c) ∈ T4 0 c is known to receiver(c) 1/|Mi| receiver(c) ∈ Ti, i = 4 (6) In sum, this study involved 18 types of teams, each team had 4 members, and each team type was tested by 10 domain scenarios.
At each time step, let T = T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 be a sequence of sets, where T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4 are sets of teammates whose current load states are negligibly, slightly, fairly, heavily, and overly  respectively.

This indicates that the information sharing performance of a HAP team can be significantly  affected by both the human subject"s own cognitive load, and the awareness of other team members" load.
(2) The averaged  performance of TH2 teams performed consistently better than the TH1 teams for each capacity setting (TH2-6>TH1-6, TH2-8>TH1-8, TH2-10>TH1-10), and the performance  difference of TH1 and TH2 teams increased as communication capacity increased.
In addition, the results also show that the SMMs of each team type were maintained steadily at a certain level after about 20 time steps.
The primary task of a human subject is to build a shared mental model of the dynamic situation by sharing the right  information with the right party at the right time.
First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig.
For teams composed of SMMall agents only, the agents will take all the roles played by an agent or a human partner in HAP teams.
As an indirect judgment, we plotted the  regression fitted lines for the means of information sharing utility of HAP teams with and without load displays.
Thus, agent teams of type 3 achieved better subgroup SMMs, and their team members had much higher coherent view of group SMMs than teams of type 1 (although slightly worse than team type 2).
Due to constraints on communication capacity and  processing capacity, an agent can be inaccurate when tracking other teammates" mental models.
Because the info-sharing utility measure and the cognitive load measure are indicators of primary task performance and secondary task performance, respectively, their linear relationship complies with  cognitive studies that secondary task performance can be used The Sixth Intl.
The secondary task of a human subject is to remember and mark the cells being flashed (not necessarily in the exact order) by left mouse clicks.
4, for HAP teams, the performance of team type 2 for each fixed communication capacity was consistently better than team type 3 (TH3-6≤TH2-6, TH3-8<TH2-8,  TH3-10<TH210); the difference became more significant as  communication capacity increased.
An agent, with a pre-trained HMM-based cognitive load model for its human partner and a processing load model for each of the other HAPs in the team, also estimates and displays their instantaneous loads.
These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig.
In SMMall, in order to enable team-level inference, each agent maintains an internal model of every team member"s mental model (beliefs).
When a group of agents can be partitioned into subteams, splitting messages by their loads can be more effective for subteam SMMs.
5.4 Multi-Party Communication for SMM We now compare teams of type 2 and type 3 (which splits multi-party messages by receivers" loads).
Communications among HAPs is done by the corresponding  SMMall agents, which have both limited capacity nin for  processing incoming information and limited outgoing  communication capacity nout.
agent teams was even worse (for each fixed capacity) than the performance of type 1 agent teams.
Moreover, although agent A still consumes 2, the whole team needs more resources (3 in this case).
For agent teams, TH3>TH1>TH2 holds in Fig.
Due to their different (maybe overlapping)  observability, at each time step they may get different situational information.
This indicates that, other things being equal, the benefit of exploiting load estimation when sharing information becomes more significant when communication capacity is larger.
An agent A0 in a team of TA2 may send one multi-party message, while an agent A0 in a team of TA3 will send two messages (one to A2, one to A1 and A3).
5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others" efforts).
In this section we describe the experiments conducted to evaluate the load estimation models and the shared belief map concept for developing team shared mental models.
This can be explained by the difference of two-party and multi-party communications.
A time step starts with certain  infocells of the shared belief map being flashed quickly (for 2 s).
For HAP teams, TH3>TH2>TH1 holds in Fig.
5.1 Problem Description The members of a HAP team (i.e., a team composed of Human-Agent-Pairs) are situated in a dynamic  environment.
Sending information to an overloaded teammate will waste the capacity that  otherwise can be used to share information with a less loaded teammate.
For the HAP teams with load displays there is a strong negative linear relationship between info-sharing utility and cognitive load levels (Pearson correlation coefficient is − √ 0.899 = −0.948 with P-Value = 0.014).
5.5 The HMM-based Cognitive Model To validate the HMM-based cognitive load model is  extremely difficult because detecting the real, noise-resistant cognitive load of human beings is far beyond the current technology.
An agent governs group communication and processes  messages to update the shared belief map on its display.
In addition, we controlled agents" outgoing communication capacities by varying from 6, 8, to 10.
This realizes a way, as suggested by Klimoski [6], to measuring the degree of overlap in immediate, intermediate, and long-term situation awareness zones held by group members.
The goal of a HAP team is to selectively share information in a timely manner to develop global situation awareness (say, for making critical decisions).
Consider teams of type 1 (TA1, TH1) and teams of type 2 (TA2, TH2).
The human and agent of a HAP assume different roles.
However, to maintain a SMM steadily at a certain level is a non-trivial team task.
The above description applies to HAP teams.
Hence, generally, multi-party communication encourages the forming/evolving of team SMMs.
Let S be the set of information-sharing  commands issued by a human partner at the current step.
We also recorded instantaneous information sharing  utility, which is defined as follows.
However, for teams without load displays there is a strong quadratic rather than linear relationship (correlation coefficient is √ 0.974 = 0.987 with P-Value = 0.015).
Knowing of  others" load (by estimation) will reduce the quadratic relation to a linear relation.
Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party  performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.
However, splitting multi-party messages by receivers" loads does enhance subgroup SMMs.
However, to achieve the same effects using Inform (Fig.
The flashed cells are exactly those with newly available information that should be shared at that time step.
An info-cell is frozen at the end of a time step: the associated information is no longer sharable.
There are costs associated with information sharing.
This requires that the newly available information be shared in time, not later.
