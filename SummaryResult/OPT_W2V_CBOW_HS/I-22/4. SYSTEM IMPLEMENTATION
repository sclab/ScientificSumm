The concept of shared belief map helps maintain and present a human partner with a synergy view of the shared mental models evolving within a team.
SMMall has also implemented the HMM-based models (Section 3) to allow an agent to estimate its human  partner"s and other team members" cognitive/processing loads.
4.2 Shared Belief Map & Load Display A concept shared belief map has been proposed and  implemented into SMMall; this responds to the need to seek innovative perspectives or concepts that allow group  members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental models at different levels of abstraction.
A shared mental model can thus be measured in terms of the closeness of individuals" measure of the group"s MMOP to the objective measure.
This  notion can be used to measure the tightness of an emerging subgroup or guide the process of team coalition.
As described in  Section 5, humans and agents interacted through shared belief maps in the evaluation of HMM-based load models.
The human partner of a HAP can adjust her cognitive load at runtime, as well as monitor another HAP"s agent processing load and its probability of processing the information she sends at the current time step.
(4) The MMOP of a subgroup is always larger than the MMOP of the whole group.
SMMall supports a collection of multi-party  performatives such as MInform (multi-party inform), MAnnounce (multi-party announce), and MAsk (multi-party ask).
Formally, given a group of k agents G = {Ai|1 ≤ i ≤ k}, let Bi = {Iim|1 ≤ m ≤ n} be the beliefs (information) held by agent Ai, where each Iim is a set of information of the same type, and n (the size of information space) is fixed for the agents in G, then MMOP(G) = 100 n 1≤m≤n ( | ∩1≤i≤k Iim| | ∪1≤i≤k Iim| ).
Aside from the speaker, the  listeners involved in a conversation can be classified into  various roles such as addressees (the direct listeners), auditors (the intended listeners), overhearers (the unintended but  anticipated listeners), and eavesdroppers (the unanticipated listeners).
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) are three built-in channels: agentTalk channel (inter-agent activity-specific communication), control channel (meta  communication for team coordination), and world channel  (communication with the external world).
The perceptible color (hue) difference manifested from a shared belief map indicates the information difference among team members, and hence visually represents the potential information needs of each team member (See Figure 3).
3, below the shared belief map there is a load display for each team member.
Second, due to communication or information processing limits, each individual"s subjective measure of the group"s MMOP can be very different from the group"s MMOP  measured objectively from external.
MMOP of a group is defined as the intersection of all the individual mental states relative to the union of  individual mental states of the group.
We use mental model overlapping  percentage (MMOP) as the base to measure shared mental models.
Figure 3: Shared Mental Map Display In sum, shared belief maps allow the inference of who needs what, and load displays allow the judgment of when to share information.
4.1 Multi-Party Communication Multi-party communication refers to conversations  involving more than two parties.
SMMall agents, which can form Human-Agent-Pairs with human partners, support  multiparty communication with the following features.
It stresses human"s role in team activities by means of novel collaborative concepts and  multiple representations of context woven through all aspects of team work.
(5) Obviously, D⊥ measures the coherency of the whole group: the smaller the better.
(3) First, a shared mental model can be measured in terms of the distance of averaged subgroup MMOPs to the MMOP of the whole group.
Here we describe two components pertinent to the experiment reported in Section 5: multi-party  communication and shared mental maps (a complete description of the SMMall system is beyond the scope of this paper).
Each row captures the belief model of one team member, and each column  corresponds to a specific information type (all columns together define the boundary of the information space being  considered).
with the right party at the right time on the evolving of shared mental models.
Intuitively, the larger distance from the MMOP of a subgroup to that of the whole group, the more overlapping mental models the subgroup shares.
Let MMOP(G) and M MOPi(G) be the objective measure and agent Ai"s subjective measure of the group"s shared mental models, respectively.
High performing teams can often maintain their shared mental models such that the MMOP is stable at an acceptable level as activities proceed, while the MMOP  measure of the shared mental models of a low-performing teams can fluctuate or decrease notably over time. 
A shared belief map is a table with color-coded  info-cellscells associated with information.
A shared mental model can be measured in terms of the  stableness of the instantaneous measures of MMOP, D , or D⊥ The Sixth Intl.
It allows selective (selected subset) or holistic info-sharing.
The listeners of a multi-party performative can be addressees,  auditors, and overhearers, which correspond to ‘to", ‘cc", and ‘bcc" in e-mail terms, respectively.
4.3 Metrics for Shared Mental Models We here describe how we measure team performance in our experiment.
Multi-party communication is one of the  characteristics of human teams.
There are 2 curves in a display: the blue (dark) one plots human"s instantaneous cognitive loads and the red one plots the processing loads of a HAP as a whole.
If there are n team members, each agent needs to maintain 2n HMM-based models to support the load displays.
Hence, nearby info-cells can form meaningful plateaus (or contour lines) of similar colors.
Thus, info-cell Cij of a map encodes all the beliefs (instances) of information type j held by agent i.
Colored plateaus indicate those sections of a shared mental model that bear high overlapping degrees.
Together they allow us to investigate the impact of sharing the right info.
Thus, the more closely a HAP can estimate the actual processing loads of other HAPs, the better information sharing performance the HAP can achieve.
Briefly, SMMall has implemented the concept with the following features: 1.
Third, shared mental models evolve over time.
A context menu can be popped up for each info-cell to view and share the associated information instances.
As shown in Fig.
This is particularly useful if an agent wants to know the communication load imposed on a teammate.
It also  allows third-party info-sharing, say, A shares the information held by B with C. 3.
Color coding applies to each info-cell to indicate the number of information instances held by the corresponding agent.
SMMall (Shared Mental Models for all) is a cognitive agent architecture developed for supporting human-centric collaborative computing.

An agent can also partially tune to a channel to get statistic information about the messages communicated over the channel.
Mixed-initiative info-sharing: both agents and human partners can initiate a multi-party conversation.

Information types that are semantically related (e.g., by inference rules) can be closely organized.

on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 399 over time.
An agent can fully tune to a channel to collect messages sent (or cc, bcc) to it.
Without losing generality, we define paired SMM distance (subgroups of size 2) D2 as: D2 (G) = 1≤i<j≤k (MMOP({Ai, Aj}) − MMOP(G))2 .
SMMall supports channelled-communication.
We define SMM deviation D⊥ as: D⊥(G) = 1≤i≤k (MMOPi(G) − MMOP(G))2 .
