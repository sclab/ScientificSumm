The two interesting  questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many purchases will they influence?
First, we analyze the probability of  purchasing as one gets more and more recommendations.
As we move to higher numbers of incoming recommendations, the number of observations drops rapidly.
But if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a  function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and music have qualitatively similar trends.
On the other had one would also think that there is a saturation point - if a person hasn"t bought a product after a number of recommendations, they are not likely to change their minds after receiving even more of them.
For every recommendation r on some product p between nodes u and v, we first  determine how many recommendations were exchanged between u and v before recommendation r. Then we check whether v, the recipient of recommendation, purchased p after  recommendation r arrived.
3.1 Probability of buying versus number of incoming recommendations First, we examine how the probability of purchasing changes as one gets more and more recommendations.
For books we observe that the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant up to 3 exchanged recommendations.
Lastly, we  observe the recommendation network from the perspective of the sender of the recommendation.
The maximal number of received recommendations is 172 (and that person did not buy) 232 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 Incoming Recommendations ProbabilityofBuying 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 Incoming Recommendations ProbabilityofBuying (a) Books (b) DVD Figure 5: Probability of buying a book (DVD) given a number of incoming recommendations.
This means that many different individuals are recommending to the same person, and after that person makes a purchase, even though all of them made a ‘successful recommendation" 233 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 5 10 15 20 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit 5 10 15 20 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit (a) Books (b) DVD (c) Music (d) Video Figure 7: Top row: Number of resulting purchases given a number of outgoing recommendations.

A person who recommends only a few products will have her friends" attention, but one who floods her friends with all sorts of recommendations will start to loose her influence.
Figure 6 shows the probability of buying as a function of the total number of exchanged recommendations between two persons up to that point.
One would expect that recommendations would be the most effective when recommended to the right subset of friends.
We observe a peak in probability of buying at 2 incoming recommendations and then a slow drop.
Figure 5 shows the probability of purchasing a product as a function of the number of incoming recommendations on the product.
This experiment shows that recommendations start to lose effect after more than two or three are passed between two people.
The maximum was 30 incoming recommendations.
We measure the effectiveness of recommendations as a function of the total number of previously exchanged  recommendations between the two nodes.
3.2 Success of subsequent recommendations Next, we analyze how the effectiveness of  recommendations changes as two persons exchange more and more  recommendations.
We use all purchases.
The difference in the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10  recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an order of magnitude more than other product groups.
As the number of  exchanged recommendations increases, the probability of  buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and then levels off.
So far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the recommendation network.
Next, we measure recommendation effectiveness as two people  exchange more and more recommendations.
3.3 Success of outgoing recommendations In previous sections we examined the data from the  viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation.
Bottom row: Probability of getting a credit given a number of outgoing recommendations.
Does a node that makes more recommendations also influence more purchases?
The top row of figure 7 shows how the average number of purchases changes with the number of outgoing  recommendations.
Figure 5(a) shows that, overall, book recommendations are rarely followed.
Next, we ask questions about the effectiveness of recommendations in the  recommendation network itself.
For example, there were 5 million cases with 1 incoming recommendation on a book, and only 58 cases where a  person got 20 incoming recommendations on a particular book.
DVDs exhibit different behavior, with the expected number of purchases increasing throughout.
This means that after a person gets 10 recommendations on a particular DVD, they  become immune to them - their probability of buying does not increase anymore.
The number of observations is 2.5 million at 1 incoming recommendation and 100 at 60  incoming recommendations.
A large number of exchanged  recommendations can be a sign of trust and influence, but a sender of too many recommendations can be perceived as a spammer.
For DVDs (figure 5(b)) we observe a saturation around 10 incoming recommendations.
For books, music, and videos the number of purchases soon saturates: it grows fast up to around 10  outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or starts to drop.
For the experiment we consider only node pairs (u, v), where there were at least a total of 10  recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment using only recommendations from the same product group.
If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends, then the chances of success are slim.
So, how many recommendations are too many?
One the other hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with recommendations may have limited returns as well.
Now we look from the viewpoint of the sender.
Even more surprisingly, as more and more recommendations are received, their success decreases.
by our definition, only one of them receives a credit. 
One would  expect that a person is more likely to buy a product if she gets more recommendations.
We performed the experiment also for video and music, but the number of observations was too low and the measurements were noisy.
For these reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations becomes too small and the error bars too large.
For DVDs we observe an immediate and  consistent drop.
We construct the experiment in the following way.
