In contrast, if we consider the lag between the purchase and the first recommendation, only 23% of DVD purchases are made within a day, while the proportion stays the same for books.
This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 
At the same time, DVD  recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations, only one of which can result in a discount.
the difference between the time of purchase and the time the last recommendation was received for the product prior to the purchase (figure 8).
For DVDs 16%  purchases occur more than a week after last recommendation, while this drops to 10% for books.
We also measure the variation in intensity by time of day for three different activities in the recommendation system: recommendations (figure 9(a)), all purchases (figure 9(b)), and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount (figure 9(c)).
In contrast, for books, only 21% of purchases through  recommendations did not receive a discount.
This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailer"s website was low.
Individuals then often miss their chance of a discount, which is reflected in the high ratio (78%) of recommended DVD purchases that did not a get discount (see table 1, columns bb and be).
We study the time lag between the recommendation and the purchase of different product groups, effectively how long it takes a person to both receive a recommendation, consider it, and act on it.
The only small difference is that purchases reach a sharper peak in the afternoon (after 3pm Pacific Time, 6pm Eastern time).
Around  35%40% of book and DVD purchases occurred within a day after the last recommendation was received.
PURCHASES The recommendation referral program encourages people to purchase as soon as possible after they get a  recommendation, since this maximizes the probability of getting a  discount.
This reflects a greater likelihood for a person to receive multiple recommendations for a DVD than for a book.
The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures.
The recommendations and purchases follow the same  pattern.
Each is given as a total count by hour of day.
We present the histograms of the thinking time, i.e.
We use a bin size of 1 day.
