In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that  accompanies this hobby.
On average, only 2% of the  recommenders of a book received a discount because their  recommendation was accepted, and another 1% made a  recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount.
Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of fiction before reading it themselves, since the  recommendation must be made at the point of purchase.
Next, we measure the per category efficacy of  recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2).
BY BOOK CATEGORY Social networks are a product of the contexts that bring people together.
For example, in small world experiments, where participants attempt to reach a target individual through their chain of  acquaintances, profession trumped geography, which in turn was more useful in locating a target than attributes such as  religion or hobbies [9, 17].
Perhaps because of this, the rate of acceptance of orchid book  recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable or tomato growing. 
more or less influential than a recommendation for a  technical book, which may be made by a colleague at work or school.
Surprisingly, we find that the number of people  making personal recommendations was only a few times greater than the number of people posting a public review on the website.
In the context of product  recommendations, we can ask whether a recommendation for a work of fiction, which may be made by any friend or neighbor, is 234 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 5 Hour of the Day Recommendtions 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 4 Hour of the Day AllPurchases 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 Hour of the Day DiscountedPurchases (a) Recommendations (b) Purchases (c) Purchases with Discount Figure 9: Time of day for purchases and recommendations.
For example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong following in the US, and this is reflected in their frequency and success in recommendations.
The efficacy was a bit higher (around 3%) for non-fiction books dealing with personal and leisure pursuits, but is significantly higher in the professional and technical category.
We observe that fiction books have relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books have more  recommendations than reviews.
These results raise the interesting possibility that individuals have greater influence over one another in an organized context, for example through a  professional contact or a religious one.
Fiction encompasses categories such as Sci-Fi and Romance, as well as children"s and young adult books.
This could be in part attributed to the higher median price of medical books and technical books in general.
Fiction in general is not very effectively recommended, with only around 2% of recommenders succeeding.
In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower  recommendation effectiveness.
At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent â€˜shows" and online communities devoted entirely to orchids.
Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.
Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.
For clarity, we group the results by 4 different category types: fiction, personal/leisure, professional/technical, and  nonfiction/other.
This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less incentive to send recommendations.
We observe marked differences in the response to  recommendation for different categories of books.
Some contexts result in social ties that are more effective at conducting an action.
As we will see in  Section 6, a higher product price increases the chance that a recommendation will be accepted.
An analysis of other product types can be found in the extended version of the paper.
Medical books have nearly double the average rate of recommendation acceptance.
Another example is that of gardening.
One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than  technical books.
(a) shows the distribution of recommendations over the day, (b) shows all purchases and (c) shows only purchases that resulted in getting discount.
This could reflect several factors.
Table 2 shows recommendation trends for all top level book categories by subject.
Personal/Leisure encompasses everything from gardening, photography and cooking to health and religion.
First, we compare the relative number of  recommendations to reviews posted on the site (column cav/rp1 of  table 2).
There are exceptions of course.
