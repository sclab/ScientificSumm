From the original set of half a million products, we  compute a success rate s for the 48,218 products that had at least one purchase made through a recommendation and for which a price was given.
We use a regression of the following product  attributes to correlate them with recommendation success: • r: number of recommendations • ns: number of senders of recommendations • nr: number of recipients of recommendations • p: price of the product • v: number of reviews of the product • t: average product rating 235 category np n cc rp1 vav cav/ pm b ∗ 100 rp1 Books general 370230 2,860,714 1.87 5.28 4.32 1.41 14.95 3.12 Fiction Children"s Books 46,451 390,283 2.82 6.44 4.52 1.12 8.76 2.06** Literature & Fiction 41,682 502,179 3.06 13.09 4.30 0.57 11.87 2.82* Mystery and Thrillers 10,734 123,392 6.03 20.14 4.08 0.36 9.60 2.40** Science Fiction & Fantasy 10,008 175,168 6.17 19.90 4.15 0.64 10.39 2.34** Romance 6,317 60,902 5.65 12.81 4.17 0.52 6.99 1.78** Teens 5,857 81,260 5.72 20.52 4.36 0.41 9.56 1.94** Comics & Graphic Novels 3,565 46,564 11.70 4.76 4.36 2.03 10.47 2.30* Horror 2,773 48,321 9.35 21.26 4.16 0.44 9.60 1.81** Personal/Leisure Religion and Spirituality 43,423 441,263 1.89 3.87 4.45 1.73 9.99 3.13 Health Mind and Body 33,751 572,704 1.54 4.34 4.41 2.39 13.96 3.04 History 28,458 28,3406 2.74 4.34 4.30 1.27 18.00 2.84 Home and Garden 19,024 180,009 2.91 1.78 4.31 3.48 15.37 2.26** Entertainment 18,724 258,142 3.65 3.48 4.29 2.26 13.97 2.66* Arts and Photography 17,153 179,074 3.49 1.56 4.42 3.85 20.95 2.87 Travel 12,670 113,939 3.91 2.74 4.26 1.87 13.27 2.39** Sports 10,183 120,103 1.74 3.36 4.34 1.99 13.97 2.26** Parenting and Families 8,324 182,792 0.73 4.71 4.42 2.57 11.87 2.81 Cooking Food and Wine 7,655 146,522 3.02 3.14 4.45 3.49 13.97 2.38* Outdoors & Nature 6,413 59,764 2.23 1.93 4.42 2.50 15.00 3.05 Professional/Technical Professional & Technical 41,794 459,889 1.72 1.91 4.30 3.22 32.50 4.54** Business and Investing 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62** Science 25,697 271,391 2.64 2.41 4.30 2.42 28.00 3.90** Computers and Internet 18,941 375,712 2.22 4.51 3.98 3.10 34.95 3.61** Medicine 16,047 175,520 1.08 1.41 4.40 4.19 39.95 5.68** Engineering 10,312 107,255 1.30 1.43 4.14 3.85 59.95 4.10** Law 5,176 53,182 2.64 1.89 4.25 2.67 24.95 3.66* Nonfiction-other Nonfiction 55,868 560,552 2.03 3.13 4.29 1.89 18.95 3.28** Reference 26,834 371,959 1.94 2.49 4.19 3.04 17.47 3.21 Biographies and Memoirs 18,233 277,356 2.80 7.65 4.34 0.90 14.00 2.96 Table 2: Statistics by book category: np:number of products in category, n number of customers, cc percentage of customers in the largest connected component, rp1 av.
In section 5 we defined  recommendation success rate s as the ratio of the total number purchases made through recommendations and the number of senders of the recommendations.
The number of senders and receivers have large negative  coefficients, showing that successfully recommended products are more likely to be not so widely popular.

We decided to use this kind of normalization, rather than normalizing by the total number of recommendations sent, in order not to penalize communities where a few individuals send out many  recommendations (figure 2(b)).
The only two  attributes with a positive coefficient are the number of  recommendations and price.
This shows that more expensive and more recommended products have a higher success rate.
With the exception of the average rating, they are all significant.
We present a model which characterizes product  categories for which recommendations are more likely to be accepted.
They have relatively many recommendations with a small number of senders and receivers, which suggests a very dense  recommendation network where lots of recommendations were  exchanged between a small community of people.
These insights could be to marketers - personal  recommendations are most effective in small, densely connected communities enjoying expensive products.
For each coefficient we provide the standard error and the statistical significance level (**:0.01, *:0.1). 
SUCCESS We have examined the properties of recommendation  network in relation to viral marketing, but one question still remains: what determines the product"s viral marketing  success?
We fit the model using least squares and obtain the  coefficients βi shown on table 3.
The symbol ** denotes statistical significance at the 0.01 level, * at the 0.05 level.
Since the variables follow a heavy tailed distribution, we use the following model: s = exp( i βi log(xi) + i) where xi are the product attributes (as described on  previous page), and i is random error.
