We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with  recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.
Some services used by individuals to  communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the  communication.
In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth  advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.
These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot  completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.
Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.
It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an  anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.
At the same time the choice of products available to  consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than  traditional brick-and-mortar stores.
Google"s Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.
But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.
On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].
Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.
Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor  influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.
We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailer"s incentivised viral marketing program.
A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3].
Previously, a few in depth  studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).
Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top 10,000 tunes [1].
Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from  learning about new products.
Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.
We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.
While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects.
Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions" trusted reviewer network to construct an  algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals" probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.
The website gave discounts to customers  recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.
Several studies have attempted to model just this kind of network influence.
The problem is partly addressed by the advent of  online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.
Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a â€˜fat tail"  phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.
Viral marketing exploits existing social  networks by encouraging customers to share product  information with their friends.
For example, individuals" likelihood of  purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.
Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.
We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a  product.
With consumers showing increasing resistance to  traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including  viral marketing.
Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].
Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of  products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].
However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.
We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.
Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].
Moreover, the characteristics of  recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.
Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.
Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos [8] evaluate the efficiency of several  algorithms for maximizing the size of influence set given  various models of adoption.
We report on these and other findings in the following sections.
