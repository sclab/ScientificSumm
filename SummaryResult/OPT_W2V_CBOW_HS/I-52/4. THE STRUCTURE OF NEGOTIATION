Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A.
The previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations  sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
We now study acyclic preference relations that are defined formally as follows.
, an ∈ A, with n > 1, such that (ai, ai+1) ∈ R and (an, a1) ∈ R, with 1 ≤ i < n. Note that acyclicity prohibits pairs of arguments a, b such that a b and b a, ie., an acyclic preference relation disallows indifference.
An immediate consequence of the above is the following.
Then for any pair of arguments a, b ∈ A, such that (a, b) ∈ R, either (a, b) ∈ Def or (b, a) ∈ Def (or both).
Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A.
Another direct consequence of the above theorem is that in acyclic preference relations, arguments that support offers can participate in only one preferred extension.
Let o1, o2 ∈ O. o1, o2 ∈ Oa iff ∃ a1 ∈ F(o1), ∃ a2 ∈ F(o2), such that a1 and a2 are accepted and are indifferent w.r.t (i.e.
Theorem 2.
Using the above results we can prove the main theorem of this section that states that negotiating agents with acyclic preference relations do not have acceptable offers.
Let A, F, R, , Def be a negotiating agent such that A = AO and is an acyclic relation.
Definition 9 (Acyclic relation).
THEORIES In this section, we study the properties of the system  developed above.
Let A be a set of arguments such that A = AO.
We first show that the set Oa may contain several offers when their  corresponding accepted arguments are indifferent w.r.t the preference relation .
Consequently, the set of acceptable offers, Oa is empty as well. 
Let A be a set of arguments, R the  attacking relation of A defined as R ⊆ A × A, and an acyclic relation on A.
We first show that in the particular case where A = AO (ie.
We now present some results that demonstrate the  importance of indifference in negotiating agents, and more  specifically its relation to acceptable outcomes.
Then the preferred extensions of A, Def are pairwise disjoint w.r.t arguments of AO.
If the relation on A is acyclic, then each extension Ei of <A, Def>, |Ei| = 1.
If E is an extension of <A, Def>, then |E ∩ AO| = 1.
all of the agent"s arguments refer to offers), the corresponding argumentation system will return at least one non-empty preferred extension.
Then the set of accepted arguments w.r.t A, Def is emtpy.
Let A, Def an argumentation system such that A = AO.
Then the system returns at least one  extension E, such that |E| ≥ 1.
A relation R on a set A is acyclic if there is no sequence a1, a2, .
