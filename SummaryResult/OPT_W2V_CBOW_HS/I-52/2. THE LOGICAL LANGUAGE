The idea behind this  assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose only one at a given step of the dialogue.
As in [5], in what follows, we consider that the structure of the arguments is not known.
The second hypothesis says that  arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting.
Indeed, an  argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agent"s  beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an  argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments.
In what follows, the set Args(L) is then divided into two subsets: a subset Argso(L) of  arguments supporting offers, and a subset Argsb(L) of arguments supporting beliefs.
In what follows, we assume that the set Args(L) of arguments is finite, and each argument is attacked by a finite number of arguments. 
, on} of n offers is identified, such that oi, oj ∈ O such that oi ≡ oj.
Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the  arguments of Argsb(L).
The idea here is to return the strongest argument among these arguments.
Different arguments can be built from L. The set Args(L) will contain all those arguments.
a = a , a RL a • a ∈ Argso(L) and a ∈ Argsb(L) such that a RL a Note that the relation RL is not symmetric.
Since the knowledge bases from which arguments are built may be inconsistent, the arguments may be conflicting too.
Offers correspond to the different  alternatives that can be exchanged during a negotiation dialogue.
The third condition does not allow an argument in favor of an offer to attack an argument supporting a  belief.
In what follows, those conflicts will be captured by the  relation RL, thus RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L).
By argument, we mean a reason in believing or of doing something.
In [3], it has been argued that the selection of the best offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision problem.
In [4], it has been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for decision making, two kinds of arguments are distinguished: arguments supporting choices (or decisions), and arguments supporting beliefs.
Consequently, in a  negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally exchanged between agents.
This means that the offers are different.
This is due to the fact that arguments of Argsb(L) may be conflicting but not necessarily in a symmetric way.
For instance, if the agents try to decide the place of their next meeting, then the set O will contain different towns.
In what follows, L will denote a logical language, and ≡ is an equivalence relation associated with it.
Three assumptions are made on this relation: First the arguments supporting different offers are conflicting.
RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L) is a conflict relation among arguments such that: • ∀a, a ∈ Argso(L), s.t.
Moreover, it has been acknowledged that the two categories of arguments are formally defined in  different ways, and they play different roles.
From L, a set O = {o1, .
This avoids wishful thinking.
Formally: Definition 1.
Thus, Args(L) = Argso(L) ∪ Argsb(L).
