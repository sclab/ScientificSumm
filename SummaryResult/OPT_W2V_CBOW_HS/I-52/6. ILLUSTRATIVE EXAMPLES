Consequently, the offer o2 is acceptable and o1 is rejected.
In this case, it is clear that the two offers o1 and o2 are  nonsupported.
The following dialogue may take place between the two agents: P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, a1, o1, 2 C: m4 = C, a3, θ, 3 C: m5 = P, θ, o2, 4 At step 4 of the dialogue, the agent P receives the  argument a3 from P. Thus, its theory evolves as follows: AP = {a1, a2, a3}, RP = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, DefP = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}.
The only possible dialogues that may take place between the two agents are the following: P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, a1, o1, 2 C: m4 = C, a2, o2, 3 The second possible dialogue is the following: P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, a2, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, a1, o1, 2 C: m4 = C, θ, o2, 3 Both dialogues end with failure.
P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o1, 2 Note that in the above example, since there is no exchange of arguments, the theories of both agents do not change.
The theory of agent P is AP , FP , P , RP , DefP such that: AP = {a1, a2}, FP (o1) = {a1}, FP (o2) = {a2}, P = {(a1, a2)}, RP = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, DefP = {a1, a2}.
The theory of agent C is AC , FC , C , RC , DefC such that: AC = {a1, a2, a3}, FC (o1) = {a1}, FC (o2) = {a2}, C = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, RC = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, DefC = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}.
Let P and C be two agents, equipped with the same theory: A, F, , R, Def such that A = ∅, F(o1) = F(o2) = ∅, = ∅, R = ∅, Def = ∅.
At this step, the argument a1 which was accepted will become rejected, and the argument a2 which was at the beginning of the dialogue rejected will become  accepted.
The dialogue ends by returning this offer as an outcome. 
The argumentation system AP , DefP of this agent will return a1 as an accepted argument, and a2 as a rejected one.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 This dialogue ends with o1 as a compromise.
The theory of agent P is AP , FP , P , RP , DefP such that: AP = {a1, a2}, FP (o1) = {a1}, FP (o2) = {a2}, P = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, RP = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, DefP = {(a1, a2)}.
At this step 4, the offer o2 is acceptable for both agents, thus it is an optimal solution.
P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 This dialogue also ends with o2 as a compromise.
The argumentation system AP , DefP of this agent will return a1 as an accepted argument, and a2 as a rejected one.
The theory of agent C is AC , FC , C , RC , DefC such that: AC = {a1, a2}, FC (o1) = {a1}, FC (o2) = {a2}, C = {(a2, a1)}, RC = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, DefC = {a2, a1}.
Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers.
Consequently, the offer o2 is acceptable and o1 is rejected.
Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers.
P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o2, 2 This dialogue ends with o2 as a compromise.
Consequently, the offer o1 is acceptable and o2 is rejected.
Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers.
Consequently, the offer o1 is acceptable and o2 is rejected.
Thus, the offer o2 will be acceptable for the agent, whereas o1 will become rejected.
The argumentation system AC , DefC of this agent will return a3 and a2 as accepted arguments, and a1 as a rejected one.
The last possible dialgue is the following that ends with o1 as a  compromise.
The argumentation system AC , DefC of this agent will return a2 as an accepted argument, and a1 as a rejected one.
The negotiation fails because the agents have conflicting  preferences.
Let us now consider an example in which argumentation will allow agents to reach an agreement.
The proposed protocol (see Definition 16) will generate one of the following dialogues: 972 The Sixth Intl.
Note that in both dialogues, the theories of both agents do not change.
Example 7 (No argumentation).
The reason is that the exchanged arguments are already known to both agents.
Note that this solution is not considered as optimal since it is not an  acceptable offer for the agents.
Let us now consider the following example.
In this section we will present some examples in order to illustrate our general framework.
Example 9 (Dynamic theories).
Example 8 (Static theories).
