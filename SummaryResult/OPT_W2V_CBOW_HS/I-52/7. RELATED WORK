In that work, the author has emphasized the advantages of using  argumentation in negotiation dialogues, and a specific framework has been introduced.
For example the decision making mechanism proposed in [7] for the evaluation of arguments and  therefore of offers, which is based on a priority relation between mutually attacked arguments, can be captured by the  relation defeat proposed in our framework.
They have proposed an argumentation-based decision framework that is used by agents in order to choose the offer to propose or to accept during the dialogue.
The negotiation protocol is general as well.
Thus this framework can be instantiated in different ways by creating, in such manner, different specific argumentation-based  negotiation frameworks, all of them respecting the same  properties.
However, none of those proposals explain when arguments can be used within a  negotiation, and how they should be dealt with by the agent that receives them.
Moreover, a particular  framework for negotiation have been proposed.
In [8], the different types of arguments that are used in a negotiation dialogue, such as threats and rewards, have been discussed.
Even if all these frameworks are based on different logics, and use different definitions of arguments, they all have at their heart an  exchange of offers and arguments.
However, the notion of concession is not modeled in that framework, and it is not clear what is the status of the outcome of the dialogue.
In [2] a negotiation framework that fills the gap has been suggested.
A protocol that handles the  arguments was proposed.
Moreover, it is not clear how an agent chooses the offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue.
Another limitation of the above  frameworks is the fact that the argumentation frameworks they The Sixth Intl.
Argumentation has been integrated in negotiation  dialogues at the early nineties by Sycara [12].
Our framework is also a unified one because frameworks like the ones presented above can be represented within this framework.
In that work, agents are supposed to have a beliefs base and a goals base.
Our framework is more general since it does not impose any specific structure for the arguments, the offers, or the  beliefs.
This relation takes simultaneously into account the attacking and preference relations that may exist between two arguments. 
In [9, 13],  different other frameworks have been proposed.
Thus the protocol for handling  arguments was missing.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 973 use are quite poor, since they use a very simple  acceptability semantics.
In [1, 7], the authors have  focused mainly on this decision problem.
