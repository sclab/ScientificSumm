In [3, 7], the authors argued that selecting an offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision  making problem.
In this framework, a negotiation dialogue takes place between two agents on a set O of offers, whose structure is not known.
Integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a good means for supplying additional information and also helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments during a negotiation dialogue.
Section 5 defines formally an argumentation-based negotiation, shows how the theories of agents may evolve during a  dialogue, and how this evolution may influence the outcome of the dialogue.
A theory  consists of a set A of arguments whose structure and origin are not known, a function specifying for each possible offer in O, the arguments of A that support it, a non specified conflict relation among the arguments, and finally a preference  relation between the arguments.
Others have emphasized on the decision making problem.
Different approaches to automated negotiation have been investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which  usually assume complete information and unlimited  computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try to cope with these limitations [6], and argumentation-based approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the  importance of exchanging information and explanations between negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their  behaviors (e.g.
Roughly speaking, negotiation is a process aiming at  finding some compromise or consensus between two or several agents about some matters of collective agreement, such as pricing products, allocating resources, or choosing  candidates.
They have thus proposed an  argumentationbased decision model, and have shown how such a model can be related to the dialogue protocol.
This paper aims to propose a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of argumentation is formally analyzed, and where the existing systems can be restated.
In most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues.
Moreover, basic concepts in negotiation such as agreement (i.e.
The basic idea behind an  argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments, the  theories of the agents (i.e.
We show how an agent"s theory may evolve during a negotiation dialogue.
Each agent is supposed to have a theory represented in an abstract way.
They have shown how and when arguments in favor of offers can be computed and  exchanged.
We define formally the notions of concession, compromise, and optimal solution.
Negotiation models have been proposed for the design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with other agents for example, buying or selling products in  ecommerce.
The goal of a negotiation is to find among elements of O, an offer that satisfies more or less 967 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the preferences of both agents.
In section 4, we study the properties of these agents" theories.
It is not clear how argumentation can influence the outcome of the dialogue.
Then, we propose a protocol that  allows agents i) to exchange offers and arguments, and ii) to make concessions when necessary.
Consequently, the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets: acceptable, rejected, negotiable and non-supported offers.
Section 3 defines the agents as well as their theories.
Several proposals have been made in the literature for modeling such an approach.
Indeed, an offer supported by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by an agent, and can also make him reveal his goals or give up some of them.
Some researchers have mainly focused on relating argumentation with protocols.
an agent may concede a goal having a small priority), and consequently the outcome of the dialogue.
However, the agent may change its mind if it receives a strong argument in favor of this offer.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the logical language that is used in the rest of the paper.
We show that dialogues generated under such a protocol terminate, and even reach optimal solutions when they exist.
Indeed, the two first types of settings do not allow for the  addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers.
Two kinds of outcomes: optimal solution and compromise are defined, and we show when such outcomes are reached.
Section 6 illustrates our general framework through some examples.
Section 7 compares our formalism with existing ones.
For instance, an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for it.
These last are in a technical report that we will make available online at some later time. 
The status of each argument is defined using Dung"s acceptability semantics.
However, the work is still  preliminary.
optimal solutions, or compromise) and concession are neither defined nor studied.
their mental states) may evolve, and consequently, the status of offers may change.
Due to lack of space, the proofs are not  included.
Section 8 concludes and presents some perspectives.
