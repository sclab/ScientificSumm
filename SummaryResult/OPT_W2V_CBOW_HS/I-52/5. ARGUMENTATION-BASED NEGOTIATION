The second condition says that agent P starts the negotiation dialogue by presenting an offer.
condition says that an agent may send arguments in favor of offers, and in this case the offer should be stated in the same move.
, ml iff j, k < l, such that: • Offer(mj) = Offer(mk), and • Player(mj) = Player(mk) The idea here is that if the two agents present the same offer, then the dialogue should terminate, and there is no longer possible continuation of the dialogue.
In this section, we define formally a protocol that  generates argumentation-based negotiation dialogues between two negotiating agents P and C. The two agents  negotiate about an object whose possible values belong to a set O.
Besides, in this paper, we suppose that the preference relation i of an agent does not change during the dialogue.
Note that in the definition of Rt, the  relation RL is used to denote a conflict between exchanged arguments.
In some places, we can use for short the notation Oi t to denote the partition of the set O at step t for agent i.
In what follows, Oi t,x denotes the set of offers of type x, where x ∈ {a, n, r, ns}, of the agent i at step t of the  dialogue.
Let"s assume that this agent  receives the following argument {a, a → y} that justifies y.
5.1 Evolution of the theories Before defining formally the evolution of an agent"s theory, let us first introduce the notion of dialogue moves, or moves for short.
The offer o is an optimal solution at a step t ≥ 0 iff o ∈ OP t,a ∩ OC t,a Such a solution does not always exist since agents may have conflicting preferences.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 971 5.3 Negotiation dialogue Now that we have shown how the theories of the agents evolve during a dialogue, we are ready to define formally an argumentation-based negotiation dialogue.
a Defi t b with - Argument(mk) = b, k ≤ t, and Player(mk) = i - l ≤ t, Argument(ml) = a The offer o is said non-defendable otherwise and NDi t is the set of non-defendable offers of agent i at a step t. The Sixth Intl.
, ml Let D be the set of all possible dialogues.
In this case, we say that their best offers are no longer defendable.
Moreover, these theories may evolve during the dialogue.
, mi−1 • Target(mi) = mj such that j < i and Player(mi) = Player(mj) • If Argument(mi) = θ, then: - if Offer(mi) = θ then Argument(mi) ∈ F(Offer(mi)) - if Offer(mi) = θ then Argument(mi) Def Player(mi) i Argument(Target(mi)) • i, j ≤ l such that mi = mj • m ∈ M such that m is a legal continuation of m1, .

Let Ai t, Fi t , i t, Ri t, Defi t be the theory of agent i at a step t > 0 of the  dialogue.
A move is a tuple mi = pi, ai, oi, ti such that: • pi ∈ {P, C} • ai ∈ Args(L) ∪ θ1 1 In what follows θ denotes the fact that no argument, or no offer is given 970 The Sixth Intl.

Offer(ml) = Offer(mj), and Player(ml) = Player(mj).
, t, ai = Argument(mi)} ∪ A with A ⊆ Args(L) • Fi t = O → 2Ai t • i t = i 0 • Ri t = Ri 0 ∪ {(ai, aj) | ai = Argument(mi), aj = Argument(mj), i, j ≤ t, and ai RL aj} ∪ R with R ⊆ RL • Defi t ⊆ Ai t × Ai t The above definition captures the monotonic aspect of an argument.
If Outcome(d) = o, (o = θ), then ∃t ≤ l such that o ∈ OP t,x ∩ OC t,y, with x, y ∈ {a, n, ns}.
If Outcome(d) = θ, then ∀t ≤ l, • OP t,r = OC t,a ∪ OC t,n ∪ OC t,ns, and • OC t,r = OP t,a ∪ OP t,n ∪ OP t,ns. 
This, unknown at the beginning of the  dialogue argument, could give to this agent the possibility to defeat an argument that it could not by using its initial  arguments.
This condition allows to terminate the dialogue as soon as an offer is presented by both agents.
Argument, Offer, Target)  returns the player of the move (i.e.
This set O is supposed to be known and the same for both agents.
An argumentation-based negotiation dialogue d between two agents P and C is a non-empty sequence of moves m1, .
In case there is no such solution, we say that the negotiation fails.
, ml be a  argumentationbased negotiation dialogue.
A direct consequence of the above theorem is the following: Property 4.
Let o ∈ O such that ∃j ≤ t with Player(mj) = i and offer(mj) = o.
A move m is a legal continuation of a sequence of moves m1, .
It is clear that now P can build an argument, say {a, a → y, y → z} in favor of z.
The offer o is a concession for an agent i iff o ∈ Oi x such that ∃Oi y = ∅, and Oi y Oi x.
An argument that is accepted at step t of the dialogue by an agent may become rejected at step t + i. Consequently, the status of offers also change.
An agent can also send arguments in order to defeat arguments of the other agent.
its theory before the dialogue starts), is denoted by Ai 0, Fi 0, i 0, Ri 0, Defi 0 , with i ∈ {P, C}.
the argument of a move, i.e ai, the offer oi, and the target of the move, ti).
Note that when Outcome(d) = θ, the negotiation fails, and no agreement is reached by the two agents.
We show also that if the negotiation fails, then there is no possible solution.
, ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue.
If ∃t ≤ l such that OP t,a ∩ OC t,a = ∅, then Outcome(d) ∈ OP t,a ∩ OC t,a.
If Outcome(d) = θ, then ∀t ≤ l, OP t,x ∩ OC t,y = ∅, ∀ x, y ∈ {a, n, ns}.
Note that the set M is finite since Arg(L) and O are  assumed to be finite.
., mj be a sequence of moves.
In an argumentation setting, this means that the agent has already presented all its arguments supporting its best offers, and it has no counter argument against the ones presented by the other agent.
In other words, that  solution is a common agreement at a given step of the  dialogue.
The offer o is defendable by the agent i iff: • ∃a ∈ Fi t (o), and k ≤ t s.t.
The initial theory of an agent i, (i.e.
The outcome of a negotiation dialogue is computed as follows: Definition 17 (Dialogue outcome).
Formally: Definition 14 (Defendable offer).
Suppose that an agent P has the following propositional knowledge base: ΣP = {x, y → z}.
, ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue.
Thus, agents make concessions by proposing/accepting less preferred offers.
This condition takes also into account the concessions that an agent will have to make if it was established that a concession is the only option for it at the current state of the dialogue.
We show also that the proposed dialogue protocol is sound in the sense that, if a dialogue returns a solution, then that solution is for sure a compromise.
Thus, in order to recognize such conflicts, we have supposed that the set RL is known to the agents.
Let O be a set of offers, and o ∈ O.
Argument(mk) = a, or • ∃a ∈ At \Fi t (o) s.t.
During a negotiation dialogue, agents exchange first their most preferred offers, and if these last are rejected, they make concessions.
The theory of an agent i at a step t > 0 is: Ai t, Fi t , i t, Ri t, Defi t such that: • Ai t = Ai 0 ∪ {ai, i = 1, .
., ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue.
Let m1, .
The idea is that if an agent receives an argument from another agent, it will add the new argument to its theory.
Note that we have: not(Oi t,x ⊆ Oi t+1,x).
That means for example that some offers could move from the set Oa to the set Or and vice-versa.
Indeed, an argument cannot be removed.
Let o ∈ O be an offer.
The  outcome of this dialogue, denoted Outcome, is Outcome(d) = Offer(ml) iff ∃j < l s.t.
For simplicity reasons, we assume that this set does not change during the dialogue.
∀di ∈ D, the argumentation-based  negotiation di terminates.
Note that new conflicts may arise between the original arguments of the agent and the ones that emerge after adding the received arguments to its theory.
, l, mi is a legal continuation of m1, .
Thus, the sets Oa, Or, On, and Ons may change from one step of the dialogue to another.
Worst yet, they may have different  arguments in favor of the same offers.
However, if Outcome(d) = θ, the negotiation succeeds, and a solution that is either optimal or a compromise is found.
Let us take the following example: Example 6.
In what follows, we will discuss the different kinds of solutions that may be reached in a negotiation.
The reason is that, such a conflict may not be in the set Ri of the agent i.
In a similar way, if a received argument is in conflict with the arguments of the agent i, then those conflicts are also added to its relation Ri .
Note that, in the first turn, we suppose that the agent does not present an argument.
Indeed, arguments are exchanged as soon as a conflict appears.
Let M denote the set of all the moves that can be built from {P, C}, Arg(L), O .
The first one is the optimal  solution.
As a direct consequence of the evolution of the sets Ai and Ri , the defeat relation Defi is also updated.
This allows us to capture the situation where an agent is able to prove an argument that it was unable to prove before, by incorporating in its beliefs some  information conveyed through the exchange of arguments with another agent.
Note that the two theories may be different in the sense that the agents may have different sets of arguments, and different  preference relations.
The last condition ensures that all the possible legal moves have been presented.
This could even lead to a change of the status of these initial arguments and this change would lead to the one of the associated offers" status.
This assumption is made for strategical purposes.
Moreover, since an argument may bring new information for the agent, thus new arguments can emerge.
Those new conflicts should also be considered.
The first condition says that the two agents take turn.
By agreement, one means a solution that satisfies to the largest possible  extent the preferences of both agents.
The agents are equipped with theories denoted respectively AP , FP , P , RP , DefP , and AC , FC , C , RC , DefC .
The third condition ensures that agents exchange their best  offers, but never the rejected ones.
An optimal solution is the best offer for both agents.
For that  purpose, we need to define first the notion of a legal  continuation.
Otherwise, Outcome(d) = θ.
5.2 The notion of agreement As said in the introduction, negotiation is a process aiming at finding an agreement about some matters.
Definition 16 (Argumentation-based negotiation).
Let us now see how an agent"s theory evolves and why.
From this base one cannot deduce z.
However, its status may change.
The above result is of great importance, since it shows that the proposed protocol avoids loops, and dialogues terminate.
The next condition prevents repeating the same move.
The fourth condition ensures that the moves are legal.
Let d = m1, .
The fifth condition allows agents to backtrack.
Another important result shows that the proposed protocol ensures to reach an optimal solution if it exists.
Let d = m1, .
Of course, as we have shown in a previous section, an agent may have several good or acceptable offers.
Let d = m1, .
In this case, the agent chooses one of them randomly.
Let d = m1, .
