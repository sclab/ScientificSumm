In the realm of software architectures, the paper proposes a connector-based model of multi-agent interactions which attempts to identify the essential structure underlying multi-agent interactions.
The social stance advocated by institutional frameworks and most multi-agent system methodologies has resulted in a wide spectrum of organizational and communicative  abstractions which have found currency in several programming frameworks and software platforms.
The main hypothesis motivating this paper is that the variety of multi-agent  interaction mechanisms - both, organizational and  communicative, share a common semantic core.
The proposed model is intended as the  abstract machine of an organizational programming language which allows programmers to accommodate an open set of interaction mechanisms.
Still, these tools and frameworks are designed to support a limited range of  interaction capabilities that constrain developers to a fixed set of particular, pre-defined abstractions.
Furthermore, the paper also provides this model with a formal execution semantics which describes the dynamics of social interactions.
