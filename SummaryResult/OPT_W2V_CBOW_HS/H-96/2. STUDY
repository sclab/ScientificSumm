The subjects were divided into the two groups depending on their search experience, how often they searched and the types of searches they performed.
The tasks were phrased in the form of simulated work task situations [2], i.e., short search scenarios that were designed to reflect real-life search situations and allow subjects to develop personal assessments of relevance.
They were asked to read the task, place themselves in the situation it described and find the information they felt was required to complete the task.
Subjects were not chosen and classified into their groups until they had completed an entry questionnaire that asked them about their search experience and computer use.
These subjects were not involved in the main experiment.
In our pilot tests (and in a posteriori analysis of the main experiment results) we verified that subjects reporting of individual task complexity matched our estimation of the complexity of the task.
We only report on the results from the ERF and IRF systems as these are the only pertinent ones for this paper.
One system suggested terms based on the user"s interaction (IRF), the other used Explicit RF (ERF) asking the user to explicitly indicate relevant material.
In Appendix A we show the complete interface to the IRF system with the document representations marked and in Appendix B we show a fragment from the ERF interface with the checkboxes used by searchers to indicate relevant information.
48 subjects were selected from this set with the aim of populating two groups, each with 24 subjects: inexperienced (infrequent/ inexperienced searchers) and experienced (frequent/ experienced searchers).
This presentation of progressively more information from documents to aid relevance assessments has been shown to be effective in earlier work [14, 16].
Interacting with a representation guides searchers to a different representation from the same document, e.g., moving the mouse over a document title displays a summary of the document.
Throughout the night they seem to be complaining about everything they can, reducing the credibility of their earlier statements so you decide to research which factors actually are important in determining the price of petrol in the UK.
Unaware of any major differences, you decide to find out how and why petrol prices vary worldwide.
Document representations include the document title and a summary of the document; a list of top-ranking sentences (TRS) extracted from the top documents retrieved, scored in relation to the query, a sentence in the document summary, and each summary sentence in the context it occurs in the document (i.e., with the preceding and following sentence).
The average age of the subjects was 22.83 years (maximum 51, minimum 18, Ïƒ = 5.23 years) and 75% had a university diploma or a higher degree.
Subjects attempted one task of each complexity, 2 The main experiment from which these results are drawn had a third comparator system which had a different interface.
Subjects were told that their interaction may be used by the IRF system to help them as they searched.
The results of the main experiment [13] indicated that these two systems were comparable in terms of effectiveness.
By developing tasks of different complexity we can assess how the nature of the task affects the subjects" interactive behaviour and hence the evidence supplied to IRF algorithms.
2.4 Methodology The experiment had a factorial design; with 2 levels of search experience, 3 experimental systems (although we only report on the findings from the ERF and IRF systems) and 3 levels of search task complexity.
In each experiment: i. the subject was welcomed and asked to read an introduction to the experiments and sign consent forms.
System logging was also used to record subject interaction.
2.1.1 Interface Overview In both systems, retrieved documents are represented at the interface by their full-text and a variety of smaller, query-relevant representations, created at retrieval time.
HC Task: High Complexity Whilst having dinner with an American colleague, they comment on the high price of petrol in the UK compared to other countries, despite large volumes coming from the same source.
Next to each document representation are checkboxes that allow searchers to mark individual representations as relevant; marking a representation is an indication that its contents are relevant.
You decide to find out how the price of petrol has changed in the UK in recent years.
In this section we describe the user study conducted to address our research questions.
A tutorial carried out prior to the experiment allowed subjects to use a non-feedback version of the system to attempt a practice task before using the first experimental system.
Task complexity was varied according to the methodology described in [1], specifically by varying the number of potential information sources and types of information required, to complete a task.
the subject was given a tutorial on the interface, followed by a training topic on a version of the interface with no RF.
v. the subject was asked to perform the search and was given 15 minutes to search.
the subject completed a post-experiment questionnaire and participated in a post-experiment interview.
The subject could terminate a search early if they were unable to find any more information they felt helped them complete the task.
To the implicit RF system each interaction with a representation is interpreted as an implicit indication of interest in that representation; interacting with a representation is assumed to be an indication that its contents are relevant.
2.1 Systems Our study used two systems both of which suggested new query terms to the user.
As described in [1] task complexity is a variable that affects subject perceptions of a task and their interactive behaviour, e.g., subjects perform more filtering activities with highly complex search tasks.
For each topic, three versions of each work task situation were devised, each version differing in their predicted level of task complexity.
47.91% of subjects had, or were pursuing, a qualification in a discipline related to Computer Science.
after completion of the search, the subject was asked to complete a post-search questionnaire.
To the searcher this is a way they can find out more information from a potentially interesting source.
Each summary sentence and top-ranking sentence is regarded as a representation of the document.
However, as you have not been driving for long, you are unaware of any major changes in price.
We devised six search topics (i.e., applying to university, allergies in the workplace, art galleries in Rome, Third Generation mobile phones, Internet music piracy and petrol prices) based on pilot testing with a small representative group of subjects.
We used the Web as the test collection in this study and Google1 as the underlying search engine.
This set of instructions was written to ensure that each subject received precisely the same information.
MC Task: Moderate Complexity Whilst out for dinner one night, one of your friends" guests is complaining about the price of petrol and the factors that cause it.
No guidelines were given to subjects when choosing a task other than they could not choose a task from any topic more than once.
Task complexity was rotated by the experimenter so each subject attempted one high complexity task, one moderate complexity task and one low complexity task.
the subject was given three task sheets and asked to choose one task from the six topics on each sheet.
The default display contains the list of top-ranking sentences and the list of the first ten document titles.
2.2 Tasks Search tasks were designed to encourage realistic search behaviour by our subjects.
Experiments lasted between  oneand-a-half and two hours, dependent on variables such as the time spent completing questionnaires.
All were familiar with Web searching, and some with searching in other domains.
2.1.3 Implicit RF system This system makes inferences about searcher interests based on the information with which they interact.
This contained questions about the subject"s education, general search experience, computer experience and Web search experience.
Each subject carried out three tasks, one on each system.
The query modification terms are selected using the same algorithm as in the Explicit RF system.
The order in which systems were used and search tasks attempted was randomised according to a Latin square experimental design.
They were not told which behaviours would be used or how it would be used.
the subject was asked to complete an introductory questionnaire.
This system was used as a baseline against which the IRF system could be compared.
The subjects were a mixture of students, researchers, academic staff and others, with different levels of computer and search experience.
Therefore the only difference between the systems is how relevance is communicated to the system.
Subjects attempted three search tasks: one high complexity, one moderate complexity and one low complexity2 .
Figure 1 shows the task statements for three levels of task complexity for one of the six search topics.
The searcher has the responsibility for choosing which, if any, of these terms to add to the query.
LC Task: Low Complexity While out for dinner one night, your friend complains about the rising price of petrol.
Both systems used the same term suggestion algorithm, [15], and used a common interface.
switched systems after each task and used each system once.
Only the representations marked relevant by the user are used for suggesting new query terms.
the remaining tasks were attempted by the subject, following steps v. and vi.
2.3 Subjects 156 volunteers expressed an interest in participating in our study.
Both systems provide an interactive query expansion feature by suggesting new query terms to the user.
Questionnaires used Likert scales, semantic differentials and  openended questions to elicit subject opinions [4].
The searcher can also add or remove terms from the query at will.
As described in Section 2.1.1 interacting with a representation highlights a new representation from the same document.
Varying task complexity (Petrol Prices topic).
Subjects were offered a 5 minute break after the first hour.
We now describe the findings of our analysis. 
2.1.2 Explicit RF system This version of the system implements explicit RF.
