However, as we argue in this paper, few existing representation languages are both modular, compact and computationally grounded on the one hand, and allow for representing properties of both knowledge and strategic ability, on the other.
Lately, an increasing amount of research has focused on higher level representation languages for models of such logics, motivated mainly by the need for compact representations, and for representations that correspond more closely to the actual systems which are modeled.
We start with computation tree logic CTL, then we add knowledge (CTLK), and then we discuss two variants of alternating-time temporal logic (ATL): one for the perfect, and one for the imperfect information case.
Multi-agent systems are open systems, in the sense that agents interact with an environment only partially known in advance.
In this paper we present a new class of representations for  models of open multi-agent systems, which are modular, compact and come with an implicit methodology for modeling and designing actual systems.
Thus, we need representations of models of multi-agent systems which are modular, in the sense that a  component, such as an agent, can be replaced, removed, or added, without major changes to the representation of the whole model.
First, in Section 2, we present the background of our work - that is, logics that combine time, knowledge, and strategies.
In Section 3, we present an overview of representations that have been used for modeling and model checking systems in which time, action (and possibly knowledge) are important; we mention especially  representations used for theoretical analysis.
The semantics of logics like the ones presented in Section 2 are usually defined over explicit models (Kripke structures) that enumerate all possible (global) states of the system.
We point out that the  compact and/or grounded representations of temporal models do not play their role in a satisfactory way when agents" strategies are considered.
Logic has been used to represent and reason about, e.g., knowledge [7], time [6], cooperation and strategic ability [3].
The structure of the paper is as follows.
Thus, we usually need representations that are more compact.
The logical foundations of multi-agent systems have received much attention in recent years.
This calls for a semantics which is more grounded, in the sense that the correspondence between elements of the model, and the entities that are modeled, is more immediate.
Finally, in Section 4, we present our framework of modular interpreted systems (MIS), and show where it fits in the picture.
Another reason for using a more specialized class of models is that general Kripke structures do not always give enough help in terms of methodology, both at the stage of design, nor at  implementation.
More precisely: modal logics that combine branching time, knowledge, and strategies under  incomplete information.
We conclude with a somewhat surprising hypothesis, that model checking ability under imperfect information for MIS can be computationally cheaper than model checking perfect information.
Until now, almost all complexity results were distinctly in favor of perfect information strategies (and the others were indifferent). 
However, enumerating these states is one of the things one mostly wants to avoid, because there are too many of them even for simple systems.
