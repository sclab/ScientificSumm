Having set ti to α for i in Nc means that any node in N is at least as well off lowering its threshold and replicating as bidding α to some node in Nc to make it replicate, so we may disregard the latter as a profitable strategy.
Ii tells us whether player i replicates the object or not, bi is the payment player i makes to player vi, and Ri is the total amount of bids received by player i.
If node i replicates the object, j is the  nearest node to i among the other nodes that replicate the object, and dij < α in a Nash equilibrium, then i should have a threshold at 25 least (α − dij).
The idea is to look at each node i in No and distribute the minimum payment needed to make i replicate the object among the nodes that access the object from i.
(10) The cost of social optimum for the payment game is same as that for the basic game, since the net payments made cancel out.
It also does not have incentive to reduce bj since the node where j accesses does not replicate and j has to replicate the object or to access the next closest replica, which costs at least the same from the definition of bj .
For each i in No, and for each j in Qi, we define δj = min{α, min k∈No−{i} djk} − dji (11) Note that δj is the difference between j"s cost for accessing the replica at i and j"s next best option among replicating the object and accessing some replica other than i.
4.1 Game Model The new game, which we refer to as the payment game, allows each player to offer a payment to another player to give the latter incentive to replicate the object.
Next we prove that indeed the payment game always has a strategy profile that  implements the socially optimal configuration as a Nash equilibrium.
For the thresholds, we have: ti = α if i ∈ Nc;Èj∈Qi bj if i ∈ No.
No player has incentive to deviate, so the current configuration is a Nash equilibrium.
In the socially optimal configuration, dij ≤ α for all j in Qi.
It is easy to see that cost of φopt minus cost of φnew is at least: (α + j∈Qi dij) − (di + j∈Qi min{α, min k∈No−{i} dik}) = α − di − j∈Qi δj > 0, which contradicts the optimality of φopt.
For each i in No, bi = 0 and for each j in Qi, j bids to i (i.e., vj = i) the amount: bj = max{0, δj − i/(|Qi| + 1)}, j ∈ Qi (12) where i = Èj∈Qi δj − α + di ≥ 0 and |Qi| is the cardinality of Qi.

vi specifies the player to whom i makes a bid, bi ≥ 0 is the value of the bid, and ti ≥ 0 denotes a threshold for payments beyond which i will replicate the object.
By observation 1, to ensure that each i in No does not deviate, we require that if is the nearest node to i in No, then Èj∈Qi bj is at least (α − di ).
Let No be the set of nodes that replicate the object and Nc = N − No be the rest of the nodes.
Consider the new configuration φnew wherein i does not replicate and each node in Qi chooses its next best strategy (either replicating or accessing the replica at some node in No − {i}).
Therefore, each node i ∈ No does not have incentive to change ti since i loses its payments received or there is no change, and i does not have incentive to bi since it replicates the object.
To compute the payoffs given the outcome, we must now take into account the payments a node makes, in addition to the placement costs and access costs of the basic game.
Since no one has an incentive to deviate, the configuration is a Nash equilibrium.
Therefore, the price of anarchy of the payment game is at least that of the basic game.
In fact, Appendix B shows that the PoA of the payment game can be more than that of the basic game in a given topology.
Its net payment is biIvi − RiIi.
A node i replicates the object if and only if Ri ≥ ti, that is, the amount of bids it receives is greater than or equal to its threshold.
We make the rule that if a node i makes a bid to another node j and j replicates the object, then i must pay j the amount bi.
Otherwise, it cannot collect enough payment to compensate for the cost of replicating the object and is better off accessing the replica at j. THEOREM 3.
It is defined as Ci(S) = αij Ii + wij di (i,j)(1 − Ii) + biIvi − RiIi.
Also, for each i in No, let Qi denote the set of nodes that access the object from i, not including i itself.
A node that replicates the object does not have incentive to change its strategy: changing the threshold does not decrease its cost, and it would have to pay at least α to access a remote replica or  incentivize a nearby node to cache.
(13) This fully specifies the strategy profile of the nodes, and it is easy to see that the outcome is indeed the socially optimal configuration.
We want to find a set of payments and thresholds that makes this configuration implementable.
The total cost incurred by each node is the sum of its placement cost, access cost, and net payment.
Also, for all i, bi = 0.
The payment necessary for another server to place a replica is at least α.
By our rules, a server node i pays bi to node vi if vi replicates the object, and receives a payment of Ri if it replicates the object itself.
For each i ∈ No, let be the nearest node to i in No.
We then present an important positive result - in the  payment game the socially optimal configuration can always be  implemented by a Nash equilibrium.
The optimistic price of anarchy in the payment game is therefore always one.
Next, we verify that the strategies stipulated constitute a Nash equilibrium.
In addition, we still place replicas at each node in No − {i}.
Its total cost is 2α, the same as in the socially optimal configuration shown in Figure 2(b).
Let Ii denote the corresponding indicator variable, that is, Ii equals 1 if i replicates the object, and 0 otherwise.
We can easily check that j∈Qi bj ≥ j∈Qi δj − |Qi| i |Qi| + 1 = α − di + i |Qi| + 1 ≥ α − di .
In the payment game, there is always a pure  strategy Nash equilibrium that implements the social optimum  configuration.
Otherwise, i will raise ti above Èj∈Qi bj so that it does not replicate and instead accesses the replica at .
No player has incentive to deviate, so this strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. 
The strategy for each player i is specified by a triplet (vi, bi, ti) ∈ {N, Ê+, Ê+}.
Any configuration that is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the basic game is also a pure strategy Nash  equilibrium in the payment game.
(of claim) Assume the contrary, that is, Èj∈Qi δj < α − di .
For each node i replicating the object, set its threshold ti to 0; everyone else has threshold α.
Given a strategy profile, the outcome of the game is the set of tuples {(Ii, vi, bi, Ri)}.
We first present the following observation, which is used in the proof, about thresholds in the payment game.
In this section, we present an extension to the basic game with payments and analyze the price of anarchy and the optimistic price of anarchy of the game.
Therefore it is better off keeping its threshold and bid at 0 and replicating the object.
In addition, we use Ri to denote the total amount of bids received by a node i (Ri = Èj:vj =i bj).
We know from the counterexample in Figure 2 that this is not guaranteed in the the basic game.
We set bids as follows.
4.2 Analysis In analyzing the payment model, we first show that a Nash  equilibrium in the basic game is also a Nash equilibrium in the payment game.
Each node j in Nc has no incentive to change tj since changing tj does not reduce its cost.
The same argument holds for A because of symmetry in the graph.
Lowering its threshold does not decrease its cost, since all bi are zero.
Consider any Nash equilibrium configuration in the  basic game.
B does not have an incentive to deviate, since accessing the remote replica does not decrease its cost.
Suppose node B"s neighbors each decide to pay node B an amount 2/n.
It is clear that δj ≥ 0.
A node that is not replicating the object can access the object  remotely at a cost less than or equal to α.
The cost of replication is shared among the nodes paying the server that replicates the object.
If j does not replicate the object, i does not pay j.
In this analysis we use α to represent αij .
Consider the socially optimal configuration φopt.
Now let us look at what happens to the example shown in  Figure 2 in the best case.
Then, Èj∈Qi δj ≥ α − di .
