We have many more experimental results that we  unfortunately did not have space for but that reinforce the notion that RTC is highly robust: with just a few judgments per topic, we can accurately assess the confidence in any  pairwise comparison of systems.
The confidence estimates of RTC, in addition to being  accurate, provide a guide for obtaining additional judgments: focus on judging documents from the lowest-confidence  comparisons.
In this work we have offered the first formal definition of the common idea of reusability of a test collection and presented a model that is able to achieve reusability with very small sets of relevance judgments.
The model we presented in Section 3 is by no means the only possibility for creating a robust test collection.
Table 2 and Figure 2 together show how biased a small set of judgments can be: MTC is dramatically overestimating confidence and is much less accurate than RTC, which is able to remove the bias to give a robust evaluation.
We see further use for this method in scenarios such as web retrieval in which the corpus is frequently changing.
A  simpler expert aggregation model might perform as well or  better (though all our efforts to simplify failed).

It could be applied to evaluation on a dynamic test collection as defined by Soboroff [18].
Additionally, it will be worthwhile to investigate the issue of overfitting: the circumstances it occurs under and what can be done to prevent it.
In addition to expert aggregation, we could estimate probabilities by  looking at similarities between documents.
As time goes on, the number of judgments grows until there is 100% confidence in every evaluation-and there is a full test collection for the task.
The results are highly consistent across data sets.
This is an obvious area for future exploration.
In the meantime, capping  confidence estimates at 95% is a hack that solves the problem.
