We propose a simple approach to  determine a revenue-optimal ranking rule within our family,  taking into account effects on advertiser satisfaction and user experience.
We find that in general neither of these is necessarily revenue-optimal in  equilibrium, and that the choice of ranking rule can be guided by considering the correlation between bidders" values and click-through rates.
Advertisers are typically ranked according to a score that takes into account their bids and potential  clickthrough rates.
We consider a family of ranking rules that contains those typically used to model Yahoo!
Keyword auctions lie at the core of the business models of today"s leading search engines.
bid and click-through rate data for a high-volume keyword.
Advertisers bid for  placement alongside search results, and are charged for clicks on their ads.
We illustrate the approach using Monte-Carlo simulations based on distributions fitted to Yahoo!
and Google"s auction designs as special cases.
