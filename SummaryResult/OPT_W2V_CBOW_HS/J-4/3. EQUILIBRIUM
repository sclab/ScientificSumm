It is straightforward to adapt his analysis to the case where bidders are assigned arbitrary weights and have separable click-through rates.2 As a result we find that in symmetric equilibrium, bidders are ranked in order of decreasing wsvs.
The smallest possible bid profile that can arise in  symmetric equilibrium is given by the recursion xsws+1bs+1 = (xs − xs+1)ws+1vs+1 + xs+1ws+2bs+2.
Multiplying each of the inequalities (4) by the  corresponding es/ws to obtain total payments, and summing over all positions, we obtain a total equilibrium revenue of KX s=1 KX t=s wt+1 ws es(xt − xt+1)vt+1.
In a symmetric equilibrium, inequality (1) holds for all s, t rather than just for t > s. So for all s and all t = s, we have esxs „ vs − ws+1 ws bs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws bt+1 « , 51 or equivalently xs(wsvs − ws+1bs+1) ≥ xt(wsvs − wt+1bt+1).
To be clear, although the auctioneer only has access to the bids bs and not the values vs, in symmetric equilibrium the bids are such that ranking according to wsbs is equivalent to ranking according to wsvs.
Varian does a thorough analysis of the properties of  symmetric equilibrium, assuming ws = es = 1 for all bidders.
esxs „ vs − ws+1 ws bs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws bt+1 « ∀t > s (1) esxs „ vs − ws+1 ws bs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt ws bt « ∀t < s (2) Inequalities (1) and (2) state that bidder s does not prefer a lower or higher position to his own, respectively.
This is an appropriate selection for our purposes: by optimizing revenue in this equilibrium, we are optimizing a lower bound on the revenue in any  symmetric equilibrium.
In this work we assume that bidders are playing the smallest symmetric equilibrium.
[3] note that this equilibrium arises if agents are raising their bids to increase the payments of those above them, a practice which is believed to be common in actual keyword auctions.
In this case the recursion yields xsws+1bs+1 = K(r)−1 X t=s (xt − xt+1)wt+1vt+1 + xK(r)r and the revenue formula is adapted similarly.
Edelman, Ostrovsky, and Schwarz [3] introduced a refinement of Nash equilibrium called locally envy-free equilibrium that is more tractable to analyze; Varian [11] independently  proposed this solution concept and called it symmetric  equilibrium.
(5) To summarize, the minimum possible revenue in symmetric equilibrium can be computed as follows, given the agents" relevance-value pairs (es, vs): first rank the agents in  decreasing order of wsvs, and then evaluate (5).
With a reserve score of r, it follows from inequality (3) that no bidder with wsvs < r would want to participate in the auction.
Varian [11] provides some empirical  evidence that Google bid data agrees well with the hypothesis that bidders are playing a symmetric equilibrium.
Let K(r) be the number of bidders with wsvs ≥ r, and assume it is at most K. We can impose a reserve score of r by introducing a bidder with value r and weight 1, and making him the first excluded bidder (who in symmetric equilibrium bids truthfully).
Unraveling the recursion yields xsws+1bs+1 = KX t=s (xt − xt+1)wt+1vt+1.
2 If we redefine wsvs to be vs and wsbs to be bs, we  recover Varian"s setup and his original analysis goes through unchanged. 
The base case of the  recursion occurs for s = K, where we find that the first excluded bidder bids his true value, as in the original analysis.
It can be hard to derive any theoretical insight into the properties of these Nash equilibria-multiple allocations of positions to bidders can potentially arise in equilibrium [2].
As a result it is reasonable to assume that if bids  stabilize, bidders should be playing best-responses to each other"s bids [2, 3, 11].
We consider the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of the  auction game.
The  motivation for this choice is that in a keyword auction, bidders are allowed to continuously adjust their bids over time, and hence obtain estimates of their profits in various positions.
Formally, in a Nash equilibrium of this game the following inequalities hold.
(4) Agent s"s total expected payment is es/ws times the  quantity on the left-hand side of (4).
This is a full-information concept.
