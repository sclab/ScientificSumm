Absent this  regularity condition, the optimization problem seems quite difficult because it is so general: we need to maximize expected  revenue over the space of all functions g. To simplify matters, we now restrict our attention to the family of weights ws = eq s for q ∈ (−∞, +∞).
However, unlike in the incomplete information setting, here we are constrained to ranking rules that correspond to a certain weighting scheme ws ≡ g(es).
Note though that with perfect correlation, there are If a good estimate of f is available, Monte-Carlo  simulations can be used to estimate the revenue curve as a function of q, and the optimum can be located.
We are interested in setting the weights w to achieve  optimal expected revenue.
The  auctioneer chooses a function g so that the weighting scheme is ws ≡ g(es).
To see how tuning q can improve matters, consider again the equilibrium revenue: R(q) = KX s=1 KX t=s „ et+1 es «q es(xt − xt+1)vt+1.
52 and sum over all agents to obtain the objective Z ∞ 0 Z ∞ 0 " NX s=1 KX k=1 esxkψ(es, vs)Qsk(e, v; w) # f(e, v) dv de, where ψ is the virtual valuation ψ(es, vs) = vs − 1 − F(vs|es) f(vs|es) .
We do not consider weights that also depend on the agents" bids because this would invalidate the  equilibrium analysis of the previous section.4 A pool of N bidders is then obtained by i.i.d.
4 The analysis does not generalize to weights that depend on bids.
There is no weighting scheme g such that the virtual score equals the score, for any density f. Proof.
Of course, to rank bidders by virtual score, we only need g(es)vs = h(esψ(es, vs)) for some monotonically increasing transformation h. (A necessary condition for this is that ψ(es, vs) be increasing in vs for all es.)
It then follows from (7) that q = 0 will yield more revenue in equilibrium than q = 1.5 5 It may appear that this contradicts the revenue-equivalence theorem [7, 9], because mechanisms that always lead to the same allocation in equilibrium should yield the same  revenue.
Note that the total payment of agent s in equilibrium is esxs ws+1 ws bs+1 = KX t=s es(xt − xt+1) wt+1 ws vt+1 = esxsvs − Z vs 0 KX k=1 esxkQsk(es, e−s, y, v−s; w) dy.
The derivation then continues just as in the case of a  singleitem auction [7, 9].
In this case, rank-by-bid will always lead to the same  allocation as rank-by-revenue, and bidders will always be ranked in decreasing order of relevance.
draws of value-relevance pairs from a common probability density f(es, vs).
Similarly, if bidders are ranked in increasing order of relevance,  increasing q slightly will yield an improvement.
(7) If the bidders are ranked in decreasing order of relevance, then et es ≤ 1 for t > s and decreasing q slightly without affecting the allocation will increase revenue.
We remark that the virtual score cannot be reproduced exactly via a weighting scheme.
Let Qsk(e, v; w) = 1 if agent s obtains slot k in equilibrium under weighting scheme w, where e = (e1, .
Note that it covers rank-by-bid (q = 0) and rank-by-revenue (q = 1) as special cases.
Assume there is a g such that eψ(e, v) = g(e)v. (The subscript s is suppressed for clarity.)
The revenue to the auctioneer is then the revenue generated in symmetric equilibrium under weighting scheme w. This  assumes the auctioneer is patient enough not to care about revenue until bids have stabilized.
Let ¯v be such that F(¯v|e) < 1; under the assumption of full support, there is always such a ¯v.
According to this analysis, we should rank bidders by  virtual score esψ(es, vs) to optimize revenue (and exclude any bidders with negative virtual score).
Integrating (6) with respect to v from 0 to ¯v, we find that the left-hand side converges whereas the right-hand side diverges, a contradiction.
The problem of finding an optimal weighting scheme can be formulated as an optimization problem very similar to the one derived by Myerson [9] for the single-item auction case (with incomplete information).
Now suppose there is perfect positive correlation between value and relevance.
We take the expectation of this payment, 3 Hal Varian suggested to us that bidding credits could be used to affect revenue in keyword auctions, which prompted us to look into this connection.
This is equivalent to d dv log(1 − F(v|e)) = h(e)/v, (6) where h(e) = (g(e)/e−1)−1 .
It is unclear whether an equilibrium would exist at all with such weights.
It should be much simpler to find the optimum within this family, since it is just one-dimensional.
We assume the  density is continuous and has full support on [0, 1]×[0, ∞).
Simulations can also be used to quantify the effect of correlation on the location of the optimum.

We do this in Section 7. 
The setup is as follows.
