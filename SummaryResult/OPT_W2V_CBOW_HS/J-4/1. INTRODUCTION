For example, when a user searches the web for iPod, the highest paying advertisers (for example, Apple or Best Buy) for that keyword may appear in a separate sponsored section of the page above or to the right of the algorithmic results.
The general model of keyword auctions used here, where bidders are ranked according to a weight times their bid, was introduced by Aggarwal, Goel, and Motwani [1].
That paper also makes a connection between the revenue of keyword auctions in incomplete information settings with the revenue in symmetric equilibrium.
We then provide some theoretical insight into how tuning q can improve revenue, and why the correlation between bidders" values and click-through rates is relevant.
In Google"s case, value per impression is computed by multiplying the advertiser"s  (perclick) bid by the advertisement"s expected click-through rate, where this expectation may consider a number of  unspecified factors including historical click-through rate, position on the page, advertiser identity, user identity, and the  context of other items on the page.
We refer to these rules as rank-by-bid and rank-by-revenue, respectively.1 We analyze a family of ranking rules that contains the  Yahoo!
In Section 6 we consider the effect of q on advertiser satisfaction and user experience.
According to their simulations, rank-by-revenue always (weakly) dominates rank-by-bid in terms of revenue, whereas our results suggest that rank-by-bid may do much better for negative correlations.
Sponsored search is one of the fastest growing, most effective, and most profitable forms of advertising, generating roughly $7 billion in revenue in 2005 after nearly doubling every year for the previous five years.
ranked bidders in decreasing order of advertisers" stated values per click, while Google ranks in decreasing order of advertisers" stated values per impression.
By  convention, sponsored search advertisers generally bid and pay per click, meaning that they pay only when a user clicks on their ad, and do not pay if their ad is displayed but not clicked.
Iyengar and Kumar [5] study the optimal keyword auction design problem in a setting of incomplete information, and also make the connection to symmetric equilibrium.
We propose that search engines set thresholds of acceptable loss in advertiser satisfaction and user experience, then choose the revenue-optimal q  consistent with these constraints.
Advertisers bid for placement on the page in an  auctionstyle format where the larger their bid the more likely their listing will appear above other ads on the page.
In Section 2 we give a formal model of keyword auctions, and establish its equilibrium properties in Section 3.
They were the first to realize that the correlation between bidder values and click-through rates should be a key parameter affecting the revenue  performance of various ranking mechanisms.
Lahaie [8] gives an example that suggests rank-by-bid should yield more revenue when values and click-through rates are positively correlated, whereas rank-by-revenue should do better when the correlation is negative.
The work most closely related to ours is that of Feng, Bhargava, and Pennock [4].
50 ing rules where bidders are ranked in decreasing order of score eq b, where e denotes an advertiser"s click-through rate (normalized for position) and b his bid.
In  Section 4 we note that giving agents bidding credits can have the same effect as tuning the ranking rule explicitly.
The search engine evaluates the advertisers" bids and  allocates the positions on the page accordingly.
Both papers independently define an appealing refinement of Nash equilibrium for keyword auctions and analyze its equilibrium properties.
Microsoft"s MSN, previously an affiliate of Overture, now operates its own keyword auction marketplace.
In  Section 5 we give a general formulation of the optimal keyword auction design problem as an optimization problem, in a manner analogous to the single-item auction setting.
The key parameter is the correlation between advertiser value and click-through rate.
For simplicity, they assume bidders bid their true values, so their model is very different from ours and consequently so are their findings.
Generally, advertisements that appear in a higher position on the page garner more attention and more clicks from users.
We show through simulation that although q = 1 yields the efficient allocation, settings of q considerably less than 1 can yield superior revenue in equilibrium under certain conditions.
In this work we make a deeper study of this conjecture. 
Our premise is that bidders are playing a symmetric equilibrium, as defined by Edelman, Ostrovsky, and Schwarz [3] and Varian [11].
Notice that,  although bids are expressed as payments per click, the search engine cannot directly allocate clicks, but rather allocates impressions, or placements on the screen.
We also compare the  potential gains from tuning q with the gains from setting reserve prices, and find that the former may be much more  significant.
Clicks relate only stochastically to impressions.
We make use of this connection when formulating the optimal auction design problem in our setting.
Major search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and MSN sell advertisements by auctioning off space on keyword search results pages.
We consider  rank1 These are industry terms.
Thus, all else being equal, advertisers prefer higher positions to lower positions.
If this correlation is strongly positive, then smaller q are revenue-optimal.
keyword auctions.
Overture"s success prompted a number of  companies to adopt similar business models, most prominently Google, the leading web search engine today.
In Section 7 we describe our simulations and interpret their results.
The sponsored results are displayed in a format similar to algorithmic results: as a list of items each containing a title, a text description, and a hyperlink to a web page.
We will see, however, that  rankby-revenue is not necessarily revenue-optimal.
They called this refinement  locally envy-free equilibrium and symmetric equilibrium, respectively.
Varian also provides some empirical analysis.
