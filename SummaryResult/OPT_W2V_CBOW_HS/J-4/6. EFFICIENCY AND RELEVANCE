We would expect efficiency to be maximized at q = 1, since in this case a bidder"s weight is exactly his relevance.
After the swap, total relevance will have changed by the amount esxk−1 + etxk − etxk−1 − esxk = (es − et)(xk−1 − xk) > 0 As relevance strictly increases with each swap in the sort, total relevance is strictly greater when using q + rather than q.
Proposition 2 confirms that efficiency is indeed maximized at q = 1.
The revenue curve can then be plotted within the allowable range of q to find the revenue-optimal setting. 
Agents s and t, where s is initially ranked lower than t, are swapped in the process if and only if the following conditions hold: eq svs ≤ eq t vt eq+ s vs > eq+ t vt which together imply that es > et and hence es > et as > 0.
By Proposition 1, a lower bound on relevance will yield another lower bound on q.
Let ps = ws+1 ws bs+1 be the price per click faced by bidder s. The total value (efficiency) generated by the auction in equilibrium is V (q) = KX s=1 esxsvs = KX s=1 esxs(vs − ps) + KX s=1 esxsps.
Presumably users find the ad display more interesting and less of a nuisance if they are more inclined to click on the ads, so we adopt total relevance as a measure of user experience.
Perform an exchange sort to obtain the ranking that arises with q + starting from the ranking that arises with q (for a description of exchange sort and its properties, see Knuth [6] pp.
Total relevance is non-decreasing in q.
We would expect total relevance to increase with q, since more weight is placed on each bidder"s individual relevance.
By Proposition 2, a lower bound on efficiency will yield upper and lower bounds on the search space for q.
for any set of bidders), they also hold in  expectation.
The total relevance of the equilibrium allocation is L(q) = KX s=1 esxs, i.e.
Since we only  consider deviations from maximum efficiency that increase the auctioneer"s profits, any decrease in efficiency in our setting corresponds to a decrease in bidder profits.
The case for q ≤ 1 is similar.
As we see total value can be reinterpreted as total profits to the bidders and auctioneer combined.
Although tuning q can optimize current revenue, this may come at the price of future revenue because advertisers and users may be lost, seeing as their satisfaction decreases.
Recall that in symmetric equilibrium, bidders are ranked in order of decreasing wsvs.
Total value is non-decreasing in q for q ≤ 1 and non-increasing in q for q ≥ 1.
To guarantee future revenue will not be hurt too much, the auctioneer can impose bounds on the percent efficiency and relevance loss he is willing to tolerate, with q = 1 being a natural baseline.
If agents s and t are swapped, where s was initially ranked lower than t, then es > et.
So the assumption of full  support is violated, which is necessary for revenue equivalence.
Hence after swapping agents s and t, total value has not increased.
We therefore adopt efficiency as a measure of advertiser satisfaction.
In principle the revenue-optimal parameter q may lie  anywhere in (−∞, ∞).
This follows by the same reasoning as in the previous proof.
At some point in the sort, agent s occupies some slot α, β such that vs = αes + β.
Assume that is large enough to make the rankings distinct.
However, tuning the ranking rule also has consequences for advertiser satisfaction and user  experience, and taking these into account reduces the range of allowable q.
Since the trends described in Propositions 1 and 2 hold pointwise (i.e.
Perform an exchange sort to obtain the second ranking from the first as in the previous proof.
Recall that a density has full support over a given domain if every point in the domain has positive density.
This together with eq svs ≤ eq t vt implies that esvs ≤ etvt.
Now e1−q s ≤ e1−q t as 1 − q ≤ 0.
Let q ≥ 1 and let > 0.

These results motivate the following approach.
Let > 0.
