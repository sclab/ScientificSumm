We assume throughout that agents are numbered such that agent s obtains position s. An agent pays per click the lowest bid necessary to retain his position, so that the agent in slot s pays ws+1 ws bs+1.
If agent s bids bs, his corresponding score is wsbs.
There are K positions to be allocated among N bidders, where N > K. We assume that the (expected) click-through rate of bidder s in position t is of the form esxt, i.e.
A weight ws is associated with agent s, and agents bid for position.
Bidders have  quasilinear utility, so that the utility to bidder s of obtaining position t at a price of p per click is esxt(vs − p).
The auctioneer may introduce a reserve score of r, so that an agent"s ad appears only if his score is at least r. For agent s, this translates into a reserve price (minimum bid) of r/ws. 
Bidder s has value vs for each click.
> xK > 0 and let xt = 0 for t > K. We also refer to es as the relevance of bidder s. It is useful to interpret xt as the probability that an ad in position t will be noticed, and es as the probability that it will be clicked on if noticed.
Agents are ranked by score, so that the agent with highest score is ranked first, and so on.
separable into an advertiser effect es ∈ [0, 1] and position effect xt ∈ [0, 1].
We assume that x1 > x2 > .
