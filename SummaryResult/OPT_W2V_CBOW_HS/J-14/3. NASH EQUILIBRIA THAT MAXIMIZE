It is easy to check that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the vector (u, 1/2, f(u)) is a Nash equilibrium.
It  follows that to find a Nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff, we have to maximize Pk−1 i=1 Ti subject to conditions u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui) for i = 1, .
• The expected payoff to V−1 is 0 if it plays 0 and u0 − (x − x )u−1 −x if it plays 1, where u0 and u−1 are the strategies of U0 and U−1, respectively.
Finally, if v = 1/2, but w = f(u), player V is not indifferent between 0 and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2.
Second, we construct a graphical game whose Nash equilibria can be  parameterized by u ∈ [x , x ], so that at the equilibrium that corresponds to u the total payoff is R(u) and, moreover, some player"s  strategy is u.
The payoff to U−1 is 0, and the  expected payoff to each of the Ui, i = 0, .
To complete the proof, note that (x − x )u−1 + x ∈ [0, 1] for all u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0/(u0 + 1) ∈ [0, 1] for all u0 ∈ [0, 1], and 1/(2 − ui) ∈ [0, 1] for all ui ∈ [0, 1], so we have ui ∈ [0, 1] for all i = 0, .
, k − 1, we have vi = 1/2, and the strategies of the  players Ui and Ui+1 satisfy ui+1 = fi(ui), where f0(u) = u/(u + 1) and fi(u) = 1/(2 − u) for i > 0.
By Claim 2, the total payoff in any Nash equilibrium of this game is a function of u.
We conclude that the social welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium for this game is given by the vector of strategies (−2+√ 5, 1/2, (5 − √ 5)/5).
All Nash equilibria of the game G are of the form (u, 1/2, f(u)).
Using Claim 1, we select the payoffs to V so that P0 (V ) = −uw + 3w and P1 (V ) = P0 (V ) + w(u + 2) − (u + 1), where u and w are the (mixed) strategies of U and W , respectively.
Similarly, if v0 < 1/2, player U1 prefers to play 1, so we have u1 = 1.
, k − 1, the expected payoff to Vi when it plays 0 is P0 (Vi) = Aiuiui+1 − Aiui+1, and the  expected payoff to Vi when it plays 1 is P1 (Vi) = P0 (Vi) + ui+1(2 − ui) − 1, where Ai = −Ki+1 and ui+1 and ui are the strategies of Ui+1 and Ui, respectively.
Therefore, the Nash equilibrium with the maximum total payoff corresponds to the value of u that maximizes g(u) = −u (u + 1) u + 2 + 3 u + 1 u + 2 = − (u − 3)(u + 1) u + 2 .
The payoff to U is identically 0, i.e., P0 (U) = P1 (U) = 0.
The expected payoffs to V−1 and V0 are 0.
As 1 − x ≤ 1 − (x − x )u−1 − x ≤ 1 − x for u−1 ∈ [0, 1] and x < 1, we have P1 (V−1) > P0 (V−1), so V−1 prefers to play 1, a contradiction.
Therefore, to maximize the total payoff, we have to choose u ∈ [x , x ] so as to maximize K2 u + 2 + · · · + Kk u + k = R(u).
As x < x , x > 0, we have P1 (V−1) < P0 (V−1), so V−1 prefers to play 0, a contradiction.
For any degree-n algebraic number α ∈ [0, 1], there exists an integer payoff graphical game on a path of length O(n) such that, in all social welfare-maximizing Nash equilibria of this game, one of the players plays α.
Let x and x be some rational numbers in (α , α) and (α, α ), respectively; note that by excluding the endpoints of the intervals we ensure that x , x = 0, 1.
We have h(u) = (2u − 2)(u + 2) − (u − 3)(u + 1) (u + 2)2 = u2 + 4u − 1 (u + 2)2 .
, k − 1 we have Ti = Ai u + i − 1 u + i u + i u + i + 1 − Ai u + i u + i + 1 = −Ai 1 u + i + 1 = Ki+1 u + i + 1 .
Indeed, U is content to play 164 any mixed strategy u no matter what V and W do.
, K2n+2 ∈ Q and x , x ∈ (0, 1) ∩ Q such that α is the only maximum of R(x) = K2 x + 2 + · · · + K2n+2 x + 2n + 2 on [x , x ].
Then for Vi we have P1 (Vi) = P0 (Vi)−1, i.e., P1 (Vi) < P0 (Vi), which implies vi = 0, a contradiction.
Unfortunately, it turns out that computing such a strategy profile exactly is not possible: in this section, we show that even if all players" payoffs are integers, the strategy profile that maximizes the total payoff may have irrational coordinates; moreover, it may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrary degree.
The proof is by induction on i.
Let d = min{|αi − α| | αi ∈ A, αi = α}, and set α = max{α − d/2, 0}, α = min{α + d/2, 1}.
The respective total payoff is 0 − ( √ 5 − 5)( √ 5 − 1) √ 5 + 1 2 = 13/2 − 2 √ 5.
Moreover, for any value of u, the vector of strategies (u, 1/2, f(u)) constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
In particular, as long as vi−1 = 1/2, player Ui is indifferent between playing 0 and 1, so he can play any mixed strategy ui ∈ [0, 1].
Similarly, if v−1 > 1/2, the player U0 strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., u0 = 0, so we have P1 (V−1) = P0 (V−1) − (x − x )u−1 − x .
There exists an integer-payoff graphical game G on a 3-vertex path UV W such that, in any Nash equilibrium of G that maximizes social welfare, the strategy, u, of the player U and the total payoff, p, satisfy u, p ∈ R \ Q.
For i = 1, we have u1 = u/(u + 1).
Now, for i ≥ 2 suppose that ui−1 = (u + i − 2)/(u + i − 1).
, uk−1, 1/2, uk), where u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x − x )u−1 + x , u1 = u0/(u0 + 1), and ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui) for i ≥ 1 constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
Similarly, if vi < 1/2, player Ui+1 prefers to play 1, so we have ui+1 = 1.
We have g(u) < 0 for g > 3, g(u) > 0 for u < −2, so the extremum of g(u) that lies between 1 and 3, i.e., u = −2 + √ 5, is a local maximum.
Hence, in all Nash equilibria of this game we have u0 ∈ [x , x ].
It  follows that in the payoff-maximizing Nash equilibrium of our game U0 plays α.
Also, note that f(0) = x , f(1) = x , and, moreover, f(u−1) ∈ [x , x ] if and only if u−1 ∈ [0, 1].
We have ui = 1/(2 − ui−1) = (u + i − 1)/(2u + 2i − 2 − u − i + 2) = (u + i − 1)/(u + i).
Any strategy profile of the form (u−1, 1/2, u0, 1/2, u1, 1/2, .
Hence, P1 (V ) = P0 (V ) + (u + 2) − (u + 1), i.e., P1 (V ) > P0 (V ), which implies v = 1, a contradiction.
As R(x) is a proper rational expression and all roots of its  denominator are simple, by partial fraction decomposition theorem, R(x) can be represented as R(x) = K2 x + 2 + · · · + K2n+2 x + 2n + 2 , where K2, .
3.1 Warm-up: quadratic irrationalities We start by providing an example of a graphical game on a path of length 3 with integer payoffs such that in the Nash equilibrium that maximizes the total payoff, one of the players has a strategy in R \ Q.
First, we construct a rational expression R(x) and a segment [x , x ] such that x , x ∈ Q and α is the only maximum of R(x) on [x , x ].
By inductive hypothesis, we have ui < 1.
Clearly, the player V−1 is indifferent between playing 0 and 1 if and only if u0 = f(u−1).
As long as u0 = (x −x )u−1 +x , player V−1 is indifferent between 0 and 1, so he is content to play 1/2; a similar argument applies to players V0, .
Then U0 strictly prefers to play 1, i.e., u0 = 1, so we have P1 (V−1) = P0 (V−1) + 1 − (x − x )u−1 − x .
First, suppose that vi > 1/2.
• The expected payoff to V0 is 0 if it plays 0 and u1(u0 + 1)− u0 if it plays 1, where u0 and u1 are the strategies of U0 and U1, respectively.
Observe that as u−1 varies from 0 to 1, u varies from x to x .
Then Ui+1 strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., ui+1 = 0.
Then U1 strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., u1 = 0.
, k − 1, the expected payoff to Vi is Ti = Aiuiui+1 − Aiui+1.
Hence, h(u) = 0 if and only if u ∈ {−2 + √ 5, −2 − √ 5}.
We use induction on i to prove that the statement of the claim is true and, additionally, ui = 1 for i > 0.
Then for V we have P1 (V ) = P0 (V ) − (u + 1), i.e., P1 (V ) < P0 (V ), which implies v = 0, a contradiction.
3.2 Strategies of arbitrary degree We have shown that in the social welfare-maximizing Nash  equilibrium, some players" strategies can be quadratic irrationalities, and so can the total payoff.
As [x , x ] ⊂ [α , α ], we have that α is the only maximum of R(x) on [x , x ].
Furthermore, V is indifferent between 0 and 1 as long as w = f(u), so it can play 1/2.
For the base case i = 0, note that u0 = 0 by the previous claim (recall that x , x are selected so that x , x = 0, 1) and consider the triple (U0, V0, U1).
Finally, if vi = 1/2, but ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui), player Vi is not indifferent between 0 and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2.
The payoff to W is 0 if it selects the same action as V and 1 otherwise.
Intuitively, we want each triple (Ui−1, Vi−1, Ui) to behave similarly to the players U, V , and W from the game described in the previous subsection.
It follows that for i = 1, .
The proof is similar to that of Claim 2.
Observe that R(x) ≤ 0 for all x ∈ [0, 1] and R(x) = 0 if and only if Q1(x) = 0.
By construction, the only maximum of R(u) on [x , x ] is α.
Moreover, as ui+1 = 1/(2 − ui) and ui < 1, we have ui+1 < 1.
Moreover, as u1 = u0/(u0 + 1) and u0 ∈ [0, 1], we have u1 = 1.
More specifically, the payoff to U is 0, the payoff to V is −uf(u) + 3f(u), and the payoff to W is 1/2.
In all Nash equilibria of this game V−1 plays 1/2, and the strategies of u−1 and u0 satisfy u0 = (x − x )u−1 + x .
Finally, if v0 = 1/2, but u1 = u0/(u0 + 1), player V0 is not indifferent between 0 and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2.
THE SOCIAL WELFARE: SOLUTIONS IN R \ Q From the point of view of social welfare, the best Nash  equilibrium is the one that maximizes the sum of the players" expected payoffs.
, k, the payoffs of player Ui only depend on the strategy of player Vi−1.
In all Nash equilibria of this game for each i = 0, .
Consequently, in all Nash equilibria we have u0 ∈ [x , x ].
Namely, suppose that the statement is proved for all i < i and consider the triple (Ui, Vi, Ui+1).
Finally, if V plays 0 and 1 with equal probability, W is indifferent between 0 and 1, so it can play f(u).
As u0 = 0, we have P1 (V0) < P0 (V0), which implies v1 = 0, a contradiction.
Finally, if V−1 plays 1/2, but u0 = f(u−1), player V−1 is not indifferent between 0 and 1, so he would deviate from playing 1/2.
Let f(u−1) = (x − x )u−1 + x .
CLAIM 2.
It follows that V is indifferent between playing 0 and 1 if and only if w = f(u) = u+1 u+2 .
Consequently, P1 (Vi) > P0 (Vi), which implies vi = 1, a contradiction.
, k, the payoff to Ui does not depend on Vi and is 1 if Ui and Vi−1 select different actions and 0 otherwise.
It follows that P1 (V0) > P0 (V0), which implies v0 = 1, a contradiction.
, k, is 1/2.
Hence, the set A is also the set of all maxima of R(x) on [0, 1].
, k. Now, let us compute the total payoff under a strategy profile of the form given in Claim 5.
In this subsection, we will extend this result to show that we can construct an integer-payoff graphical game on a path whose social welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium involves arbitrary algebraic numbers in [0, 1].
Observe that for any u ∈ [0, 1] we have f(u) ∈ [0, 1].
It follows that to achieve the payoff-maximizing Nash equilibrium, this player has to play α.
The proof of this claim is also similar to that of Claim 2.
First, suppose that v0 > 1/2.
It has the same roots as P(x), and moreover, for any x ∈ A we have Q1(x) < 0.
Hence, P1 (Vi) = P0 (Vi) + 1 − ui.
First, the player U−1"s payoffs do not depend on other players" actions, so he is free to play any strategy in [0, 1].
Then for V0 we have P1 (V0) = P0 (V0) − u0.
Similarly, if v < 1/2, player W prefers to play 1, so we have w = 1.
The payoffs to the players in G are specified as follows.
Finally, for any i = 1, .
That is, in any Nash equilibrium, V plays v = 1/2 and W plays w = f(u).
LEMMA 1.
The function g(u) changes sign at −2, −1, and 3.
• The payoff to U−1 is 0 no matter what everyone else does.
Suppose that v−1 < 1/2.
To find extrema of g(u), we compute h(u) = − d du g(u).
THEOREM 1.
Let v0 be the strategy of V0.
Then W strictly prefers to play 0, i.e., w = 0.
Clearly, α is the only zero (and hence, the only maximum) of R(x) on [α , α ].
Conversely, suppose that v > 1/2.
More precisely, we define the payoffs to the players in the following way.
Let P(x) be the minimal polynomial of α, i.e., a  polynomial of degree n with rational coefficients whose leading  coefficient is 1 such that P(α) = 0.
For i = 1, .
Consider a graphical game on the path U−1V−1U0V0U1V1 .
Given an algebraic number α ∈ [0, 1], deg(α) = n, there exist K2, .
Note that −2 + √ 5 ∈ [0, 1].
LEMMA 2.
However, it is easy to see that we can multiply all payoffs to a player by their greatest common denominator without affecting his strategy.
Finally, for each i = 0, .
Finally, note that the payoffs in our game are rational rather than integer.
This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.
To  simplify notation, set u = u0.
This completes the proof of Claim 2.
Let vi be the strategy of Vi.
We will now characterize the Nash equilibria of this game using a sequence of claims.
Hence, A is the set of all maxima of Q1(x).
THEOREM 2.
• For each i = 0, .
CLAIM 3.
In the next subsection, we will extend this example to  algebraic numbers of arbitrary degree n; to do so, we have to consider paths of length O(n).
In the resulting game, all payoffs are integer.
This concludes the proof of Theorem 2. 
Now, set R(x) = Q1(x) (x+2)...(x+2n+1)(x+2n+2) .
, k, we have ui = u+i−1 u+i .
, k − 1.
The argument for the inductive step is similar.
Hence, P1 (V0) = P0 (V0) + 1.
• For each i = 1, .

Consider the polynomial Q1(x) = −P2 (x).
