For any set A ⊆ [0, 1]2 that is represented as a union of a finite number of rectangles, we say that a point u ∈ [0, 1] on the U-axis is a  Uevent point of A if u = 0 or u = 1 or the representation of A contains a rectangle of the form IV × IU and u is an endpoint of IU ; V -event points are defined similarly.
When a node V is instructed by its parent to adopt mixed strategy v, it does the  following for each child U - It finds a pair (v, u) ∈ B(V, U) (with the same v value that it was given by its parent) and instructs U to play u.
A mixed strategy of a player V is represented as a single number v ∈ [0, 1], which denotes the probability that V selects action 1.
Given an edge (V, W ) of the tree G, and a mixed strategy w for W , let G(V,W ),W =w be the instance obtained from G by (1) deleting all nodes Z which are separated from V by W (i.e., all nodes Z such that the path from Z to V passes through W ), and (2) restricting the instance so that W is required to play mixed  strategy w. Definition 1.
Each vertex has two actions, which are denoted by 0 and 1.
The proof that the number of rectangles in B(Vj+1, Vj) is polynomial proceeds by first showing that the number of event points in B(Vj+1, Vj ) cannot exceed the number of event points in B(Vj, Vj−1) by more than 2, and using this fact to bound the number of rectangles in B(Vj+1, Vj ).
For a vertex V with a single child U and parent W , given any A, B, C, D ∈ Q, A , B , C , D ∈ Q, one can select the payoffs to V so that P0 (V ) = Auw + Bu + Cw + D, P1 (V ) = A uw + B u + C w + D .
The best response policy for a vertex U given its parent V can be represented as a union of rectangles, where a rectangle is defined by a pair of closed intervals (IV , IU ) and consists of all points in IV × IU ; it may be the case that one or both of the intervals IV and IU consists of a single point.
We consider graphical games in which the underlying graph G is an n-vertex tree, in which each vertex has at most Δ children.
Suppose that (V, W ) is an edge of the tree, that v is a mixed strategy for V and that w is a mixed strategy for W .
We say that v is a potential best response to w (denoted by v ∈ pbrV (w)) if there is an equilibrium in the instance G(V,W ),W =w in which V has mixed strategy v. We define the best response policy for V , given W , as B(W, V ) = {(w, v) | v ∈ pbrV (w), w ∈ [0, 1]}.
The root selects a mixed strategy w for the root W and a mixed strategy v ∈ B(W, V ) for each child V of W .
In order to perform computations on B(V, U), and to bound the number of rectangles, [9] used the notion of an event point, which is defined as follows.
The upstream pass of the generic algorithm of [13] considers  every node V (other than the root) and computes the best response policy for V given its parent.
Let P0 (V ) and P1 (V ) be the expected payoffs to V when it plays 0 and 1, respectively.
For many games considered in this paper, the underlying graph is an n-vertex path, i.e., a graph G = (V, E) with V = {V1, .
We have to select the values of Pij so that P00 − P10 − P01 + P11 = A, −P00 + P10 = B, −P00 + P01 = C, P00 = D. It is easy to see that the unique solution is given by P00 = D, P01 = C + D, P10 = B + D, P11 = A + B + C + D. The input to all algorithms considered in this paper includes the payoff matrices for each player.
Both P0 (V ) and P1 (V ) are multilinear functions of the strategies of V "s neighbors.
Moreover, if all A, B, C, D, A , B , C , D are integer, the payoffs to V are integer as well.
For convenience, we assume without loss of generality that the root has a single child, and that its payoff is independent of the action chosen by the child.
For i, j = 0, 1, let Pij be the payoff to V when U plays i, V plays 0 and W plays j.
This can be achieved by first choosing an arbitrary root of the tree, and then adding a dummy parent of this root, giving the new parent a constant payoff function, e.g., 0.
It instructs each child V to play v. The  remainder of the downward pass is recursive.
We will give the proof for P0 (V ); the proof for P1 (V ) is similar.
We assume that all elements of these matrices are integer.
We have P0 (V ) = P00(1 − u)(1 − w) + P10u(1 − w) + P01(1 − u)w + P11uw.
For the purposes of the algorithm, the tree is rooted arbitrarily.
In [9], it was shown that for such games, the best response policy has only polynomially-many rectangles.
Let Pmax be the greatest absolute value of any element of any payoff matrix.
With the above assumptions about the root, the downstream pass is straightforward.
Then the input consists of at most n2Δ+1 numbers, each of which can be represented using log Pmax bits.
