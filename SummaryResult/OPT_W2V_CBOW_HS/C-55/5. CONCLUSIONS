Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.
We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.
To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and  proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.
This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.
It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g.
First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.
An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.
A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 
by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.
