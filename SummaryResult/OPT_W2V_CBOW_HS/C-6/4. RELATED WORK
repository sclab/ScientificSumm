Several authors have addressed the problem of the management of content in distributed networks.
After carefully considering the required functionality to implement content management in the networked environment, we have partitioned the system into three simple functions, namely Content manager, Policy manager and Storage manager.
Unlike the Spectrum architecture which allows edge devices to operate in a largely autonomous fashion, the  vendor solutions typically are more tightly coupled to a centralized controller and do not have the sophisticated time-based operations offered by Spectrum. 
The authors construct a system employing various components, such as a Central Router, Cache Knowledge base, Subcaches, and a Subcache eviction judge.
In the case where Spectrum is used in a PVR  configuration this type of system would perform a higher level function and could clearly benefit from the functionalities of the Spectrum architecture.
For example in [5], the problem of serving multimedia content via distributed servers is  considered.
Much of the work focuses on the policy management aspect.
Cisco and Netapp) have developed and implemented content management products and tools.
This has allowed us to easily implement and experiment with a prototype system.
Our work differs in that we are considering more than the policy management aspects of the problem.
Content is distributed among server resources in proportion to user demand using a Demand Dissemination Protocol.
Other related work involves so called TV recommendation  systems which are used in PVRs to automatically select content for users, e.g.
The Cache Knowledge base allows sophisticated policies to be  employed.
In [1] content is distributed among sub-caches.
The  performance of the scheme is benchmarked via simulation.
Simulation is used to compare the proposed scheme with well-known replacement algorithms.
Finally, in the commercial CDN environment vendors (e.g.
