Further, in this new situation, the contents of the ad becomes useful to rank the most relevant ads making AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) the best among all described methods.
Finally, we analyze the impact on the ranking of using the contents of pages pointed by the ads.
For each of our 100 triggering pages, we selected the top three ranked ads provided by each of our 10 ad placement strategies.
As we observe in Figure 4, for the AD strategy, the best ranking is obtained by the use of campaign idf, that is, by calculating our idf factor so that it discriminates campaigns.
In our ad collection, idf factors can be computed by taking ads, advertisers or campaigns as documents.
This happens because the two additional sources of evidence, expansion terms and pages pointed by the ads, are distinct and complementary, providing extra and  valuable information for matching ads to a Web page.
The gain is even larger when we use the terms in r to expand the triggering page (AAK EXP method).
We also present actual hits per advertisement slot and gains in  average precision relative to our baseline, AAK.
To quantify the precision of our results, we used 11-point average figures [2].
AAK (ads and keywords) is superior.
It may contain messages that do not properly describe the ad topics such as requisitions for user actions (e.g, visit our site) and general sentences that could be applied to any product or service (e.g, we delivery for the whole  country).

They show that matching the ads to the terms in the set r instead of to the triggering page p (AAK T strategy) leads to a considerable improvement over our baseline, AAK.
Since we are not able to evaluate the entire ad collection, recall values are relative to the set of evaluated advertisements.
Since we are initially interested in the placement of  advertisements in the pages of information portals, our test  collection was composed of 100 pages extracted from a  Brazilian newspaper.
Then, the inverse document frequency of ti is given by: idfi = log 100 9 Hence, we can compute ad, advertiser or campaign idf  factors.
These are our triggering pages.
The p column includes the top terms for this page ranked according to our tf-idf  weighting scheme.
Further, the data needed by our strategies (page crawling, page expansion, and ad link crawling) can be gathered and processed oﬄine, not affecting the user experience.
The average number of relevant advertisements per page pool was 5.15.
Columns labelled #1, #2, and #3 indicate total of hits in first, second, and third advertisement slots,  respectively.
However, combining evidence from the pages pointed by the ads with our baseline yields improved results.
We call hit an assignment of an ad (to the triggering page) that was considered relevant by the evaluators.
To exemplify, consider the computation of ad idf for a term ti that occurs 9 times in a collection of 100 ads.
4.1 Methodology To evaluate our ad placement strategies, we performed a series of experiments using a sample of a real case ad collection with 93,972 advertisements, 1,744 advertisers, and 68,238 keywords2 .
As a consequence, the KW strategy is superior to the AD and AD KW strategies.
We notice that our AAK strategy provides a gain in average precision of 60% relative to the trivial AD strategy.
We notice that the highest number of hits in the first slot was generated by the method AAK EXP.

This situation changes when we require the keywords to appear in the target Web page.
As shown, directly matching the  contents of the ad to the triggering page (AD strategy) is not so effective.
500 4.3 Results Matching Strategies Figure 5 displays the results for the matching strategies  presented in Section 2.
This effect can be accomplished by calculating the factor relative to idf advertisers or campaigns instead of ads.
In fact,  campaign idf factors yielded the best results.
Figure 6 illustrates our results when the set r of  expansion terms is used.
Thus, for each triggering page we select no more than 30 ads.
It is clear that using only the contents of the pages pointed by the ads (H strategy) yields very poor results.
However, the method with best  overall retrieval performance was AAK EXP H, yielding a gain in average precision figures of roughly 50% over the baseline (AAK).
Thus, they will be used in all the experiments reported from now on.

Notice that we adopted the same pooling method used to evaluate the TREC Web-based collection [6].
The advertisements are grouped in 2,029 campaigns with an average of 1.16 campaigns per advertiser.
4.4 Performance Issues In a keyword targeted advertising system, ads are assigned at query time, thus the performance of the system is a very important issue.
Impedance Coupling Strategies Table 2 shows top ranked terms that occur in a page  covering Argentinean wines produced using grapes derived from the Bordeaux region of France.
Similar results were obtained for all the other methods.
On the other hand, an advertiser provided keyword summarizes well the topic of the ad.
4.2 Tuning Idf factors We start by analyzing the impact of different idf factors in our advertisement collection.
For this reason, we adopt AAK as our baseline in the next set of experiments.
Figure 7 displays our results.
Also, if a new ad comes in we might consider assigning this ad to already published pages in oﬄine mode.
The AAK strategy provides improvements of 60% relative to the AD strategy.
These top ads were then inserted in a pool for that triggering page.
Ranking scores were normalized in order to sum up to 1.
Idf factors are important because they quantify how discriminative is a term in the collection.
In content-targeted advertising systems, we can associate ads with a page at publishing (or  updating) time.
By filtering out ads whose keywords do not occur in the triggering page, much noise is discarded.
In Figure 8 we show precision-recall curves and in Table 3 we show 11-point average figures.
We also present actual hits per advertisement slot.
The r column includes the top ranked  expansion terms generated according to Eq.

are published and the rate that ads are added or modified.
Most  important, combining our best strategy so far (AAK EXP) with pages pointed by ads (AAK EXP H strategy) leads to superior results.
The reason is that the ad contents are very noisy.
Figure 8 and Table 3 summarize all results described in this section.
This confirms our hypothesis that the triggering page could have some interesting terms that should not be completely discarded.
This reflects the fact that terms might be better  discriminators for a business topic than for an specific ad.
Each pool contained an average of 15.81 advertisements.
For the strategies AAK T and AAK EXP, we had to  generate a set of expansion terms.
Terms marked with ‘*" are not shared by the sets p and r. whites, but also reveal new terms related to the main topic of the page such as aroma and red.
All advertisements in each pool were submitted to a manual evaluation by a group of 15 users.
As we have no preferences for particular 2 Data in portuguese provided by an on-line advertisement company that operates in Brazil.
For the strategies H, AAK H, and AAK EXP H, we also crawled the pages pointed to by the advertisers.
This database is composed of 5,939,061 pages of the Brazilian Web, under the domain .br.
Table 1 illustrates average precision figures for Figure 5.
They were crawled in such a way that only the contents of their  articles was preserved.
Further, they avoid some uninteresting terms such as obtained and country.
No other filtering method was applied to these pages besides the  removal of HTML tags.
For that, we used a database of Web pages crawled by the TodoBR search engine [12] (http://www.todobr.com.br/).
Thus, from this point of view, the performance is not critical and will not be addressed in this work. 
This shows that careful consideration of the evidence related to the problem does pay off.
This makes ANDKW a better alternative than KW.
