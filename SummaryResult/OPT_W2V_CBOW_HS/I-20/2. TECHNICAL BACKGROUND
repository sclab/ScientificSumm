A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.
A coalitional game is composed of a set of n agents, I, and a function mapping any subset (coalition) of the agents to a real value v : 2I → R. In a simple coalitional game, v only gets values of 0 or 1 (v : 2I → {0, 1}).
One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index.
An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agent"s removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \ {i}) = 0.
2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.
Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and  different definitions of having a significant role, have caused  researchers to define different power indices, one of the most  prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].
The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \ {i})].
Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].
However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.
We denote the set of all winning coalitions as W(v) = {C ⊂ 2I |v(C) = 1}.
The Banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 
We say a coalition C ⊂ I wins if v(C) = 1, and say it loses if v(C) = 0.
This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.
