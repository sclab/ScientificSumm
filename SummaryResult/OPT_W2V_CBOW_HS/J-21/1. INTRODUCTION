We also illustrate another application to analyzing how a market maker can improve the prediction accuracy of a market in which traders will not trade unless their  expected profit is above a threshold.
Lastly, we illustrate how the projection game model can be used to analyze the potential for manipulation of  information markets for long-term gain.2 We present an example scenario in which such manipulation can occur, and suggest additional rules that might mitigate the possibility of  manipulation.
We use the equivalence between the DPM and the projection game to prove that the DPM is arbitrage-free, deduce profitable strategies in the DPM, and demonstrate that constraints on the agents" trades are necessary to  prevent a strategic breakdown.
The DPM was created as a combination of a pari-mutuel market (which is commonly used for betting on horses) and a continuous double auction, in order to simultaneously obtain the first one"s infinite buy-in liquidity and the latter"s  ability to react continuously to new information.
We note that while the MSR with the spherical scoring rule somewhat resembles the projection game, due to the mathematical similarity of their profit expressions, the DPM model is markedly different and thus its equivalence to the projection game is especially striking.
For the DPM, we are not aware of any prior strategic analysis of this nature; in fact, a strategic hole was discovered while testing the DPM in the Yahoo!
Two designs for information markets have been proposed: the Dynamic Parimutuel Market (DPM) by Pennock [10] and the Market Scoring Rules (MSR) by Hanson [6].
This is not an easy task,  because markets are complex, and traders can influence each other"s beliefs through their trades, and hence, can  potentially achieve long term gains by manipulating the market.
This allows us to use the projection game as a conceptual model for market scoring rules.
The foundations of the MSR lie in the idea of a proper scoring rule, which is a technique to reward forecasters in a way that encourages them to give their best prediction.
In Section 3, we study the dynamic parimutuel market, and show that trade in a DPM is equivalent to a projection game.
A number of recent studies have addressed the design of the market structure and trading rules for information  markets, as well as the incentive to participate and other  strategic issues.
Thus, in a situation in which future events are uncertain, and each trader might have a little information, the aggregated  information contained in the market prices can be used to predict future events.
Information markets can be modeled as a game in which the participants bet on a number of possible outcomes, such as the results of a presidential election, by buying shares of the outcomes and receiving payoffs when the outcome is realized.
This has motivated the creation of information markets, which are mechanisms for aggregating the traders" information about an uncertain event.
1.1 Our Results In this paper, we seek to develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information  markets.
We present an analysis of the optimal strategies and profits in this game.
Further, if we assume that the traders beliefs at the end of trading match the true probability of the event being predicted, the traders" payoffs and profits in the DPM are identical to their payoffs and profits in a corresponding  projection game.
For the MSR, it has been shown that, if we exclude the  possibility of achieving gain through misleading other traders, it is optimal for each trader to honestly reflect her private belief in her trades.
Both the DPM and the MSR were designed with the goal of giving informed traders an incentive to trade, and to reveal their information as soon as possible, while also controlling the subsidy that the market designer needs to pump into the market.
We then undertake an analysis of traders" costs and  profits in the dynamic parimutuel market.
It has long been observed that, because the market price is influenced by all the trades taking place, it aggregates the private information of all the traders.
Recently, researchers have turned to the problem of  designing market structures specifically to achieve better  information aggregation properties than traditional markets.
In Section 5, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze non-myopic, and potentially manipulative, actions.
In particular, the profitability of any move under the spherical scoring rule is exactly proportional to the profitability of the corresponding move in the projection game restricted to a circle, with slight distortion of the prior probabilities.
In this way, the players" behavior transmits their personal  information and beliefs about the possible outcomes, and can be used to predict the event more accurately.
316 The innovation in the MSR is to use these scoring rules as instruments that can be traded, thus providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade.
Further, because the restricted projection game corresponds to a DPM with a natural trading constraint, this sheds light on an intriguing connection between the MSR and the DPM.
As a side effect of trade, the participants in a market reveal something about their preferences and beliefs.
1.2 Related Work Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that  market prices are good predictors of future events, and seem to aggregate the collected wisdom of all the traders [2, 3, 12, 1, 5, 16].
Buzz market [8] to experimentally test the market"s prediction  properties.
Information markets rely on informed traders trading for their own profit, so it is critical to understand the strategic properties of these markets.
Remarkably, we find that the cost of a sequence of trades in the DPM is  identical to the cost of the corresponding moves in the projection game.
The projection game is  conceptually simpler than the MSR and DPM, and thus it is easier to analyze.
As in financial markets, the participants aim to maximize their profit by buying low and selling high.
Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection 1 game, that serves as a useful model for information markets.
However, strategic issues in information markets have also been  studied by Mangold et al.
The benefit of well-designed information markets goes beyond information aggregation; they can also be used as a hedging instrument, to allow traders to insure against risk.
Markets have long been used as a medium for trade.
This effect has also been demonstrated in laboratory studies [13, 14], and has theoretical support in the literature of rational expectations [9].
We also prove an equivalence between the projection game and the MSR: We show that play in the MSR is strategically equivalent to play in a restricted projection game, at least for myopic strategies and small trades.
In addition it has an attractive geometric  visualization, which makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent.
For example, in a financial market, agents would buy shares which they think are undervalued, and sell shares which they think are overvalued.
Organization of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the  projection game, and analyze the players" costs, profits, and  optimal strategies in this game.
The MSR was to be used in a policy analysis market in the Middle East [15], which was subsequently withdrawn.
An upcoming survey paper [11] discusses  costfunction formulations of automated market makers.
We establish a  connection between the projection game and the MSR in Section 4.
The two papers most closely related to our work are the papers by Hanson [6] and Pennock [10].

We present our conclusions, and suggestions for future work, in Section 6.
