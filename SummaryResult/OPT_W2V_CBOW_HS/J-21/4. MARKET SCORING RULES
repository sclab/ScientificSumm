Then,  expanding the spherical scoring functions sA, sB, the player"s profit for a move from r to r can be rewritten in terms of the corresponding coordinates x, x as: SSR-PROFIT([x, x ]) = p · (x − x) For any collection X of moves, the total payoff in the SSR market is given by: SSR-PROFITp(X ) = X [x,x ]∈X p · [x − x] = p · 2 4 X [x,x ]∈X [x − x] 3 5 Finally, we note that p and q are related by q = μpp, where μp = 1/ p p2 + (1 − p)2 is a scalar that depends only on p. This immediately gives us the following strong  strategic equivalence for the restricted projection game and the SSR market: Theorem 7.
Consider the projection game restricted to the non-negative unit circle where strategies x have the  natural one-to-one correspondence to probability distributions r = (r, 1 − r) given by x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ).
Any collection of moves X yields a  positive (negative) payoff in the restricted projection game iff X yields a positive (negative) payoff in the Spherical Scoring Rule market.
Consider the restricted projection game with some prior probability distribution F over possible values of p. Then, there is a probability distribution G with the same support as F, and a strictly positive constant c that depends only on F such that: • (i) For any collection X of moves, the expected profits are related by: EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) • (ii) For any collection X , and any measurable  information set I ⊆ [0, 1], the expected profits conditioned on knowing that p ∈ I satisfy EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )|p ∈ I) = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )|p ∈ I) The converse also holds: For any probability distribution G, there is a distribution F such that both these statements are true.
Although stated for  logscoring rules, the theorem holds for any scoring rules that induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum at p, such as the quadratic scoring rule and others. 
The potential for any x = ( r |r| , 1−r |r| ) is given by φ(x(r), p) = |x| − q · x(r), It is easy to show that d dr φ(x(r), p) < 0 for r < p and the derivative is positive for r > p, so the potential function along the circle is decreasing and then increasing with r similarly to an energy function, with a global minimum at r = p, as desired.
Theorem 10 establishes that the market log-scoring rule is strategically similar to the projection game played on a circle, in the sense that the optimal direction of movement at the current state is the same in both games.
However, it is possible to extend the transformation to projection games in which the radius ri after the ith move is a fixed function of i (not necessarily constant), so that it is not within the strategic control of the player making the move; such games can also be strategically implemented via the spherical scoring rule (with distortion of priors).
We can extend the correspondence to settings with uncertain p, as follows: Theorem 9.
We can define a collection of moves X = X − X by adding the inverse of X to X .
SEG-PROFITp(X ) = X [x,x ]∈X q · [x − x] = q · 2 4 X [x,x ]∈X [x − x] 3 5 Spherical scoring rule profit We now turn our  attention to the MSR with the spherical scoring rule (SSR).
Define the density function g of distribution G by g(p) = μpf(p) c Now, for a collection of moves X , EF (SEG-PROFIT(X )) = Z SEG-PROFITp(X )f(p)dp = Z SSR-PROFITp(X )μpf(p)dp = Z SSR-PROFITp(X )cg(p)dp = cEG(SSR-PROFIT(X )) 322 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x y log scoring rule quadratic scoring rule Figure 3: Sample score curves for the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri and the quadratic scoring rule si(r) = ai + b(2ri − P k r2 k).
For two events, this can be written as: sA(rA, rB) = rA p r2 A + r2 B ; sB(rA, rB) = rB p r2 A + r2 B The spherical scoring rule is known to be a proper scoring rule.
For the log scoring rule si(r) = ai + b log ri with b > 0, d dr φMSR(s(r), p) = −p · b r , − b 1 − r  = −b p r − 1 − p 1 − r  = b r − p r(1 − r) .
Implementation in expectation Another important consequence of Theorem 9 is that the restricted projection game can be implemented with a small distortion in the probability distribution over values of p, by using a Spherical Scoring Rule to implement the payoffs.
Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, φMSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)].
Let x = (x, y) denote a position in the projection game.
We will show that the profit  potentials in the two games have analogous roles for analyzing the optimal strategies, in particular both potential functions have a global minimum 0 at r = p. Theorem 10.
The converse follows similarly by constructing F from G. Analysis of MSR strategies Theorem 9 provides the foundation for analysis of strategies in scoring rule markets.
As derived above, SEG-PROFITp(X ) = μpSSR-PROFITp(X ).
The scoring rule is specified by functions sA(rA, rB) and sB(rA, rB), which are applied as follows: If the event A occurs, the forecaster is paid sA(rA, rB), and if the event B occurs, the forecaster is paid sB(rA, rB).
We prove an infinitesimal similarity between the restricted  projection game and the MSR with log scoring rule; the result generalizes to all proper scoring rules that have a unique local and global maximum.
Trade in a log market scoring rule is strategically similar to trade in the projection game on the quarter-circle, in that d dr φ(s(r), p) < 0 for r < p d dr φ(s(r), p) > 0 for r > p, both for the projection game and MSR potentials φ(.).
Although theorem 7 is stated in terms of the sign of the payoff, it extends to relative payoffs of two collections of moves: Corollary 8.
Then, the projection game profit of a move [x, x ] is q · [x − x] (noting that |x| = |x |).
Consider any two collections of moves X , X .
The key property that a proper scoring rule satisfies is that the expected payment is maximized when the report is identical to the true probability distribution.
In this section, we show that, when the scoring rule used is the spherical scoring rule [4], there is a strong strategic  equivalence between the projection game and the market scoring rule.
It follows that the ex post optimality of a move (or set of moves) is the same in both the projection game and the SSR market.
Then, X yields a greater payoff than X in the projection game iff X yields a greater payment than X in the SSR market.
Then, if the true probability of A is p, her expected profit is SSR-PROFIT([r, r ]) = p(sA(r )−sA(r))+(1−p)(sB(r )−sB(r)) Now, let us represent the initial and final position in terms of circular coordinates.
Note that the coordinates satisfy |x| = 1, and thus correspond to valid coordinates for the restricted projection game.
In both the projection game and the SSR, the inverse move profit is simply the negative profit of the move (the moves are reversible).
We now demonstrate a close connection between the  projection game restricted to a circular arc and a market scoring rule that uses the spherical scoring rule.
For example, if the current state is r < p, it is profitable to move to r+dr since the effective profit of that move is profit(r, r ) = φ(s(r), p) − φ(s(r + dr), p) > 0.
In the simple setting of two exhaustive, mutually exclusive events A and B, proper scoring rules are defined as follows.
Now, consider the projection game on the non-negative unit circle.
Every move [x, x ] has a corresponding inverse move [x , x].
To the extent that strategies in these markets are  independent of the specific scoring rule used, we can use the  spherical scoring rule as the market instrument.
Since r = (r, 1 − r) is a probability distribution, this  expression is positive for r > p and negative for r < p as desired.
Consider a player who changes the report from r to r .
Then, analysis of strategies in the projection game with a slightly distorted distribution over p can be used to understand the strategic properties of the original market situation.
Note that SEG-PROFITp(X ) = SEG-PROFITp(X )−SEG-PROFITp(X ) and SSR-PROFITp(X ) = SSR-PROFITp(X )−SSR-PROFITp(X ); applying theorem 7 completes the proof.
Restricted projection game Consider a move in this restricted projection game from x to x .
4.2 Connection to other scoring rules In this section, we show a weaker similarity between the projection game and the MSR with other scoring rules.
It is based on the concept of a proper scoring rule, a technique which rewards forecasters to give their best  prediction.
We consider the projection game restricted to the circle |x| = 1.
Unfortunately, the result does not extend to unrestricted projection games,  because the relative profit of moving along the circle versus changing radius is not preserved through this  transformation.
A geometric visualization of some common scoring rules in two dimensions is depicted in Figure 3.
Recall that q = ( p √ p2+(1−p)2 , 1−p √ p2+(1−p)2 ), where p is the true probability of the event.
4.1 Equivalence with Spherical Scoring Rule In this section, we focus on one specific scoring rule: the spherical scoring rule [4].
(sketch) The derivative of the MSR potential is d dr φ(s(r), p) = −p · d dr s(r) = − X i pisi(r).
The spherical scoring rule [4] is defined by si(r) def = ri/||r||.
On its own, this strong ex post equivalence is not completely satisfying, because in any non-trivial game there is uncertainty about the value of p, and the different scaling ratios for different p could lead to different ex ante optimal behavior.
For all p, 1 ≤ μp ≤ √ 2, (or more generally for an  ndimensional probability vector p, 1 ≤ μp = 1 |p| ≤ √ n, by the arithmetic mean-root mean square inequality), and the result follows immediately.
Proper scoring rules are tools used to reward forecasters who predict the probability distribution of an event.
Now, let p denote the vector [p, 1 − p].
One  positive effect of this design is that a single trader would still have incentive to trade, which is equivalent to updating the scoring rule report to reflect her information, thereby  eliminating the problem of thin markets and illiquidity.
At this point, it is 321 convenient to use vector notation.
This makes the  projection game valuable as a design tool; for example, we can analyze new constraints and rules in the projection game, and then implement them via the SSR.
The score curves in the figure are defined by {(s1(r), s2(r)) | r = (r, 1 − r), r ∈ [0, 1]}.
We can extend this to an arbitrary collection3 of (not necessarily contiguous) moves X = {[x1, x1], [x2, x2], · · · , [xl, xl]}.
Suppose the forecaster predicts that the probabilities of the events are r = (rA, rB), with rA + rB = 1.
We describe this in the simple setting of two exhaustive,  mutually exclusive events A and B.
For simplicity, assume that F has a density  function f. (The result holds even for non-continuous  distributions).
3 We allow the collection to contain repeated moves, i.e., it is a multiset.
The Market Scoring Rule (MSR) was introduced by  Hanson [6].
Hanson"s innovation was to turn the scoring rules into instruments that can be traded, thereby providing traders who have new information an incentive to trade.
To prove part (ii), we simply restrict the integral to values in I.
Then, let c = R 1 0 μpf(p)dp.
For r = (rA, rB), define the  corresponding coordinates x = ( rA√ r2 A+r2 B , rB√ r2 A+r2 B ).
The definition generalizes naturally to higher  dimensions.
