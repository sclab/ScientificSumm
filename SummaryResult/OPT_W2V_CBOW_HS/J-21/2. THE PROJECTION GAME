The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .
Then, the total cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the moves is equal to the payoff of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )].
By Lemma 2, there is always a path from x to the positive p-line with 0 cost, which is given by an arc of the circle with center at the origin and radius |x|.
In addition, when x moves along the positive p-line, the payoff is equal to the cost, P(x, x ) = |x | − |x|.
Note, the potential is positive for x off the positive p-line and zero for x on the line.
The two cost function formulations are equivalent: C[x, x ] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = |x |−|x| ∀x, x , where e is the unit vector giving the direction of move.
317 total holding of shares in A, and y corresponds to the  holding of shares in B.
The game starts at (0, 0), but the market maker makes the first move; without loss of generality, we can assume the move is to (1, 1).
One drawback of the definition of a projection game is that implementing the payoffs requires us to know the  actual probability p. This is feasible if the probability can eventually be determined statistically, such as when  predicting the relative frequency of different recurring events, or vote shares.

Finally, a point on the positive p-line gets projected to itself, namely q · x = |x| so when the movement is along the positive p-line, P(x, x ) = q · (x − x) = |x | − |x| = C[x, x ].
The eventual profit of a move [x, x ], where x = x + l.(ex, ey), is profit[x, x ] = P[x, x ] − C[x, x ] = lq.e − C[x, x ] Differentiating with respect to l, we get d(profit) dl = q.e − c(x + le, e) = q.e − x + le |x + le| .e We observe that this is 0 if p(y + ley) = (1 − p)(x + lex), in other words, when the vectors q and (x + le) are exactly aligned.
By the path-independence property and Lemma 2, the profit of move [x, x ] is profit(x, x ) = profit(x, z) + profit(z, z ) + profit(z , x ) = (|x| − x · q) + 0 + (x · q − |x |) = φ(x, p) − φ(x , p).

We invite them to play the game described below: At any point in the game, there is a current state  described by a pair of parameters, (x, y), which we sometimes write in vector form as x.
On the other hand, if there were two paths from (x, y) to (x , y ) with different profits, there would be a cyclic path with positive profit.
Thus, the profit of the move is equal to the change in profit potential between the endpoints.
When x moves along a circle centered at the origin to point ¯x on the positive p-line, the corresponding payoff is P(x, ¯x) = |x| − x · q, and the cost is C[x, ¯x] = 0.
In each move of the game, one player (say i) plays an arrow (or segment) from (x, y) to (x , y ).
Also, any movement along the p-line has 0 additional profit.
The instantaneous price is c(x, e) = x · e/|x| = cos(x, e), where e is the direction of movement, and the result follows.
Intuitively, x corresponds to the 2 Here, we are referring only to manipulation of the  information market for later gain from the market itself; we do not consider the possibility of traders having vested interests in the underlying events.
The total cost of the move is the price integrated over the segment [(x, y) → (x , y )], i.e., C[(x, y) → (x , y )] = Z l w=0 c((x+wex, y +wey), (ex, ey))dw We assume that the game terminates after a finite number of moves.
The payoff to agent i for a segment [(x, y) → (x , y )] is given by: P([(x, y) → (x , y )]) = qx(x − x) + qy(y − y) = q.
Note that the price depends only on the angle between the line joining the vector (ˆx, ˆy) and the segment [(x, y), (x , y )], and not the lengths.
Further, we observe that the price is non-decreasing with increasing l. Thus, along the direction e, the profit is maximized at the point of intersection with the p-line.
At the end of the game, the true probability p of event A is determined, and the agents receive payoffs for the moves they made.
[Path-Independence] Suppose there is a sequence of moves leading from (x, y) to (x , y ).
The profit of a move [x, x ] is equal to the  difference in potential φ(x, p) − φ(x , p).
We now consider the question of which moves are  profitable in this game.
Next we show that a move to a lower potential is always profitable.
From Part 1, the cost of moving from x to the origin is C[x, 0] = Z l w=0 cos(x + we, e)dw = Z l w=0 (−1)dw = −|x|, where l = |x|, e = x/|x|.
Denote z = |x|q and z = |x |q, i.e., these are the points of intersection of the positive p-line with the  circles centered at the origin with radii |x| and |x | respectively.
The instantaneous price for moving along a line through the origin is 1 or −1, when the move is away or toward the origin respectively.
Each move has a cost associated with it, given by C[x, x ] = |x | − |x|, where | · | denotes the Euclidean norm, |x| = p x2 + y2.
(x − x) We call the line through the origin with slope (1 − p)/p = qy/qx the p-line.
Although simple, path independence of profits is vitally important, because it implies (and is implied by) the  absence of arbitrage in the market.
The players append directed line segments in turn, and the payoff player i finally receives for a move is the projection of her segment onto the line with slope (1 − p)/p.
We call l the volume of the move, and (ex, ey) the direction of the move.
The moves, costs and payoffs have a natural geometric representation, which is shown in Figure 1 for three  players with one move each.
At any point (ˆx, ˆy), there is an instantaneous price charged, defined as follows: c((ˆx, ˆy), (ex, ey)) = ˆxex + ˆyey |(ˆx, ˆy)| = ˆx · e |ˆx| .
Suppose player i moves from (x, y) to (x , y ).
Since ¯x is on the positive p-line, q·¯x = |¯x| = |x|, hence P(x, ¯x) = q · (¯x − x) = |x| − x · q; the cost is 0 from the definition.
In other words, there is no sequence of moves that start and end at the same point, but result in a positive profit.
We also assume throughout that players are risk-neutral.
We use the notation [(x, y) → (x , y )] or [x, x ] to  denote this move.
For ease of reference, we summarize some more useful properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection game.
Thus, for any point x, we can define the profit potential φ(x, p) by φ(x, p) = |x| − x · q.
Note that none of the variables are constrained to be  nonnegative, and hence, the cost of a move can be negative.
The instantaneous price along a circle centered at the origin is 0.
This lemma offers another way of seeing that it is optimal to move to the point of lowest potential, namely to the p-line.
We can write (x , y ) as (x + lex, y + ley), such that l ≥ 0 and |ex|2 + |ey|2 = 1.
In this section, we describe an abstract betting game, the projection game; in the following sections, we will argue that both the MSR and the DPM are strategically similar to the projection game.
All subsequent moves are made by players, in an arbitrary (and potentially repeating) sequence.
Her cost is the difference of distances of the endpoints of her move to the origin.
The cost can be expressed in an alternative form, that is also useful.
For clarity of exposition, here and in the rest of the paper we assume the space is two dimensional, i.e., there are only two possible events.
It is also feasible for one-off events in which there is reason to believe that the true probability is either 0 or 1.
(In other words, B is the same as not A.)
By the path-independence property, C[x, x ] = C[x, 0] + C[0, x ] = |x | − |x|.
For other one-off events, it cannot be implemented directly (unlike scoring rules, which can be implemented in expectation).
Note that the payoff, too, may be negative.
There are n agents who may have information about the likelihood of A and B, and we (the designers) would like to aggregate their information.
2.1 Strategicproperties oftheprojectiongame We begin our strategic analysis of the projection game by observing the following simple path-independence property.
However, we believe that even in these cases, the projection game can be useful as a conceptual and  analytical tool.
Let q = (qx, qy) = (p,1−p) |(p,1−p)| .
Suppose there are two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, A and B.
The projection game is conceptually simpler than MSR and DPM, and hence should prove easier to analyze.

Our results easily generalize to more than two dimensions.
