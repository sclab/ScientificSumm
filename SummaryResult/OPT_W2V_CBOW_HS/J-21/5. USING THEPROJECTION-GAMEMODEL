If traders were playing their myopically optimal strategies, here is how the market should run: If trader 1 sees a 0, he would move to some point Y that is between A and C, but closer to C. Trader 2 would then infer that trader 1 received a 0 signal and move to A or C if she got 1 or 0 respectively.
Observe also that a strategy profile in which neither trader moved in the first two rounds, and trader 1 moved to either X or Y would be a subgame-perfect equilibrium in this setup.
A plausible model of real trader behavior might include some form of inertia or -optimality: We assume that traders will trade if their expected profit is greater than some constant .
323 5.1 Traders with inertia The standard analysis of the trader behavior in any of the market forms we have studied asserts that traders who  disagree with the market probabilities will expect to gain from changing the probability, and thus have a strict incentive to trade in the market.
Then, when trader 2 moved to, say, D, trader 1 could correct the rating to A.
Suppose that the prior distribution of the signals is that trader 1 is equally likely to get a 0 or a 1, but trader 2 gets a 0 with probability 0.55 and a 1 with probability 0.45.
Further,  because DA and BC are longer than XY , and parallel to XY , their projection on the final p-line will always be greater 324 in absolute value than the projection of XY , regardless of what the true p-line is!
Consider the simple projection game restricted to a  circular arc with unit radius; as we have seen, this  corresponds closely to the spherical market scoring rule, and to the dynamic parimutuel market under a reasonable  constraint.
If trader 1 had got a 1, he would move to a different point X instead, and trader 2 would move to D if she saw 1 and B if she saw 0.
In  Section 3, we used the projection-game model of the DPM to prove the absence of arbitrage, and to infer strategic  properties that might have been difficult to deduce otherwise.
Then, his expected gain can be calculated, as follows: Let q and q be the unit vectors in the directions of p and p respectively.
If we let θ and θ be the angles of the p-line and p -line respectively (from the x-axis), we get E = 1 − cos(θ − θ ); when θ is close to θ , a Taylor series approximation gives us that E ≈ (θ − θ )2 /2.
To show that this is a profitable deviation, observe that this strategy is equivalent to  playing two additional moves over trader 1"s myopic strategy of moving to Y .
In practice, an informed trader can potentially profit by playing a suboptimal strategy to mislead other traders, in a way that allows her to profit later.
Thus, the deception would result in a strictly higher expected profit for trader 1.
(Note that the impact of trader 2"s signal is in a different direction, depending on trader 1"s signal).
The exact position of the points does not matter; all we need is the relative position, and the observation that, because of the perfect symmetry in the setup, segments XY, BC, and AD are all parallel to each other.
We do not attempt to justify this model here; rather, we illustrate how the projection game may be used to analyze such situations, and shed some light on how to modify the trading rules to alleviate this problem.
Then, the trader"s expected profit would be E = r(1 − cos(θ − θ )).
This  essentially provides a form of discounting that motivates trader 1 to take his profit early rather than mislead trader 2.
Trader 1 has no reason to move again.
The idea is that, instead of restricting all moves to being on the unit circle, we force each move to have a slightly larger radius than the previous move.
Using the projection game, it is easy to show that, if traders consider non-myopic strategies, this set of  strategies is not an equilibrium.
If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.1.
In this section, we illustrate how the projection game can be used to analyze an instance of this phenomenon, and to design market rules that mitigate this effect.
Now, even if the market maker seeded the market with r = 1, it would increase with each trade, and the incentives to sharpen the estimate increase with every trade.
Again, trader 1 would not want to move again.
If trader 1 gets the signal 0, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.3.
Note that this problem is not specific to the projection game form: Our equivalence results show that it could arise in the MSR or DPM (perhaps with a different prior distribution and  different numerical values).
The  expected profit is given by E = φ(q, p ) = 1− q ·q .
Graphically, the right reduction factor would make the segments AD and BC shorter than XY (as they are chords on a smaller circle), thus making the myopic strategy optimal. 
5.2 Analyzing long-term strategies Up to this point, our analysis has been restricted to trader strategies that are myopic in the sense that traders do not consider the impact of their trades on other traders"  beliefs.
Now, suppose a market operator faced with this situation wanted to sharpen the accuracy of the market.
If trader 1 gets 1, and trader 2 gets signal 0, the optimal probability is 0.7.
Thus, we can derive a bound on the limit of the market accuracy: The market price will not change as long as (θ − θ )2 ≤ 2 .
In this section, we provide two examples that illustrate the power of projection-game analysis for gaining insight about more complex strategic settings.
If trader 1 got a 0, but trader 2 got a 1, the optimal probability is 0.9.
He could move to X instead of Y , to mislead trader 2 into thinking he got a 1.
Now, suppose the market probability is p, and a trader believes the true probability is p .
Then, trader 1 has the option of placing a last-minute trade just before the market closes.
Thus, the trader will trade only if 1−q·q > .
Pt 00 C D11 10 01 Event does not happenEventhappens B A Figure 4: Example illustrating non-myopic  deception Suppose that, for some exogenous reason, trader 1 has the opportunity to trade, followed by trader 2.
Suppose we insist that, if the current radius is r, the next trader has to move to r + 1.
One natural approach is simply to multiply all payoffs by a constant.
Using the same approximation as above, the trader would trade as long as (θ − θ )2 > 2 /r.
However, it will also increase the market-maker"s exposure to loss: the market-maker would have to pump in more money to achieve this.
There are two traders speculating on the probability of an event E, who each get a 1-bit signal.
The first move, Y X may either move toward or away from the optimal final position.
We suggest that one approach to mitigating this problem might be by reducing the radius at every move.
The projection game model suggests a natural approach to improving the accuracy while retaining the same bounds on the market maker"s loss.
This corresponds to using a larger circle in the projection game, and would indeed improve the accuracy.
The second move, DA or BC, is always in the correct direction.
The traders are playing the projection game restricted to a circular arc.
The optimal probability for each  2bit signal pair is as follows.
The chief advantages of the projection game are that it is analytically tractable, and also easy to visualize.
The scenario we consider is as follows.
Now, suppose trader 1 got a 0.
The expected gain may, however, be very small.
