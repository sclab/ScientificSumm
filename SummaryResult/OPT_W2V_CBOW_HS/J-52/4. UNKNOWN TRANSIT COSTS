We will show that FPSS induces an equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal their transit costs and forward packets if they are on the LCP.
4.2 Discussion More generally, for any mechanism M that induces a bid vector b in equilibrium by making a payment of pi(b) to node i on the LCP, there exists a mechanism M that induces an equilibrium with the same bid vector and packet forwarding by making a payment of: sB i = 0 sG i = pi(b) (1 − k)n−i+1 .
Let the payments of FPSS be: sB i = 0 sG i = pi (1 − k)n−i+1 Then, FPSS has a Nash equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal their transit costs and all nodes on the LCP forward packets.
The expected utility of a node not on the LCP is 0.
In addition to the generalization of FPSS into FPSS , we can also consider the generalization of the first-price auction (FPA) mechanism, where the principal determines the LCP and pays each node on the LCP its bid, pi(b) = bi.
In particular, with per-hop monitoring, the principal declares the payments sB i and sG i to each node upon failure or success of delivery to the next node.
From 1 and 2, we get that if a node i can increase its expected utility by deviating from bi under M , it can also increase its utility by deviating from bi in M, but this is in contradiction to bi being an equilibrium in M. 4.
For example, in topologies with parallel disjoint paths from source to destination, we can prove that under first-price  auctions, the loss to the principal is the difference between the cost of the shortest path and the second-shortest path, and the loss is higher under the FPSS mechanism. 
In this section, we consider both hidden information and hidden action, and generalize these mechanisms to induce both truth revelation and high-effort action in  equilibrium, where nodes transmit over a lossy communication channel, i.e., k ≥ 0.
First, we find that the expected total payment made by the principal under the proposed mechanisms is E[S] = nX i=1 (1 − k)i pi(b) and the expected benefit realized by the principal is E[w] = (1 − k)n+1 wG where Pn i=1 pi and wG are the expected payment and expected benefit, respectively, when only the hidden-information problem is considered.
(a) if it reports bi > ci: i. if bi < P r Ir(b|i ∞)br − P r=i Ir(b)br, it is still on the LCP, and since the payment is independent of bi, its utility does not change.
If all nodes truthfully reveal their costs and forward packets, the expected utility of node i on the LCP is: E[u]i = Pr(xG S→i)(E[si] − ci) + Pr(xB S→i)sB i = (1 − k)i  (1 − k)n−i+1 sG i + (1 − (1 − k)n−i+1 )sB i − ci  + (1 − (1 − k)i )sB i = (1 − k)i (1 − k)n−i+1 pi (1 − k)n−i+1 − (1 − k)i ci = (1 − k)i (pi − ci) ≥ 0 (12) The last inequality is derived from the fact that FPSS is a truthful mechanism, thus pi ≥ ci.
(b) if it reports bi < ci: i. if bi < P r Ir(b|i ∞)br − P r=i Ir(b)br, it joins the LCP, and gains an expected utility of E[u]i = (1 − k)i (pi − ct) However, if i /∈ LCP, it means that ci > X r Ir(c|i ∞)cr − X r=i Ir(c)cr But if all nodes truthfully reveal their costs, pi = X r Ir(c|i ∞)cr − X r=i Ir(c)cr < ci therefore, E[u]i < 0 ii.
Following FPSS [13], the payment received by node i at  equilibrium is: pi = biIi(b) + [ X r Ir(b|i ∞)br − X r Ir(b)br] = X r Ir(b|i ∞)br − X r=i Ir(b)br (11) where the expression b|i x means that (b|i x)j = cj for all j = i, and (b|i x)i = x.
In order to prove the proposition above, we have to show that nodes have no incentive to engage in the following  misbehaviors: 1. truthfully reveal cost but drop packet, 2. lie about cost and forward packet, 3. lie about cost and drop packet.
Therefore, there exists an equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal their transit costs and forward the received packets.
Given the payments sB i = 0 and sG i = pi/(1 − k), it is a dominant strategy for the nodes to reveal costs truthfully and forward packets.
Mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for the routing game [24, 13] assume that once the transit costs have been obtained, and the LCP has been determined, the nodes on the LCP obediently forward all packets, and that there is no loss in the network, i.e., k = 0.
In FPSS , each node i submits a bid bi, which is its reported transit cost.
In hidden-information problems, the principal employs  mechanisms to induce truthful revelation of private information from the agents.
if bi > P r Ir(b|i ∞)br − P r=i Ir(b)br, it will not be on the LCP and obtain E[u]i = 0, which is less than its expected utility if truthfully revealing its cost.
Therefore, in a lossless network, we should not see any gap between expected benefits and payments, independent of strategic or non-strategic forwarding behavior.
In the first stage, the sender declares two payment functions, (sG i , sB i ), that will be paid upon success or failure of packet delivery.
We next show that nodes cannot gain utility from misbehavior (2).
121 (b) if it reports bi < ci, it is still on the LCP, and since the payment is independent of bi, its utility does not change.
In the current setting with both hidden information and hidden action, FPSS achieves a Nash equilibrium in the absence of per-hop monitoring, and a dominant strategy equilibrium in the presence of per-hop monitoring, consistent with the results in section 3 where there is hidden action only.
4.1 V CG Mechanism In their seminal paper [24], Nisan and Ronen present a VCG mechanism that induces truthful revelation of transit costs by edges 120 Figure 4: Game structure for F P SS, where only hidden-information is considered.
Given these payments, nodes have incentive to reveal their costs truthfully, and later to forward packets.
in a biconnected network, such that lowest cost paths can be  chosen.
In FPSS , we compute sB i and sG i as a function of pi, k, and n. First, we recognize that sB i must be less than or equal to zero in order for the true LCP to be chosen.
When hidden action is also taken into consideration, the generalized mechanism handles strategic forwarding behavior by conditioning payments upon the final outcome, and accounts for lossy communication channels by designing payments that reflect the distribution of risk.
Like all VCG mechanisms, it is a strategyproof mechanism, meaning that it induces truthful revelation in a dominant strategy equilibrium.
FPSS assumes that transit nodes are  obedient in packet forwarding behavior, and will not update the counters without exerting high effort in packet forwarding.
In the routing game, the principal wishes to extract transit cost information from the network routers in order to determine the lowest cost path (LCP) for a given source-destination pair.
if bi > P r Ir(b|i ∞)br − P r=i Ir(b)br, it  remains out of the LCP, so its utility does not change.
Then, these nodes can drop any packets they receive, incur zero transit cost, collect a payment of sB i > 0, and earn positive profit.
Therefore, nodes cannot gain utility from misbehaviors (1) or (3).
Under FPSS, transit nodes keep track of the amount of traffic routed through them via counters, and payments are  periodically transferred from the principals to the transit nodes based on the counter values.
While it is simple to characterize the principal"s loss in some special cases, it is not a trivial problem in general.
In this section, we present FPSS , which generalizes FPSS to operate in an environment with lossy communication channels (i.e., k ≥ 0) and strategic behavior in terms of packet forwarding.
The expected utility of a LCP node is E[u]i = (1 − k)i (pi(b) − ci) ≥ 0 if it forwards and 0 if it drops, and the expected utility of a non-LCP node is 0.
Nodes have no incentive to drop packets since they derive an expected utility of 0 if they do.
Node i is said to be truthful if bi = ci.
The difference between expected payment and benefit is not due to strategic forwarding behavior, but to lossy communications.
Payments are transferred based on the final outcome.
What is the principal"s loss due to the lack of knowledge of the transit costs?
Let Ii(b) be the indicator function for the LCP given the bid vector b such that Ii(b) =  1 if i is on the LCP; 0 otherwise.
Otherwise, strategic nodes may have an incentive to report extremely small costs to mislead the principal into believing that they are on the LCP.
A node that drops a packet receives sB i = 0, which is smaller than or equal to E[u]i for i ∈ LCP and equals E[u]i for i /∈ LCP.
(a) if it reports bi > ci, it remains out of the LCP, so its utility does not change.
, bn) of bids submitted by all transit nodes.
Therefore, we should expect the generalization of FPA to achieve Nash equilibrium with or without monitoring.
slightly modify the model to have the routers as the selfish agents instead of the edges, and present a distributed algorithm that computes the VCG payments.
In certain network settings, the transit costs of nodes along the forwarding path may not be common knowledge, i.e., there exists the problem of hidden information.
Is it possible to design contracts that induce cooperative  behavior in the presence of both hidden-action and  hiddeninformation?
This price greatly depends on the network topology and on the mechanism employed.
Second, the loss to the principal due to unknown transit costs is also known as the price of frugality, and is an active field of  research [2, 12].
IM i (b) = IM i (b)∀i, since M uses the same choice metric.
The  network routers act strategically and declare transit costs to maximize their profit.
A sketch of the proof would be as follows: 1.
We note that in the hidden information only context, FPSS  induces truthful revelation as a dominant strategy equilibrium.
First-price auctions achieve Nash equilibrium as opposed to dominant strategy equilibrium.
The timeline of the FPSS game is presented in  figure 4.
