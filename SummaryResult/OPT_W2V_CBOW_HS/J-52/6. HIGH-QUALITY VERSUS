In the high-quality versus low-quality  forwarding model, if negative payments are disallowed, the expected payment to each node exceeds its expected cost under the optimal contract.
In the high-quality versus low-quality  forwarding model, where transit costs are common knowledge, the principal derives the same expected utility whether it obtains  perhop monitoring information or not.
While the expected outcome depends on m, it is independent of which specific m nodes are induced.
Formally, the probability that a packet successfully gets from node i to node i + 1 is: Pr(xG i→i+1|ai) = 1 − (k − qai) (14) where: q ∈ (0, 1] and k ∈ (q, 1] In the drop versus forward model, a low-effort action by any node results in a delivery failure.
Individual autonomous systems (AS"s) can either adopt hot-potato routing or early exit routing (a = 0), where a packet is handed off to the downstream AS at the first possible exit, or late exit routing (a = 1), where an AS carries the packet longer than it needs to, handing off the packet at an exit closer to the destination.
Therefore, it may be possible for the principal to  maximize its utility by contracting with only m of the n nodes along the path.
LOW-QUALITY FORWARDING So far, we have considered the agents" strategy space to be  limited to the drop (a = 0) and forward (a = 1) actions.
Under the optimal contract, sB i = (1−k+q)i c(k−1) q < 0 Therefore, under any other contract the sender will have to  compensate each node with an expected payment that is higher than its expected transit cost.
In both examples, in the absence of contracts, a rational node would exert low-effort, resulting in lower performance.
If monitoring is used, we obtain the following  constraints: (IC) : (1 − k + q)sG i + (k − q)sB i − c ≥ (1 − k)sG i + (k)sB i (IR) : (1 − k + q)i ((1 − k + q)sG i + (k − q)sB i − c) ≥ 0 and we get the solution: sB i = c(k − 1) q sG i = ck q The expected payment by the principal with or without forwarding is the same, and equals: E[S] = c(1 − k + q)(1 − (1 − k + q)n ) k − q (17) and this concludes the proof.
14 to reflect the different model: (IC) : (1−k +q)n−i+1 sG i +(1−(1−k +q)n−i+1 )sB i −c ≥ (1 − k)(1 − k + q)n−i sG i + (1 − (1 − k)(1 − k + q)n−i )sB i (IR) : (1 − k + q)i ((1 − k + q)n−i+1 sG i +(1 − (1 − k + q)n−i+1 )sB i − c) + (1 − (1 − k + q)i )sB i ≥ 0 For this set of constraints, we obtain the following solution: sB i = (1 − k + q)i c(k − 1) q (15) sG i = (1 − k + q)i c(k − 1 + (1 − k + q)−n ) q (16) We observe that in this version, both the high and the low payments depend on i.
In particular, at the optimal contract, the low-outcome  payment sB i is now less than zero.
Under the optimal contract, E[si] equals node i s expected cost 3.
In contrast to drop versus forward, a packet may still reach the next hop (albeit with a lower probability) even if the low-effort action is taken.
A negative payment means that the agent must pay the principal in the event that the packet fails to reach the destination.
At the same time, the  individual expected payments decrease in i (see Eq.
In contrast, in high versus low-quality forwarding, a success may occur under the low effort actions as well, and payments are used to increase the probability of success.
In drop versus forward, a principal either signs a contract with all n nodes along the path or with none.
Nevertheless, this behavior can be avoided with an appropriate design of contracts.
In contrast, a node in the high/low scenario may exert low-effort and hope to free-ride on the  higheffort level exerted by the other agents.
The payment structure in the high-quality versus low-quality  forwarding model is different from that in the drop versus forward model.
Therefore, a principal who wishes to sign a contract with only m out of the n nodes should do so with the nodes that are closest to the destination; namely, nodes (n − m + 1, ..., n − 1, n).
The proof is a direct outcome of the following  statements, which are proved above: 1.
Solving for the high-quality versus low-quality forwarding model with unknown transit costs is left for future work. 
The IC and IR constraints are the same as specified in the proof of proposition 3.1, but their values change, based on Eq.
This prevents the first-best solution from being achieved.
This is because a single node dropping the packet determines a failure.
The optimal contract is the contract specified in equations 15 and 16 2.
This may correspond to a service-differentiated service model where packets are forwarded on a best-effort or a priority basis [6].
In the absence of explicit  incentives, it is not surprising that AS"s choose hot-potato routing to minimize their costs, even though it leads to suboptimal routes [28, 29].
In some settings, it may be necessary to impose a limited liability constraint, i.e., si ≥ 0.
In this  section, we consider a variation of the model where the agents choose between providing a low-quality service (a = 0) and a high-quality service (a = 1).
124 There is an additional difference between the two models.
As a second example, consider the practice of hot-potato routing in inter-domain routing of today"s Internet.
