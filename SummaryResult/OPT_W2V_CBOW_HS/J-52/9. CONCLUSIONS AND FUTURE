In addition, in scenarios of unknown transit costs, it is also possible to design mechanisms that induce cooperative behavior in equilibrium, but the sender pays a premium for extracting information from the  transit nodes.
We  conclude that monitoring per-hop outcomes may not improve the  utility of the participants or the network performace.
DIRECTIONS In this paper we show that in a multi-hop routing setting, where the actions of the intermediate nodes are hidden from the source 125 and/or destination, it is possible to design payment schemes to  induce cooperative behavior from the intermediate nodes.
We plan to study under what mechanisms this strategy profile may emerge as a unique equilibrium (e.g., penalty by successor nodes).
Our preliminary results show that when several senders compete for a single transit node"s  capacity, the sender with the highest demand pays a premium even if transit costs are common knowledge.
• While the proposed payment schemes sustain cooperation in equilibrium, it is not a unique equilibrium.
• Fully characterize the full-information Nash equilibrium in first price auctions, and use this characterization to derive its overcharging compared to truthful mechaisms. 
In addition, if congestion affects the probability of  successful delivery, a sender with a lower cost alternate path may end up with a lower utility level than his rival with a higher cost alternate path.
• Analyze the feasibility of recursive contracts under  hiddeninformation of transit costs.
• Consider the effect of congestion and capacity constraints on the proposed mechanisms.
The premium can be expressed as a function of the second-highest demand.
Our model and results suggest several natural and intriguing  research avenues: • Consider manipulative or collusive behaviors which may arise under the proposed payment schemes.
