Specifically, this  paper makes the following contributions: • We present the design and analysis of Bullet, an  overlay construction algorithm that creates a mesh over any distribution tree and allows overlay participants to achieve a higher bandwidth throughput than  traditional data streaming.
In this paper, we argue that, in fact, an overlay mesh is able to deliver fundamentally higher bandwidth.
• We provide a technique for recovering missing data from peers in a scalable and efficient manner.
This paper presents the design and implementation of Bullet, a scalable and efficient overlay construction algorithm that overcomes this challenge to deliver significant bandwidth improvements relative to traditional tree structures.
As a related benefit, we  eliminate the overhead required to probe for available  bandwidth in traditional distributed tree construction  techniques.
• A large-scale evaluation of 1000 overlay participants running in an emulated 20,000 node network  topology, as well as experimentation on top of the  PlanetLab Internet testbed, shows that Bullet running over a random tree can achieve twice the throughput of streaming over a traditional bandwidth tree.
Of course, a number of difficult  challenges must be overcome to ensure that nodes in the mesh do not repeatedly receive the same data from peers.
Typically, high bandwidth overlay data streaming takes place over a distribution tree.
• We propose a mechanism for making data disjoint and then distributing it in a uniform way that makes the probability of finding a peer containing missing data equal for all nodes.
RanSub periodically disseminates summaries of data sets received by a changing, uniformly random subset of global participants.
