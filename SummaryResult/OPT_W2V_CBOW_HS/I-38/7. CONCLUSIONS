We have presented two algorithms, pausebid and  cachedpausebid, that bidder agents can use to engage in a PAUSE auction.
With this auction, we can even envision completely eliminating the auctioneer and, instead, have  every agent performe the task of the auctioneer.
As expected the revenue generated by a PAUSE auction is lower than the revenue of a revenue-maximizing solution found by a  centralized winner determination algorithm, however we found that cachedpausebid generates in average 4.7% higher  revenue than pausebid.
Moreover, because of the design of the PAUSE auction, the agents in the auction also have an incentive to perform the required computation.
We also found that the revenue  generated by our algorithms increases as function of the number of items in the auction.
Both algorithms implement a myopic utility  maximizing strategy that is guaranteed to find the bidset that maximizes the agent"s utility given the set of outstanding best bids at any given time, without considering possible future bids.
Both algorithms find, most of the time, the same distribution of items as the revenue-maximizing  solution.
We believe that distributed solutions to the winner  determination problem should be studied as they offer a better fit for some applications as when, for example, agents do not want to reveal their valuations to the auctioneer or when we wish to distribute the computational load among the bidders.
As it is an NP-Hard problem, the running time of our  algorithms remains exponential but it is significantly better than a full search.
Our bidding algorithms can be used by any multiagent system that would use combinatorial auctions for coordination but would rather not implement a centralized auctioneer. 
cachedpausebid caches partial solutions and performs a branch and bound search only on the few portions affected by the changes on the bids between consecutive times.
Our algorithms have shown that it is feasible to implement the complex coordination constraints supported by  combinatorial auctions without having to resort to a centralized winner determination algorithm.
The cases where our algorithms failed to arrive at that distribution are those where there was a large gap between the first and second valuation for a set (or sets) of items.
The PAUSE auction is one of a few approaches to decentralize the winner determination problem in  combinatorial auctions.
However, while PAUSE establishes the rules the bidders must obey, it does not tell us how the bidders should calculate their bids.
cachedpausebid has a better performance since it explores fewer nodes (less than half) and it is faster.
pausebid performs a branch and bound search completely from scratch each time it is invoked.
