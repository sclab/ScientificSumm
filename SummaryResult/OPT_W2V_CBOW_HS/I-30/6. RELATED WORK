The focus of that work is distributed coalition formation among agents, but in our approach, we do not need agents to form groups before allocating tasks.
Compared to these works, our approach is more general in the sense that we are able to model different types of connections or constraints among agents for  different problem domains in addition to supply chain formation.
Other work [17] proposes a location mechanism for open multiagent systems to  allocate tasks to unknown agents.
Their focus is on modeling the  decision process of just a single mediator.
Previous work has shown how to learn which relations are more beneficial in the long run [8], and adapt the social network accordingly.
However, most of the research to date on task allocation does not consider social  connections among agents, and studies the problem in a centralized The Sixth Intl.
The analysis of the  communication complexity of this method is based on lattice-like graphs, while we investigate how to efficiently solve task  allocation in a social network, whose topology can be arbitrary.
In contrast to this work, we introduce also an efficient completely distributed protocol that takes the social network into account.
Easwaran and Pitt [6] study ‘complex tasks" that require ‘services" for their accomplishment.
Networks have been employed in the context of task  allocation in some other works as well, for example to limit the 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Time(ms) Agents upper bound - small-world upper bound - random upper bound - scale-free GDAP - small-world GDAP - random GDAP - scale-free Figure 7: The run time of the GDAP algorithm.

The proposed protocol is centralized, where one manager is responsible for allocating the tasks to all coalitions.
Here, the network is given, and the problem is to select a subgraph, for which the  authors propose a market-based algorithm, in particular, a  series of auctions.
In order to apply their approach, agents need to have some knowledge about the geographical positions of tasks and some other agents.
Finally, social networks have been used in the context of team formation.
Task allocation in multiagent systems has been  investigated by many researchers in recent years with different  assumptions and emphases.
[14] discuss the possibilities of achieving efficient allocations in both cooperative and  noncooperative settings.
Another study of task allocation in supply chains is [21], where it is argued that the defining characteristic of Supply Chain Formation is hierarchical subtask  decomposition (HSD).
Agents are then allowed to move and actively search for tasks, and the capability of agents to perform tasks is  homogeneous.
In this approach each agent caches a list of agents they know.
Another approach is to partition the network into cliques of nodes, representing coalitions which the agents involved may use as a  coordination mechanism [20].
We believe these  results can be transferred to the domain of task allocation as well, leaving this as a topic for further study.
The problem concerns the allocation of subtasks to service providers in a supply chain.
HSD is implemented using task dependency networks (TDN), with agents and goods as nodes, and I/O relations between them as edges.
[12] develop an auction protocol that enables agents to form coalitions with time constraints.
It assumes each agent knows the capabilities of all others.
Mediators in this context are agents who receive the task and have  connections to other agents.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 
They propose distributed algorithms with low communication complexity for forming coalitions in large-scale multiagent systems.
They break up the task into subtasks, and negotiate with other agents to obtain commitments to execute these subtasks.
However, they do not assume the existence of any agent network.
[16] introduces computational geometry-based algorithms for distributed task allocation in geographical  domains.
interactions between agents and mediators [1].
They propose a centralized algorithm to find the optimal solution.
