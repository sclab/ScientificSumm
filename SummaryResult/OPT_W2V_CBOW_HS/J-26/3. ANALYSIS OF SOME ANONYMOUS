Thus, there exists a region in which the optimal numbers of contracted agents in the agency and the non-strategic cases are 0 and n, respectively.
7 AND technology with any number of agents n and any γ, and any identical cost c. 8 v∗ is a function of n, γ, c. 23 • the price of unaccountability is obtained at the  transition point of the agency case, and is POU = ` 1 γ − 1 ´n−1 + (1 − γ 1 − γ ) Proof sketch: For any fixed number of contracted agents, k, the principal"s utility is a linear function in v, where the slope equals the success probability under k contracted agents.
Theorems 1 and 2 say that both the AND and OR  technologies exhibit the same transition behavior (changes of the optimal contract) in the agency and the non-strategic cases.
As the number of contracted agents is monotonic non-decreasing in the value (due to Lemma 3), for any v < v∗, contracting with 0 agents is optimal, and for any v > v∗, contracting with n agents is optimal.
For any given technology (t, c) the price of  unaccountability POU(t, c) is obtained at some value v which is a transition point, of either the agency or the non-strategic cases.
Similarly, for any value higher than the last  transition point, n agents are contracted in both cases, and the social welfare ratio is 1.
Proof sketch: To prove the claim we define vk to be the value for which the principal is indifferent between  contracting with k − 1 agents, and contracting with k agents.
Next we consider the OR technology and show that it exhibits all n transitions.
As for an anonymous t only the number of agents that exert effort is important, we can shorten the notations and denote tm = t(1m , 0n−m ), Δm = tm+1 − tm, pm = c Δm−1 and um = tm · (v − m · pm), for the case of identical cost c. 22 v 3 0 gamma 200 150 0.4 100 50 0.3 0 0.20.10 2 1 0 3 12000 6000 8000 4000 2000 gamma 0 0.4 0.45 10000 0.3 0.350.250.2 Figure 3: Number of agents in the optimal contract of the AND (left) and OR (right) technologies with 3 players, as a function of γ and v. AND technology: either 0 or 3 agents are contracted, and the transition value is monotonic in γ.
By Lemma 1 the POU is obtained at a transition point.
Now contracting with one agent is better than contracting with none whenever v > 52/9 (and is equivalent for v = 52/9), and contracting with both agents is better than  contracting with one agent whenever v > 128/3 (and is  equivalent for v = 128/3), thus the principal will contract with no agent for 0 ≤ v ≤ 52/9, with one agent for 52/9 ≤ v ≤ 128/3, and with both agents for v ≥ 128/3.
We are only able to determine the POU of the OR  technology for the case of two agents [2].
Notice that the POU is not bounded across the AND family of technologies (for various n, γ) as POU → ∞ either if γ → 0 (for any given n ≥ 2) or n → ∞ (for any fixed γ ∈ (0, 1 2 )).
Let us write down the expressions for the principal"s utility in these three cases: • 0 Agents: No agent is paid and the principal"s utility is u0 = t0 · v = 7v/16.
For any Majority technology (any n, γ and c), there exists l, 1 ≤ l ≤ n/2 such that the first transition is from 0 to l agents, and then all the remaining n − l transitions exist.

As γ decreases the first transition is at a lower value and to a higher number of agents.
POU = v∗ · tn − c · n v∗ · t0 = 1 + tn−1 t0 − tn−1 tn 2 3.3 The MAJORITY Technology The project under the MAJORITY function succeeds if the majority of the agents succeed in their tasks (see  Section 2.3).
AND technology with two agents, c = 1, γ = 1/4: we have t0 = γ2 = 1/16, t1 = γ(1 − γ) = 3/16, and t2 = (1 − γ)2 = 9/16 thus Δ0 = 1/8 and Δ1 = 3/8.
For AND technology tn−1 t0 = (1−γ)n−1 ·γ γn =  1 γ − 1 n−1 and tn−1 tn = (1−γ)n−1 ·γ (1−γ)n = γ 1−γ , and the expressions for the POU follows.
It turns out that the price of unaccountability here is 19/13, and is achieved at v = 52/9, which is exactly the transition point from 0 to 1 contracted agents in the agency case.
The transition point in the agency case is the point at which the principal is indifferent between contracting with 0 and with n agents, v∗ = c·n tn−t0 · tn tn−tn−1 .
For any value lower than the first transition point, 0 agents are contracted in both cases, and the social welfare ratio is 1.
Figure 4 presents the optimal number of contracted agents as a  function of v and γ, for n = 5.
As in both cases there is a single transition point, the claim about the price of unaccountability for AND  technology is proved as a special case of Lemma 2 below.
Let v∗ denote the point at which the principal is indifferent between contracting with 0 or n agents.
For any anonymous AND technology7 : • there exists a value8 v∗ < ∞ such that for any v < v∗ it is optimal to contract with no agent, for v > v∗ it is optimal to contract with all n agents, and for v = v∗, both contracts (0, n) are optimal.
Even for the 2 agents case we already observe a qualitative difference between the POU in the AND and OR technologies.
What is the POU for OR with n > 2 agents?
Let us write down the expressions for his utility in these 3 cases: • 0 Agents: No agent is paid thus and the principal"s utility is u0 = t0 · v = v/16.
OR technology with two agents, c = 1, γ = 1/4: we have t0 = 1 − (1 − γ)2 = 7/16, t1 = 1 − γ(1 − γ) = 13/16, and t2 = 1 − γ2 = 15/16 thus Δ0 = 3/8 and Δ1 = 1/8.
2 We already see a qualitative difference between the AND and OR technologies (even with 2 agents): in the first case either all agents are contracted or none, while in the second case, for some intermediate range of values v, exactly one agent is contracted.
The property of a single transition occurs in both the agency and the non-strategic cases, where the transition  occurs at a smaller value of v in the non-strategic case.
This is not a coincidence that in both the AND and OR technologies the POU is obtained for v that is a  transition point (see full proof in [2]).
As the social welfare ratio is decreasing in v in this region, the POU is obtained at the higher value, that is, at the transition point of the agency case.
This is true for both the agency and the non-strategic cases.
The principal will contract with no agent when v < 6, with both agents whenever v > 6, and with either non or both for v = 6.
We then show that for any k, vk < vk+1.
vk < v < vk+1, contracting with exactly k agents is optimal (for v < v1, no agent is contracted, and for v > vn, all n agents are contracted).
This characterization is a direct corollary of a more general characterization given in [2].
For any anonymous technology that has a  single transition in both the agency and the non-strategic cases, the POU is given by: POU = 1 + tn−1 t0 − tn−1 tn and it is obtained at the transition point of the agency case.
In [2] we show that at v∗, the  principal"s utility from contracting with 0 (or n) agents is higher than his utility when contracting with any number of agents k ∈ {1, .
While in the AND technology the POU for n = 2 is not bounded from above (for γ → 0), the highest POU in OR technology with two agents is 2 (for γ → 0).
Thus for example, for v = 6 the globally optimal decision (non-strategic case) would give a global utility of 6 · 9/16 − 2 = 11/8 while the principal"s decision (in the agency case) would give a global utility of 3/8, giving a ratio of 11/3.
• 1 Agent: This agent is paid p1 = c/Δ0 = 8/3 on success and the principal"s utility is u1 = t1(v − p1) = 13v/16 − 13/6.
We find that the conditions in the agency case are different than the ones in the non-strategic case.
For v = vk, the principal is indifferent between contracting with k − 1 or k agents.
For any sufficiently small γ, the first transition is to 3 = 5/2 agents, and for any sufficiently large γ, the first transition is to 1 agents.
Proof sketch: Since the payments in the agency case are higher than in the non-strategic case, the transition point in the agency case occurs for a higher value than in the non-strategic case.
Is it bounded by a constant for every n?
• 2 Agents: each agent is paid p2 = c/Δ1 = 8/3 on success, and the principal"s utility is u2 = t2(v−2p2) = 9v/16 − 3.
The principal has 3 possibilities: contracting with 0, 1, or 2 agents.
In the non-strategic case, in comparison, the principal will make a single agent exert effort for v > 8/3, and the second one exert effort as well when v > 8.
The phenomena that we observe in this example (and others that we looked at) leads us to the following conjecture.
Between any pair of consecutive points, the social welfare ratio is between two linear functions of v (the optimal contracts are fixed on such a segment).
We are able to determine the POU for any anonymous technology that exhibits a single transition in both the agency and the non-strategic cases (see full proof in [2]).
It turns out that this is the worst price of unaccountability in this example, and it is obtained exactly at the transition point of the agency case, as we show below.
As the number of  contracted agents is monotonic non-decreasing in the value (due to Lemma 3), v1 < v2 < .
• 1 Agent: This agent is paid p1 = c/Δ0 = 8 on success and the principal"s utility is u1 = t1(v − p1) = 3v/16− 3/2.
< vn is a sufficient condition for the theorem to hold.
In [2] we provide a full characterization of the sufficient and necessary conditions for general anonymous technologies to have a single  transition and all n transitions.
Moreover, for any fixed c, n, l = 1 when γ is close enough to 1 2 , l is a non-decreasing function of γ (with image {1, .
We are unable to characterize the transition  behavior of the MAJORITY technology analytically.
As there are finitely many such points, the global suprimum is obtained at the transition point with the maximal social welfare ratio.
OR technology: for any γ we can see all transitions.
• 2 Agents: each agent is paid p2 = c/Δ1 = 8 on  success, and the principal"s utility is u2 = t2(v − 2p2) = 15v/16 − 15/2.
2 In [2] we present a general characterization of technologies with a single transition in the agency and the non-strategic cases, and provide a full proof of Theorem 1 as a special case.
This should be contrasted with the non-strategic case in which the principal completely controls the agents (and bears their costs) and thus simply optimizes globally.
TECHNOLOGIES A success function t is called anonymous if it is symmetric with respect to the players.
, n/2 }), and l = n/2 when γ is close enough to 0. 
For any γ, the first transition is never to more than 3 agents, and after the first transition we see all following possible transitions.
Notice that the option of contracting with one agent is always inferior to either contracting with both or with none, and will never be taken by the principal.
2 The same behavior occurs in both the agency and the  nonstrategic case.
3.1 AND and OR Technologies Let us start with a direct and full analysis of the AND and OR technologies for two players for the case γ = 1/4 and c = 1.
We then show that for each segment, the suprimum ratio is obtained at an end point of the segment (a transition point).
Of the examples presented above, the AND, OR, and majority technologies were anonymous (but not AOO and OOA).
Proof sketch: We look at all transition points in both cases.
While in the AND technology we were able to fully  determine the POU analytically, the OR technology is more difficult to analyze.
A  technology (t, c) is anonymous if t is anonymous and the cost c is identical to all agents.
In this case the principal will make both agents exert effort whenever v ≥ 4.
< vn such that for any v s.t.
Thus, the optimal contract corresponds to the  maximum over a set of linear functions.
3.2 What Determines the Transitions?
Figure 3 shows the same phenomena for AND and OR technologies with 3 players.
Thus, we can focus on the  interval between the first and last transition points.
However, this is not true in general.
For any anonymous OR technology, there exist finite positive values v1 < v2 < .
Observation 2.
Substituting the transition point of the agency case into the POU expression yields the required expression.
