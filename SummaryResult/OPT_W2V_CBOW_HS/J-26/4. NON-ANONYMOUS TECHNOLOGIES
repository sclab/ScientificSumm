Observe that in the non-strategic case the k-orbit of any technology with identical cost c is of size at most 1 (as all sets of size k has the same cost, only the one with the maximal probability can be on the orbit).
Thus, the orbit of f is of size at most nl + 1, where nl is the number of agents in h. Part of the proof of the theorem (for the complete proof see [2]), is based on such AOO technology being a special case of a more general family of technologies, in which  disjoint anonymous technologies are And-ed together, as  explained in the next section.
A basic observation is that the orbit of a technology is actually an ordered list of sets of agents, where the order is determined by the following lemma.
Every admissible collection can be obtained as the k − orbit of some t. Proof sketch: The proof is constructive.
Thus, the orbit of any such technology in the non-strategic case is of size at most n + 1.
The first term is maximized at a set T that is optimal for h on the value g(R) · v, while the second term is independent of T and h. Thus, S is optimal for f on v if and only if T is an optimal contract for h on v · tg(R).
This completes the definition of t. We show that each admissible set S ∈ S is optimal at the value vS = ck 2 2 S .
If conjecture 2 is true, the same holds for the OOA technology.
We conclude that u(S1, v1) ≥ u(S2, v2), thus the utility is  monotonic non-decreasing in the value.
Does Lemma 7 hold also for the Boolean function f = g W h (i.e., when the networks g, h are taken in parallel)?
S ∈ S. Now we are left to show that at vS, the set S yields a higher utility than any other set Z ∈ S. The construction of t(Z) ensures this since the marginal contribution of each agent in Z is such a small , that the payment is too high for the set to be optimal.
Then the orbit of f = Vm j=1 gj is of size at most ( Pm j=1 nj ) − 1, where nj is the number of agents in technology gj (the orbit is linear in the number of agents).
By Lemma 5, T1 is optimal for h on v1 · g(R1), and T2 is optimal for h on v2 ·g(R2).
expected utility of the principal at the optimal contracts, the success probability of the optimal contracts, and the expected payment of the optimal contract, are all monotonically  nondecreasing with the value.
Let Q(S) denote the expected total payment to all agents in S in the case that the principal contracts with the set S and the project  succeeds (for the agency case, Q(S) = t(S) · P i∈S ci t(S)−t(S\i) , while for the non-strategic case Q(S) = P i∈S ci).
We then define the technology function t as follows: for any S ∈ S, t(S) = 1/2 − S and ∀i ∈ S, t(S \ i) = 1/2 − 2 S. Thus, the marginal contribution of every i ∈ S is S. Note that since S is admissible, t is well defined, as for any two sets S, S ∈ S and any two agents i, j, S \ i = S \ j.
By substituting these expressions and f(S) = h(T) · g(R), we derive that u(S, v) = h(T)  g(R) · v − P i∈T ci Δh i (T \i)  + g(R) · P i∈R ci Δ g i (R\i) .
As S2 is optimal at v2 and t(S1) ≥ t(S2), we observe that: t(S2) · v2 − Q(S2) ≥ t(S1) · v2 − Q(S1) ≥ t(S2) · v2 − Q(S1) or equivalently, Q(S2) ≤ Q(S1), which is what we wanted to show.
To ensure that an appropriate fraction of these code words have weight k, we construct a new code by XOR-ing each code word with a random word r. The properties of XOR ensure that the new code remains admissible.
S1 is optimal at v1, thus: t(S1) · v1 − Q(S1) ≥ t(S2) · v1 − Q(S2) S2 is optimal at v2, thus: t(S2) · v2 − Q(S2) ≥ t(S1) · v2 − Q(S1) Summing these two equations, we get that (t(S1) − t(S2)) · (v1 − v2) ≥ 0, which implies that if v1 > v2 than t(S1) ≥ t(S2).
As S1 is optimal at v1, u(S1, v1) ≥ u(S2, v1), and as t(S2) ≥ 0 and v1 > v2, u(S2, v1) ≥ u(S2, v2).
( Monotonicity lemma) For any technology (t, c), in both the agency and the non-strategic cases, the 9 This implies that there are no two sets with the same  success probability in the orbit.
In this section, we identify the sets of agents that can be obtained as the optimal contract for some v. These sets construct the orbit of a technology.
Similarly, we show that R is an optimal contract for g on v · th(T).
The  korbit of t is the collection of sets of size exactly k in the orbit.
2 For k = n/2 we can construct an exponential size  admissible collection, which by Theorem 4 can be used to build a technology with exponential size orbit.
The real function v → th(T), where T is the h − part of an optimal contract for f on v, is monotone non-decreasing (and similarly for the function v → tg(R)).
We first show that it is better than any other S ∈ S. At the value vS = ck 2 2 S , the set S that  corresponds to S maximizes the utility of the principal.
Let h be an anonymous OR technology, and let f = Vnc j=1 h be the AOO technology that is obtained by a conjunction of nc of these OR-components on disjoint  inputs.
This result is obtained by taking the derivative of u(S, v).
As v1 > v2 and g(R1) > g(R2), T1 is optimal for h on a larger value than T2, thus by Lemma 3, h(T1) ≥ h(T2), a contradiction.
Assume that {(gj, cj )}m j=1 is a set of  anonymous technologies on disjoint inputs, each with identical agent cost (all agents of technology gj has the same cost cj).
In an OOA technology which is a  disjunction of the same anonymous paths (with the same  number of agents, γ and c, but over disjoint inputs), for any value v the optimal contract is constructed from some  number of fully-contracted paths.
Suppose the sets of agents S1 and S2 are  optimal in v1 and v2 < v1, respectively.
We make the first step towards a solution of this question by showing that the size of the orbit of a conjunction of two disjoint networks (taking the two in a serial) is at most the sum of the two networks" orbit sizes.
In case of identical costs, it is impossible for all subsets of agents to be on the orbit.
25 4.2 Orbit Characterization The AOO is an example of a technology whose orbit size is linear in its number of agents.
Let S be an optimal contract for f = g V h on v. Then, T is an optimal contract for h on v · tg(R), and R is an optimal contract for g on v · th(T).
The optimal contract for f for some v, denoted by S, is composed of some agents from the h-part and some from the g-part, call them T and R respectively.
Let g and h be two Boolean functions on  disjoint inputs and let f = g V h (i.e., take their networks in series).
In particular, this holds for AOO technology where each OR-component is anonymous.
Let Δf i (S \ i) denote the marginal contribution of agent i ∈ S. Then, for any i ∈ T, Δf i (S \ i) = g(R) · Δh i (T \ i), and for any i ∈ R, Δf i (S \ i) = h(T) · Δg i (R \ i).
Let S1 = T1 ∪ R1 be the optimal contract for f on v1, and let S2 = T2 ∪R2 be the optimal contract for f on v2 < v1.
For a technology t, a set of agents S is in the orbit of t if for some value v, the optimal contract is exactly with the set S of agents (where ties between different S"s are broken according to a lexicographic order9 ).
Then for any value v, an optimal contract contracts with the same number of agents in each OR-component.
Nevertheless, we next show that the orbit can have exponential size.
We are unable to prove it in general, but can prove it for the case of an OOA technology with two paths of length two (see [2]).
We conjecture that a similar result holds for the OOA technology.
Let g and h be two Boolean functions on disjoint inputs and let f = g V h (i.e., take their networks in series).
Therefore S yields a higher utility than any other S ∈ S. We also pick the range of S to ensure that at vS, S is better than any other set S \ i s.t.
Proof sketch: We exress the pricipal"s utility u(S, v) from contracting with the set S when his value is v. We abuse notation and use the function to denote the technology as well.
If this is true, this will show that series-parallel networks have polynomial size orbit. 
This holds by the observation that the 1-orbit (a single agent that exerts effort) is of size at most 1.
We conjecture that this is indeed the case, and that the corresponding Lemmas 5 and 7 exist for the OR case as well.
Suppose x and y are the respective orbit sizes of g and h; then, the orbit size of f is less or equal to x + y − 1.
Assume in contradiction that h(T1) < h(T2), then since h(T1)·g(R1) ≥ h(T2)·g(R2) this implies that g(R1) > g(R2).
By induction we get the following corollary.
Next we show that the success probability is monotonic non-decreasing in the value.
For any n ≥ k, there exists an admissible  collection of k-size sets of size Ω( 1 n · `n k ´ ).
There exists a technology (t, c) with orbit of size Ω( 2n n √ n ).
For any other set Z, we define t(Z) in a way that ensures that the marginal contribution of each agent in Z is a very small (the technical details appear in the full version).
Let S be some admissible collection of k-size sets.
By Lemma 3 f(S1) ≥ f(S2), and since f = g · h, f(S1) = h(T1) · g(R1) ≥ h(T2) · g(R2) = f(S2).
Nevertheless, so far, we have not seen examples of  seriesparallel networks whose orbit size is larger than n + 1.
Finally we show that the expected payment is monotonic non-decreasing in the value.
We next show that there exist very large admissible collections.
< vnl such that for any v, vi ≤ v ≤ vi+1, exactly i paths are contracted.
2 In [2] we present the full proof of the theorem, as well as the full proofs of all other claims presented in this section without such a proof.
In non-anonymous technologies (even with identical costs), we need to talk about the contracted set of agents and not only about the number of contracted agents.
The  principal"s utility is a linear function of the value, u(S, v) = t(S)·v−Q(S).
Is there a structured technology with  exponential orbit?
Thus the expected number of weight k words is Ω( `n k ´ /n), and for some r this expectation is achieved or exceeded.
For the full proof, see [2].
What can be said about the orbit size of a general non-anonymous technology?
We show that the picture in the agency case is very different.
How big can the orbit size of a  seriesparallel network be?
A collection of sets of k elements (out of n) is  admissible, if every two sets in the collection differ by at least 2 elements (e.g.
Such a code has a distance ≥ 3, thus admissible.
Is there a Read Once network with exponential orbit?
The AOO technology (see figure 2) is composed of  multiple OR-components that are Anded together.
Thus, we are able to construct a technology with  exponential orbit, but this technology is not a network technology or a structured technology.
Only the agent that gives the highest success probability (when only he exerts effort) can be on the orbit (as he also needs to be paid the least).
For each set S ∈ S in the collection we pick S, such that for any two admissible sets Si = Sj, Si = Sj .
Corollary 2.
Proof sketch: The proof is based on an error correcting code that corrects one bit.
Corollary 1.
Each code word is now uniformly mapped to the whole cube, and thus its probability of having weight k is `n k ´ /2n .
4.1 AOO and OOA Technologies We begin our discussion of non-anonymous technologies with two examples; the And-of-Ors (AOO) and Or-of-Ands (OOA) technologies.
Moreover, there exist v1 < .
It would also be interesting to consider a disjunction of two Boolean functions.
26 Based on Lemma 5 and Lemma 6, we obtain the following Lemma.
It is known that there are such codes with Ω(2n /n) code words.
