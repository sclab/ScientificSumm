Given as input a black box for a success function t (when the costs are identical), and a value v, the number of queries that is needed, in the worst case, to find the optimal contract is exponential in n. Proof.
Once we have the orbit, it is clear that an optimal contract for any given value v can be calculated.
By choosing γx close enough to 1 2 , we can make sure that player x will enter the optimal contract only for very large values of v, after all other agents are contracted (if we can find the optimal contract for any value, it is easy to find a value for which in the original network the optimal contract is E, by keep doubling the value and asking for the optimal contract.
The critical value of v where player x enters the optimal contract of G , can be found using binary search over the algorithm that supposedly finds the optimal contract for any network and any value.
Thus the problem we address will be: The Optimal Contract Problem for Read Once  Networks: Input: A read-once network G = (V, E), with two specific vertices s, t; rational values γe, δe for each player e ∈ E (and ce = 1), and a rational value v. Output: A set S of agents who should be contracted in an optimal contract.
We go over all sets T such that t(T) > t(S), and  calculate the value for which the principal is indifferent between contracting with T and contracting with S. The minimal  indifference value is the next transition point and the contract that has the minimal indifference value is the next optimal contract.
, tn and the identical cost c for an anonymous technology, or the value t(S) for all the 2n possible subsets S ⊆ N of the players, and a vector of costs c for non-anonymous technologies), the following can all be computed in polynomial time: • The orbit of the technology in both the agency and the non-strategic cases.
A possible candidate for the first direction is the family of series-parallel networks, for which the network reliability problem (computing the value of t) is polynomial.
We conclude that ` n n/2 ´ − 1 queries are needed to determine the optimal contract, and this is exponential in n. 27 5.2 Structured Technologies In this section we will consider the natural representation of read-once networks for the underlying Boolean function.
Given an instance of a network reliability problem < G, {ζe}e∈E > (where ζe denotes e"s probability of success), we define an instance of the optimal contract problem as follows: first define a new graph G which is obtained by Anding G with a new player x, with γx very close to 1 2 and δx = 1 − γx.
In conclusion, computing the optimal contract in general is hard.
For each set of agents ˆT of size k, the technology t ˆT is defined by t( ˆT) = 1 − (n − | ˆT|) · and t(T) = |T| · for any T = ˆT of size k. For the value v = c·(k + 1/2), the optimal contract for t ˆT is ˆT (for the contract ˆT the utility of the principal is about v −c·k = 1/2·c > 0, while for any other contract the utility is negative).
t(E) · γx · v − X i∈E c γx · Δt i(E \ i) !
5.1 Binary-Outcome Binary-Action  Technologies Here we assume that we are given a technology and value v as the input, and our output should be the optimal  contract, i.e.
A more interesting question is whether if given the  function t as a black box, we can compute the optimal contract in time that is polynomial in n. We can show that, in general this is not the case: Theorem 5.
We first consider the general model where the  technology function is given by an arbitrary monotone function t (with rational values), and we then consider the case of structured technologies given by a network representation of the underlying Boolean function.
The first avenue is to study families of technologies whose optimal contracts can be computed in polynomial time.
Assume that we have calculated the optimal contracts and the transition points up to some transition point v for which S is an optimal contract with the highest success probability.
if and only if t(E) = (1 − γx) · c (βx)2 · v thus, if we can always find the optimal contract we are also able to compute the value of t(E).
The Optimal Contract Problem for Read Once Networks is #P-hard (under Turing reductions).
In the general case, the success function t is of size exponential in n, the number of agents, and we will need to deal with that.
Finally, as we can calculate the orbit of the technology in both the agency and the non-strategic cases in polynomial time, we can find the price of unaccountability in polynomial time.
By Lemma 3 the next contract on the orbit (for higher  values) has a higher success probability (there are no two sets with the same success probability on the orbit).
Given a Read Once AND-of-OR network such that each OR-component is an anonymous technology, the optimal contract problem can be solved in polynomial time.
The empty contract is always optimal for v = 0.
= t(E)(1 − γx) v − X i∈E c (1 − γx) · Δt i(E \ i) − c t(E) · βx !
To construct the orbit we find all transition points and the sets that are in the orbit.
If the algorithm queries about at most ` n n/2 ´ − 2 sets of size k, then it cannot always determine the optimal  contract (as any of the sets that it has not queried about might be the optimal one).
, tn, and in this case our analysis in section 3 completely suffices for computing the optimal contract.
Clearly the above calculation is polynomial in the input size.
Linearity of the utility in the value and  monotonicity of the success probability of the optimal contracts ensure that the above works.
We find the largest transition point that is not larger than the value v, and the optimal contract at v is the set with the higher success probability at this transition point.
We first notice that even  computing the value t(E) is a hard problem: it is called the network reliability problem and is known to be #P − hard [8].
• An optimal contract for any given value v, for both the agency and the non-strategic cases.
For the other edges, we let δe = ζe and γe = ζe/2.
By Lemma 1 the price of unaccountability POU(t) is obtained at some transition point, so we only need to go over all transition points, and find the one with the maximal social welfare ratio.
For some small > 0 and k = n/2 we define the success probability for a given set T as follows.
Can the optimal contract problem for Read Once series-parallel networks be solved in polynomial time?
Once we find such a value, we choose γx s.t.
We first show how to construct the orbit of the technology (the same procedure apply in both cases).
The second avenue is to explore approximation  algorithms for the optimal contract problem.
We prove the claims for the non-anonymous case, the proof for the anonymous case is similar.
We show how to calculate the next transition point and the next optimal contract.
We  calculate the next optimal contract by the following procedure.
Consider the following family of technologies.
Given as input the full description of a technology (the values t0, .
• The price of unaccountability POU(t, c).
We will show that an algorithm for this problem can be used to solve the network reliability problem.
the set S∗ of agents to be contracted and the contract pi for each i ∈ S∗ .
In the special case of anonymous technologies, the description of t is only the n+1 numbers t0, .
Our analysis throughout the paper sheds some light on the algorithmic aspects of computing the best contract.
In this section we state these implications (for the proofs see [2]).
Now when we write the expression for this indifference, in terms of t(E) and Δt i(E) , we observe the following.
Just a little effort will reveal that our problem is not easier: Theorem 6.
Note that at this critical value v, the principal is indifferent between the set E and E ∪ {x}.
We can only handle the non-trivial level of AOO networks: Lemma 8.
Let t(E) denote the probability of success when each edge succeeds with probability δe.
c 1−2γx is larger than that value).
If |T| < k, then t(T) = |T| · .
If |T| > k, then t(T) = 1 − (n − |T|) · .
Let us denote βx = 1 − 2γx.
These results suggest two natural research  directions.
