Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten recognition and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled. 
In this paper, we consider the image retrieval problem on a small, static, and closed-domain image data.
Using techniques from experimental  design, our algorithm finds the most informative images to label.
This paper describes a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design, to enable more effective relevance feedback image retrieval.
The  experimental results on Corel database show that both active learning and semi-supervised learning can significantly improve the retrieval performance.
These labeled images and the unlabeled images in the database are used to learn a classifier.
For Web image search, it is possible to collect a large amount of user click information.
This information can be naturally used to construct the affinity graph in our algorithm.
A much more challenging domain is the World Wide Web (WWW).
Our algorithm is based on an objective function which simultaneously minimizes the empirical error and preserves the local geometrical structure of the data space.
However, the computational complexity in Web scenario may  become a crucial issue.
