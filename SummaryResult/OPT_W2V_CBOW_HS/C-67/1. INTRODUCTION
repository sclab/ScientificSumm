In addition, the computers comprising the grid need not be dedicated to the grid; rather, they can function as normal workstations, and then advertise their availability to the grid when not in use.
In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.
Distributed computing can also be more fine-grained, where even a single application is broken into parts and each part located on different machines: a word processor on one server, a spell checker on a second server, etc.
The processing power of any machine added to the grid is immediately availably for solving problems.
Clustered machines are generally in spatial proximity, such as in the same server room, and dedicated solely to their task.
Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the similarities and difference between these computing models so that grid computing can be placed in perspective.
1.1 Clustering A cluster is a group of machines in a fixed configuration united to operate and be managed as a single entity to increase robustness and performance.
The grid members are not necessarily in proximity, but must merely be accessible over a network; the grid can access computers on a LAN, WAN, or anywhere in the world via the Internet.
1.5 Comparing the Grid and Cluster A computer grid expands the capabilities of the cluster by loosing its spatial bounds, so that any computer accessible through the network gains the potential to augment the grid.
A simple example is spreading services such as file and print serving, web serving, and data storage across multiple machines rather than a single machine handling all the tasks.
1.2 Distributed Computing Distributed computing spatially expands network services so that the components providing the services are separated.
The important thing to note is that resources are only used as needed, and not dedicated to a single customer.
Although numerous distributed computing models were available for discipline-specific scientific applications, only recently have the tools became available to use general-purpose applications on a grid.
In addition, the machines on the grid can be  generalpurpose workstations, which keep down the cost of expanding the grid. 
A well-known example of such an ad hoc grid is the SETI@home project [2] of the University of California at Berkeley, which allows any person in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to donate unused processor time for analyzing radio telescope data.
A service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to a customer as needed, and charges for usage rather than a flat rate.
A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.
Its roots lie in early distributed computing models that date back to early 1980s, where scientists harnessed the computing power of idle workstations to let compute intensive applications to run on multiple workstations, which dramatically shortening processing times.
The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.
The cluster appears as a single high-speed system or a single highly available system.
In a high-availability cluster, each machine provides the same service.
Should one web server "die," another provides the service, so that the web site rarely, if ever, goes down.
An example of a parallel cluster is composed of Apple Power Mac G5 computers at Virginia Tech University [1].
Problems are split into many parts, and individual cluster members are given part of the problem to solve.
The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.
In this model, resources can not enter and leave the group as necessary.
1.4 Grid Computing Grid computing contains aspects of clusters, distributed computing, and utility computing.
For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.
The technology behind grid computing model is not new.
Consequently, the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of "utility computing".
A parallel cluster is a type of supercomputer.
If one machine fails, another seamlessly takes over its workload.
Grid computing does not have a single, universally accepted definition.
There are at least two types of clusters: parallel clusters and  highavailability clusters.
1.3 Utility Computing Literally, utility computing resembles common utilities such as telephone or electric service.
