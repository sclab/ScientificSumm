We can then interpret our formulae in an SWF F over K, a preference profile L ∈ L(K) and a pair (a, b) ⊆ K × K, a b, as follows: F, L, (a, b) |=swf φ ⇔ fF , γL , aPb |=LK φ where γL is the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile L. While in the general judgment aggregation case a formula is  interpreted in the context of an agenda item, in the preference  aggregation case a formula is thus interpreted in the context of a pair of alternatives.
When this formula is interpreted as a statement about a social welfare function, it says that there exists a preference profile such that for all pairs (a, b) of alternatives, b is preferred over a in the aggregation (by the SWF) of the preference profile if and only if agent i prefers b over a.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 571 • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf (1 ∧ 2) (agents 1 and 2 can choose their preferences such that they will agree on some pair of alternatives) • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf σ ↔ G⊆{1,2,3},|G|≥2 i∈G i (the SWF Fmaj implements pair-wise majority voting) As usual, we write F |=swf φ when F, L, (a, b) |=swf φ for any L and (a, b), and so on.
While we have |=swf i, for other agendas there are underlying logics L such that |=L i To see the latter, take an agenda with a formula p which is  inconsistent in the underlying logic L - p can never be included in a judgment set.
Thus, F |=swf MT2, for any SWF F. We now have everything we need to express Arrow"s statement as a formula.
|=swf i → ¬i - given an alternative b which is preferred over some other  alternative a by agent i, there is some other pair of alternatives c and d such that d is not preferred over c - namely (c, d) = (b, a).
For the direction to the left, let F |=swf MT2.
This means that the formula is a member of L(Σ, AK ) for any set of alternatives K, and is valid no matter which set of alternatives we assume.
Follows immediately from Theorem 3 and the fact that for any JAR f, there is a SWF F such that f = fF .
F |=swf ND iff F has the property ND2 F |=swf IND iff F has the property IIA F |=swf UNA iff F has the property PO The properties expressed above are properties of SWFs.
Since PO is a SWF property, this means that F, L, (a, b) |=swf PO (satisfaction of PO is independent of L, a, b), and thus that F, L, (a, b) |=swf ¬PO ∨ ¬ND ∨ ¬IIA.
The preference aggregation correspondent to the  discursive paradox of judgment aggregation is the well known  Condorcet"s voting paradox, stating that pair-wise majority voting can lead to aggregated preferences which are cyclic (even if the  individual preferences are not).
But that is not possible if |K| = 2, because if K = {a, b} then AK = {aPb, ¬aPb, bPa, ¬bPa} and thus it is impossible that γ1 ⊆ AK since we cannot have aPb, bPa ∈ γ1.

From (ii) and (iv) we get that (a1 , b1 ) (a2 , b2 ), and from that and (i) and (iii) it follows that γ1 contains two different pairs a1 Pb1 and a2 Pb2 each having two different elements.
Thus, there is a γ such that there exists (a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 ) ∈ K × K, where a1 b1 , and a2 b2 , such that (i) a1 Pb1 ∈ γ1, (ii) a1 Pb1 ∈ γ2, (iii) a2 Pb2 ∈ γ1 and (iv) a2 Pb2 γ2.
|=swf ( (i ∨ j) → (i ∧ ¬j)) - if, given preferences of agents and a SWF, for any two alternatives it is always the case that either agent i or agent j prefers the second alternative over the first, then there must exist a pair of alternatives for which the two agents disagree.
Note that the formula in Theorem 4 does not mention any agenda items (i.e., pairs of alternatives) such as haPb directly in an  expression.
We have the following: • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf 1 ∧ 2 ∧ 3 (all agents agree, under the individual rankings L, on the relative ranking of m and  dthey agree that d is better than m) • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf ¬(1 ↔ 2) (under the individual  rankings L, there is some pair of alternatives on which agents 1 and 2 disagree) The Sixth Intl.
If the set of alternatives K is finite, we have that for any formula ψ ∈ L(Σ, AK ), JAL(LK ) ψ iff |=swf ψ.
For the direction to the right, let |K| > 2; let a, b, c be three distinct elements of K. Let γ1 be the judgment set corresponding to the ranking abc and γ2 the judgment set corresponding to acb.
There exists some preference profile in which agent i prefers b over a. Technically speaking, the formula i holds in SWFs because the agenda AK does not contain a formula which (alone) is inconsistent wrt.
For example, F, L, (a, b) |=swf MT2 iff F |= MT2, for any F, L, a, b.
The formula MV which in the general judgment aggregation case expresses proposition-wise majority voting, expresses in the  preference aggregation case pair-wise majority voting, as illustrated in Example 2.
By Proposition 2, F |=swf PO.
6.2 Axiomatisation and Logical Properties We immediately get, from Theorem 3, a sound and complete axiomatisation of preference aggregation over a finite set of  alternatives.
, An) = A, where A is the consistent and complete judgment set corresponding to F(L1, .
A justification is that no single agent can prefer the second alternative over the first for every pair of alternatives, so in this case if i prefers b over a then j must prefer a over b.
So, for example, Arrow"s theorem is provable in jal(LK ): JAL(LK ) MT2 → ¬(PO ∧ ND ∧ IIA).
Note that MT2, PO, ND and IIA are true SWF properties, their truth value wrt.
Let F ∈ F (K), and F, L, (a, b) |=swf MT2 for some L and a, b.
Depending on the agenda, SWFs may have additional properties, induced by the logic LK , which are not always shared by JARs with other underlying logics.
Every formula which is valid with respect to judgment  aggregation rules is also valid with respect to social welfare functions, so all general logical properties of JARs are also properties of SWFs.
Their individual preferences are illustrated on the right in Table 1 in Section 3, along with the result of a SWF Fmaj implementing pair-wise majority voting.
By Arrow"s  theorem, F cannot have all the properties PO, ND2 and IIA.
But that is impossible, since by transitivity we would also have that (a, c) ∈ F(X) which  contradicts the fact that F(X) is antisymmetric.
, Ln) where Li is the preference relation corresponding to the consistent and complete judgment set Ai.
Now, for any aggregation rule f, f, γ, aPb |= 1 ∧ 2 and f, γ, bPc |= 1 ∧ ¬2.
It follows from his theorem that the formula is valid on the class of all social welfare functions.
Let L = mdc, mcd, cmd be the preference profile corresponding to the preferences in the example.
Take the formula (i ↔ σ).
Again, this property does not necessarily hold for other agendas, because the agenda might contain an inconsistency the agents could not possibly disagree upon.
We have that fF , γ , aPb |=LK 1 ∧ 2 and, since fF , γ , aPb |=LK MV, we have that fF , γ , aPb |=LK σ and thus that aPb ∈ fF (γ ) and (a, b) ∈ F(X).
Given a set K of alternatives, [5] defines a simple predicate logic LK with language L(LK ) as follows: • L(LK ) has one constant a for each alternative a ∈ K,  variables v1, v2, .
We can express Condorcet"s paradox as follows, again as a universally valid logical property of SWFs.
|=swf MT2 → ¬MV, when there are at least three agents.
|=swf MT2 → ¬(PO ∧ ND ∧ IIA) Proof.
Take the logical language L(Σ, AK ), for some set of agents Σ, and take the underlying logic to be LK .
W.l.o.g assume that F does not have the PO property.
Let us now look at properties of the set of alternatives K we can express.
Let fF , γ, aPb |=LK MT2; there are thus three distinct  elements a, b, c ∈ K. Assume that fF , γ, aPb |=LK MV.
Let γ be the judgment profile corresponding to the preference  profile X = (abc, cab, bca).
To see the former, take an arbitrary pair of  alternatives (a, b).
Properties involving cardinality is often of interest, for example in Arrow"s theorem.
In a similar manner we get that (c, a) ∈ F(X) and (b, c) ∈ F(X).
Proposition 2.
Thus we can use jal to reason about preference aggregation as follows.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) - for any pair of alternatives (a, b), any possible combination of the relative ranking of a and b among the agents is possible.
|K| > 2 iff F |=swf MT2.
Thus, our formulae can be seen as expressing properties of social welfare functions.
By Proposition 3, K has more than two alternatives.
|=swf o∈O o 572 The Sixth Intl.
The proof is similar to the proof of the discursive  paradox.
By the same reason, the following properties also hold in SWFs but not in JARs in general.
Thus, it follows that fF , γ, aPb |=LK MV.
One such property is i.
Recently, Dietrich and List [5] showed that preference  aggregation can be embedded in judgment aggregation.
In this section we show that our judgment aggregation logic also can be used to  reason about preference aggregation.
Proposition 4.
Proof theoretically, these additional properties of SWFs are  derived using the Closure rule. 
Let F ∈ F (K).
6.1 Expressivity Examples We make precise the claim in Section 2.2 that the three  mentioned SWF properties correspond to the three mentioned JAR  properties, respectively.
