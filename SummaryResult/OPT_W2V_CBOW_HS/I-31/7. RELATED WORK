However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper.
Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.
A notable and recent exception is a logical framework for  judgment aggregation developed by Marc Pauly in [10], in order to be able to characterise the logical relationships between different  judgment aggregation rules.
This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying structure to represent individual and collective  preferences.
Formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated preferences for a given representation [6, 7, 8].
In the preference aggregation logic jal(LK ) we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen as arrows.
The modal logic arrow logic [11] is designed to reason about any object that can be graphically represented as an arrow, and has  various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships between these arrows.
Nevertheless, the relationship to arrow logic could be investigated further in future work.
While the motivation is similar to the work in this paper, the approaches are fundamentally different: in [10], the possible results from applying a rule to some judgment  profile are taken as primary and described axiomatically; in our  approach the aggregation rule and its possible inputs, i.e., judgment profiles, are taken as primary and described axiomatically.
The two approaches do not seem to be directly related to each other in the sense that one can be embedded in the other.
In  particular, arrow logics are usually proven complete wrt.
Then, changing the preference profile takes us from one algebra to another, and a SWF determines the collective preference, in each of the algebras. 
an algebra.
