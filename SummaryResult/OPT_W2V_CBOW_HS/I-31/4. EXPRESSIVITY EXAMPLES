Because f, γ, p |=L 1 ∧ 2, it follows that f, γ, p |=L σ.
, An) ⇔ |{i : p ∈ Ai}| > |{i : p Ai}| f |= MV exactly iff f has the above property for all judgment  profiles and propositions.
4.1 The Discursive Paradox As illustrated in Example 1, the following formula expresses proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p MV = σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i (4) i.e., the following property of a JAR f and admissible profile A1, .
Since f(γ) is complete, ¬q ∈ f(γ).
In a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=L σ and f, γ, q |=L ¬σ.
Independence can be expressed as follows: IND = o∈O ((o ∧ σ) → (o → σ)) (2) Lemma 2. f |=L IND iff f has the property IND.
and there exists an aggregation rule f over A such that f |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i).
We have that f, γ, p |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i) for any p , so f, γ, p |=L σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i.
Non-dictatorship can be expressed as follows: ND = i∈Σ ¬(σ ↔ i) (1) Lemma 1. f |=L ND iff f has the property ND1.
Proposition 1 is a logical statement of a variant of the well-known discursive dilemma: if three agents are voting on propositions p, q and p → q, proposition-wise majority voting might not yield a consistent result. 
}, A2 = {p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, .
Unanimity can be expressed as follows: UNA = ((1 ∧ · · · ∧ n) → σ) (3) Lemma 3. f |=L UNA iff f has the property UNA.
Assume the opposite, e.g., that A = {p, p → q, q, ¬p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, .
and A3 = {¬p, p → q, ¬q, .
In other words, p ∈ f(γ), p → q ∈ f(γ) and q f(γ).
, An : p ∈ f(A1, .
Assume that the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication (i.e., A contains p, q, p → q for some p, q ∈ L(L)).
Let γ be the  judgment profile γ = A1, A2, A3 where A1 = {p, p → q, q, .
Proposition 1 (Discursive Paradox).
But that contradicts the fact that f(γ) is required to be consistent.
|=L (( MV) → ⊥) when there are at least three agents and the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication.
However, we have the following in our logic.
