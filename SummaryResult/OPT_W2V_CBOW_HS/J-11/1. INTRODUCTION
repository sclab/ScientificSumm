But it is not a good model to use to examine where prices come from or exactly how buyers and sellers and trade with each other.
Our results will identify general forms of some of the principles noted in the examples discussed above - including the question of which buyers end up with the good; the question of how payoffs are differently realized by sellers, traders, and  buyers; and the question of what structural properties of the network determine whether the traders will make positive profits.
The previous example shows perhaps the most natural way in which a trader"s profit on a particular transaction can drop to 0: when there is another trader who can replicate its function  precisely.
The bid and ask prices shown are consistent with an equilibrium in which i1 and j1 accept the  offers of trader t1, and no other buyer accepts the offer of its adjacent trader: thus, trader t1 receives the good with a bid price of x, and makes w − x by selling the good to buyer j1 for w. In this way, we can consider this particular instance as an auction for a single good in which the traders act as proxies for their adjacent buyers.
If a particular trader t finds that more buyers than sellers accept its offers, then it has committed to provide more copies of the good than it has received, and we will say that this results in a large penalty to the trader for defaulting; the effect of this is that in equilibrium, no trader will choose bid and ask prices that result in a default.
Of course, if one specifies pairwise valuations on buyers but just single valuations for sellers, we model a setting where buyers can distinguish among the goods, but sellers don"t care whom they sell to - this (roughly) captures settings like housing markets.
On the other hand, the other sellers and buyers experience the downsides of monopoly - they receive 0 payoff since they have only a single option for trade, and the corresponding trader makes all the profit.
In fact, we can show how the basic model of Kranton and Minehart can be encoded as an instance of our game, with traders producing prices at equilibrium matching the prices produced by their auction mechanism.1 Finally, the classic results of Shapley and Shubik [13] on the assignment game can be viewed as studying the result of trade on a bipartite graph in terms of the core.
Our goal in  formulating the model is to express the process of price-setting in  markets such as those discussed above, where the participants do not all have uniform access to one another.
At a general level, our approach can be viewed as synthesizing two important strands of work: one that treats buyer-seller interaction using  network structures, but without attempting to model the processses by which prices are actually formed [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13]; and another strand in the literature on market microstructure that  incorporates price-setting intermediaries, but without network-type constraints on who can trade with whom [12].
By developing a  network model that explicitly includes traders as price-setting agents, in a system together with buyers and sellers, we are able to capture price formation in a network setting as a strategic process carried out by intermediaries, rather than as the result of a centrally  controlled or exogenous mechanism.
Buyers and sellers each have a value for one copy of the good, and we assume that these values are common knowledge.
The traders serve as intermediaries in a two-stage trading game: they strategically choose bid and ask prices to offer to the sellers and buyers they are connected to; the sellers and buyers then react to the prices they face.
Each agent has an initial endowment of money that is larger than any individual  valuation θi; the effect of this is to guarantee that any buyer who ends up without a copy of the good has been priced out of the market due to its valuation and network position, not a lack of funds.
In this literature there are agents who set prices, but the fiction of a single market is maintained.
A strategy for a trader now consists of offering a bid to each seller that specifies both a price and a buyer, and  offering an ask to each buyer that specifies both a price and a seller.
Note further how this natural behavior emerges from the fact that traders are able to offer different prices to different agents - capturing the fact that there is no one fixed price in the kinds of markets that motivate the model, but rather different prices reflecting the relative power of the different agents involved.
One example of this setting is the trade of agricultural goods in developing countries.
In the finance literature the work on market microstructure does have price-setting agents (specialists), parts of it do determine  separate bid and ask prices, and different agents receive different prices for the same asset (see [12] for a treatment of microstructure  theory).
In the most basic version of the model, we consider identical goods, one copy of which is initially held by each seller.
And indeed, in every equilibrium, there is a real number x ∈ [0, 1] such that both traders offer bid and ask prices of x to i2 and j2 respectively, while they offer bids of 0 and asks of 1 to the other sellers and buyers.
However, we are able to characterize the maximum and minimum amounts that a given trader is able to make, where these maxima and minima are taken over all equilibria, and we give an efficient algorithm to compute this.
In particular, our results here imply a clean combinatorial characterization of when a given trader t can achieve non-zero  payoff: this occurs if and only there is some edge e incident to t that is essential, in the sense that deleting e reduces the value of the  optimal allocation θ∗ .
For many assets there is no one market; trade in a single asset may occur simultaneously on the floor of an exchange, on crossing networks, on electronic exchanges, and in markets in other  countries.
buyer valuations are the same numerically.
Instead of having each agent i ∈ B ∪ S have a single numerical valuation θi, we index valuations by pairs of buyers and sellers: if buyer j obtains the good initially held by seller i, it gets a utility of θji, and if seller i sells its good to buyer j, it experiences a loss of utility of θij .
We establish the existence and efficiency of equilibria by constructing a linear program to capture the flow of goods through the network; the dual of this linear program contains enough  information to extract equilibrium prices.
Any outcome of the game determines a final allocation of goods to some of the agents; this can be specified by a collection M of triples (ie, te, je), where ie ∈ S, te ∈ T, and je ∈ B; moreover, each seller and each buyer appears in at most one triple.
To keep the figures from getting too cluttered, we adopt the following  conventions: sellers are drawn as circles in the leftmost column and will be named i1, i2, .
All edges have one end in B ∪ S and the other in T; that is, each edge has the form (i, t) for i ∈ S and t ∈ T, or (j, t) for j ∈ B and t ∈ T. This reflects the constraints that all buyer-seller transactions go through traders as intermediaries.
In Figure 1(b), we show how nodes with different positions in the network topology can achieve different payoffs, even when all 144 w x y z x w x x y y z z (a) Auction 1 1 1 0 x x 0 1 x x 1 (b) Heterogeneous outcomes 1 1 1 0 x x 0 1 x x 1 (c) Implicit perfect competition Figure 1: (a) An auction, mediated by traders, in which the buyer with the highest valuation for the good ends up with it.
Thus in this simple model, all buyers and sellers are uniform and trade at the same price, and there is also no role for intermediaries.
By the definition of the game, the value of the equilibrium  allocation is divided up as payoffs to the agents, and it is interesting to ask how this value is distributed - in particular how much profit a trader is able to make based on its position in the network.
Here a monopolist, or a group of oliogopolists, choose prices in order to maximize their profits (see [14] for the standard textbook treatment of these markets).
In many settings there is also a gap between the price a buyer pays for an asset, the ask price, and the price a seller receives for the asset, the bid price.
(We can also handle a model in which a trader may choose not to make an offer to certain of its adjacent sellers or buyers.)
The difficulty is that in the Walrasian model there is no agent who sets the price, and agents don"t actually trade with each other.
In a range of settings where markets mediate the interactions of buyers and sellers, one observes several recurring properties:  Individual buyers and sellers often trade through intermediaries, not all buyers and sellers have access to the same intermediaries, and not all buyers and sellers trade at the same price.
Having different buyer valuations captures settings like house purchases; adding different seller valuations as well captures matching  markets - for example, sellers as job applicants and buyers as  employers, with both caring about who ends up with which good (and with traders acting as services that broker the job search).
Their auction has desirable equilibrium properties but as Kranton and Minehart note it is an abstraction of how goods are allocated and prices are determined that is similar in spirit to the Walrasian auctioneer abstraction.
More precisely, a strategy for each trader t is a specification of a bid price βti for each seller i to which t is connected, and an ask price αtj for each buyer j to which t is connected.
The particular way in which goods flow is determined by the following game.
One of the most striking examples of this phenomenon occurs in the market for foreign  exchange, where there is an interbank market with restricted access and a retail market with much more open access.
We find that, although all equilibria have the same value, a given trader"s payoff can vary across different equilibria.
Rather, price-setting is part of the strategic outcome, as in the real markets that motivate our work, and our equilibria are simultaneously budget-balanced and efficient - something not possible in the mechanism design frameworks that have been used.
But again there are no price-setting agents here.
In fact there is no market, in the everyday sense of that word, in the Walrasian model.
We will subsequently generalize this to a setting in which goods are distinguishable,  buyers can value different goods differently, and potentially sellers can value transactions with different buyers differently as well.
, jb, the payoff is P r αtjr − P r βtir ,  minus a penalty π if b > s. The penalty is chosen to be large enough that a trader will never incur it in equilibrium, and hence we will generally not be concerned with the penalty.
Thus,  equilibria in this model are always efficient, in that the market enables the right set of people to get the good, subject to the network  constraints.
First, each trader offers a bid price to each seller it is connected to, and an ask price to each buyer it is connected to.
Thus, to start with the basic model, there is a single type of good; the good comes in individisible units; and each seller initially holds one unit of the good.
We also  analyze how trader profits depend on the network structure, essentially characterizing in graph-theoretic terms how a trader"s payoff is  determined by the amount of competition it experiences with other traders.
Some buyers and sellers have access to many or all of these trading venues; others have access to only one or a few of them.
The price spreads have been driven to zero by a global constraint imposed by the long cycle through all the agents; this is an example of implicit perfect competition determined by the network topology.
All sellers in the examples will have valuations for the good equal to 0; the valuation of each buyer is drawn inside its circle; and the bid or ask price on each edge is drawn on top of the edge.
We also obtain results for the sum of all trader profits.
We show that every instance of our game has an equilibrium, and that in every such equilibrium, the allocation has value θ∗  145 in other words, it achieves the best value possible.
from top to bottom; and buyers are drawn as circles in the rightmost column and will be named j1, j2, .
In briefly reviewing this work, we will note the contrast with our approach, in that we model prices as arising from the strategic behavior of agents in the system.
The standard baseline approach for analyzing the interaction of buyers and sellers is the Walrasian model in which anonymous buyers and sellers trade a good at a single market  clearing price.
(Sellers appearing in no triple keep their copy of the good.)
In the general equilibrium literature there have been various attempts to introduce price determination.
We picture each good that is sold flowing along a sequence of two edges: from a seller to a trader, and then from the trader to a buyer.
In contrast, our model has known valuations and prices arising from the strategic behavior of traders.
(c) A form of implicit perfect competition: all bid/ask spreads will be zero in equilibrium, even though no trader directly competes with any other trader for the same buyer-seller pair.
If multiple traders propose the same price to a seller or buyer, then there is no strict best response for the seller or buyer.
There is an  undirected graph G that indicates who is able to trade with whom.
Since the concern here is with truthful mechanisms that operate on private valuations, there is an inherent trade-off between the efficiency of the allocation and the budget-balance condition.
The edges of the network  connect traders to buyers and sellers, and thus represent the access that different market participants have to one another.
(We can also handle a model in which a trader offers bids  (respectively, asks) in the form of vectors, essentially specifying a menu with a price attached to each buyer (resp.
A monopolist uses its  knowledge of market demand to choose a price, or a collection of prices if it discriminates.
Note that one can construct a k-unit auction with > k buyers just as easily, by building a complete bipartite graph on k sellers and traders, and then attaching each trader to a single distinct buyer.
Financial markets provide a different example of a setting with these general characteristics.
In other words, all traders make zero profit, whether or not a copy of the good passes through them - and yet, no two traders have any seller-buyer paths in common.
The example in Figure 1(c) gives an initial indication of this: one can show that for every equilibrium, there is a y ∈ [0, 1] such that every bid and every ask price is equal to y.
In this case a selection must be made, and, as is standard (see for example [10]), we (the modelers) choose among the best offers.
They study the dual of a linear program based on the matching problem, similar to what we use for a reduced version of our model in the next section, but their focus is different as they do not consider agents that seek to set prices. 
No agent wants more than one copy of the good, so additional copies are valued at 0.
Each buyer and seller selects an offer from an adjacent trader, and the payoffs to all agents are determined as before.
(b) A network in which the middle seller and buyer benefit from perfect competition between the traders, while the other sellers and buyers have no power due to their position in the network.
This reduced form of trade, built on the idealization of a market price, is a powerful model which has led to many insights.
Specifically, seller i2 and buyer j2 occupy powerful positions, because the two traders are competing for their business; on the other hand, the other sellers and buyers are in weak positions, because they each have only one option.
from top to bottom; traders are drawn as squares in the middle column and will be named t1, t2, .
Extending the Model to Distinguishable Goods.
[1], and Chu and Shen [4] consider an approach based on mechanism design: buyers and sellers reside at different nodes in a graph, and they incur a given  transportation cost to trade with one another.
(The choice of a single edge reflects the facts that (a) sellers each initially have only one copy of the good, and (b) buyers each only want one copy of the good.)
Our work here is connected to several lines of research in  economics, finance, and algorithmic game theory, and we discuss these connections in more detail later in the introduction.
But as our subsequent results will show, traders make zero profit more generally due to global, graph-theoretic reasons.
Oliogopolists play a game in which their  payoffs depend on market demand and the actions of their competitors.
The Walrasian  auctioneer is often introduced as a device to explain how this process works, but this is a fundamentally a metaphor for an iterative  priceupdating algorithm, not for the internals of an actual market.
For each trader t, with accepted offers from sellers i1, .
We show that this game always has a 143 subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, and that all equilibria lead to an efficient (i.e.
Sellers and buyers then choose from among the offers presented to them by traders.
Finally, each trader buys a copy of the good from each seller that accepts its offer, and it sells a copy of the good to each buyer that accepts its offer.
Kranton and Minehart use a bipartite graph with direct links between buyers and sellers, and then use an ascending auction mechanism, rather than strategic intermediaries, to determine the prices.
In the equilibrium search literature, firms set prices and consumers search over them (see [3]).
Specifically, i2 and j2 experience the benefits of perfect competition, in that the two traders drive the bid-ask spreads to 0 in competing for their business.
Thus, the assumptions  behind our model are in a sense not directly comparable to those  underlying the mechanism design approach: while we assume known valuations, we do not require a centralized authority to impose a mechanism.
(In that example, two traders each had the ability to move a copy of the good from i2 to j2.)
The buyer with the highest valuation for the good ends up with it, and the surplus is divided between the seller and the associated trader.
This generalizes the case of indistinguishable goods, since we can always have these pairwise valuations depend only on one of the indices.
That is, there is no physical or virtual place where buyers and sellers interact to trade and set prices.
and Chu and Shen additionally provide a a budget-balanced mechanism.
We extend the basic model to a setting with distinguishable goods, as follows.
socially optimal) allocation of goods.
In these markets much of the trade between buyers and sellers is intermediated by a variety of agents ranging from brokers to market makers to electronic trading  systems.
In fact, there is no price as different traders pay or  receive different prices.
Thus, this example illustrates a few crucial ingredients that we will identify at a more general level shortly.
Each seller or buyer then chooses at most one incident edge, indicating the trader with whom they will transact, at the indicated price.
Spreads, defined as the difference between bid and ask prices, differ significantly across these markets, even though the same asset is being traded in the two markets.
These have posited price determination through definitions based on competitive equilibrium or the core, or through the use of truthful mechanisms.
The payoffs are as follows: For each seller i, the payoff from selecting trader t is βti, while the payoff from selecting no trader is θi.
[8] have studied the distribution of prices at competitive equilibrium in a bipartite graph on buyers and sellers, generated using a probabilistic model capable of producing heavy-tailed degree distributions [11].
The Basic Model: Indistinguishable Goods.
There are several literatures in economics and finance which  examine how prices are set rather than just determining equilibrium prices.
We are given a set B of buyers, a set S of sellers, and a set T of traders.
In Figure 1(a), we show how a standard second-price auction arises naturally from our model.
Thus, the network encodes the relative power in the structural positions of the market participants, including the implicit levels of competition among traders.
The literature on imperfect competition is perhaps the  oldest of these.
In this paper, we develop a framework in which such phenomena emerge from a game-theoretic model of trade, with buyers, sellers, and traders interacting on a network.
(In the former case, the buyer receives the good but gives up αtj units of money.)
The price at which the asset trades may differ across these trading venues.
The meaning is for each e ∈ M, the good initially held by ie moves to je through te.
(In the former case, the seller receives βti units of money, while in the latter it keeps its copy of the good, which it values at θi.)
Here the sellers are job applicants, buyers are employers, and traders are the agents that mediate the job  market.
We say that the value of the allocation is equal to P e∈M θjeie − θieje .
Demange, Gale, and Sotomayor [5], and Kranton and Minehart [9], analyze the prices at which trade occurs in a network, working within the framework of mechanism design.
There have been several approaches to studying how network structure determines prices.
, is and buyers j1, .
But there is little research in these literatures examining the effect of restrictions on who can trade with whom.
Let θ∗ denote the maximum value of any allocation M that is feasible given the network.
[6] build on this to consider the strategic aspects of network formation when prices arise from competitive equilibrium.
Some Examples.
For each buyer j, the payoff from selecting trader t is θj −αtj, whle the payoff from selecting no trader is 0.
A standard proof technique for the existence of competitive equilibrium involves a price adjustment mechanism in which prices respond to excess demand.
Suppose the buyer valuations from top to bottom are w > x > y > z.
This defines the basic elements of the game.
A developing country may have many such partially overlapping markets existing  alongside modern efficient markets [2].
This general framework captures matching markets [10, 13]: for example, a job market that is mediated by agents or employment search services (as in hiring for corporate executives, or sports or entertainment figures).
All three types of agents value money at the same rate; and each i ∈ B ∪ S additionally values one copy of the good at θi units of money.
Given inadequate transportation networks, and poor farmers"  limited access to capital, many farmers have no alternative to trading with middlemen in inefficient local markets.
Consumers do end up paying different prices, but all consumers have access to all firms and there are no intermediaries.
More sophisticated processes have been introduced to study the  stability of equilibrium prices or the information necessary to compute them.
To make these precise, we introduce the following notation.
Leonard studies VCG prices in this setting; Babaioff et al.
The equilibrium  concept we use is subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.
To help with thinking about the model, we now describe three illustrative examples, depicted in Figure 1.
Work in information economics has identified similar  phenomena (see e.g.
