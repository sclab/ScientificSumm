When setting up the optimization problem for a trader t above, we used pi to denote the maximum profit i can make without the offer of trader t. Note that this pi is exactly the same pi we use here, the profit of agent i.
This is one of the complementary slackness conditions to make sure the current trade is optimal for trader t. For all seller-buyer pairs (i, j) that a trader t can trade with, we have pi + qti + pj + qtj ≥ θji − θij , (1) which will make sure that qt is a feasible dual solution for the optimization problem faced by trader t. We need to have equality in (1) when trader t is trading  between i and j.
This is one of the complementary slackness conditions for trader t, and will ensure that the trade of t is optimal for the trader.
By optimality of the trade and dual solution z, seller i must trade with some trader t, and that trader will have equality in (1) for the buyer j that he matches with i.
We will need to guarantee the following properties: Trader t trades with agent i whenever qti > 0.
The optimal trade for trader t is obtained by solving a matching problem to find the matching between the sellers S(t) and buyers B(t) that maximizes the total value vtij for trader t. We will need the dual of the linear program of finding the trade of maximum profit for the trader t. We will use qti as the dual variable associated with the constraint of seller or buyer i.
A trader t can make profit in an equilibrium if and only if there is a seller or buyer i adjacent to t such that the connection of trader t to agent i is essential for social  welfarethat is, if deleting agent t from adj(i) decreases the value of the optimal allocation.
The maximum value for P t∈T P i qti above is the maximum profit the set T of traders can make.
Now we get equilibrium bid and ask values as follows.
To see that T can indeed make this much profit, we use the proof of Theorem 3.3.
Next we need to understand the optimization problem of a trader t. Suppose we have bid and ask values for all other traders t ∈ T, t = t. What are the best bid and ask offers trader t can make as a best response to the current set of bids and asks?
On this graph, we then solve the instance of the assignment problem that was also used in Section 2.2, with the value of edge (i, j) equal to θji − θij (since the value of trading between i and j is independent of which trader conducted the trade).
For an edge (i, j) associated with a trader t we need to show the dual solution is feasible, that is zi + zj ≥ θji − θij .
By assumption the trade is still optimal, and we let z be the dual solution for this matching.
Trader t will have to make a bid of at least βtij = θij +pi to seller i and an ask of at most αtji = θji −pj to buyer j to get this trade, so the maximum profit she can make on this trade is vtij = αtji − βtij = θji − pj − (θij + pi).
For a trader t, given the lowest bids βtij and highest asks αtji that can be accepted for sellers i ∈ S(t) and buyers j ∈ B(t), the best trade t can make is the maximum value matching between S(t) and B(t) with value vtij = αtji − βtij for the edge (i, j).
We modify that proof to start with profit vectors p and qt for t ∈ T , and set qt = 0 for all traders t ∈ T .
(i) A trader t can offer a buyer j a menu of asks αtji, a vector of values for all the products that she is connected to, where αtji is the ask for the product of seller i. Symmetrically, a trader t can offer to each seller i a menu of bids βtij for selling to different buyers j.
(ii) Alternatively, we can require that each trader t can make at most one ask to each seller and one bid for each buyer, and an ask has to include the product sold, and a bid has to offer a particular buyer to sell to.
To get the optimal trade, we consider the bipartite graph G = (S ∪ B, E) connecting sellers and buyers where an edge e = (i, j) connects a seller i and a buyer j if there is a trader adjacent to both: E = {(i, j) : adj(i) ∩ adj(j) = ∅}.
Even when goods are indistinguishable, a trader may want to  pricediscriminate, and offer different bid and ask values to different  sellers and buyers.
We will also use the dual of this linear program: min val(z) = X i∈B∪S zi zi ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ S ∪ B. zi + zj ≥ θji − θij ∀i ∈ S, j ∈ B : adj(i) ∩ adj(j) = ∅.
By the proof of Theorem 3.2 the profits of trader t can be written in this form, so the set of traders T cannot make more profit than claimed in this theorem.
To find the maximum possible profit for a trader t or a set of traders T , we need to do the following: Find profits pi ≥ 0 and qti > 0 so that zi = pi + P t∈adj(i) qti is an optimal dual solution, and also satisfies the constraints (1) for any seller i and buyer j connected through a trader t ∈ T. Now, subject to all these conditions, we maximize the sum P t∈T P i∈S(t)∪B(t) qti.
This is clearly true for all traders t that are not trading with i in the equilibrium.
To see why note that decreasing the value of all edges of the form (i, j) associated with trader t by qti keeps the same trade optimum, as we get a matching dual solution by simply resetting qti to zero.
To find a non-crossing equilibrium we need to divide the profit zi between i and the trader t trading with i.
Let t be the trader involved in the trade.
If this is the only trader t that has a tight constraint in (1)  involving seller i then we increase qti and decrease pi till either pi = 0 or another trader t = t will be achieve equality in (1) for some buyer edge adjacent to i (possibly a different buyer j ).
We claim that the  connection between agent i and trader t must be essential, in particular, we claim that social welfare must decrease by at least qti if we delete t from adj(t).
If zi > 0 then either pi > 0 or qti > 0 for some trader t. Agent i can only make profit pi > 0 if he is involved in a trade.
3.1 Bids and Asks and Trader Optimization First we need to understand what bidding model we will use.
We will use qti as the trader t"s profit associated with agent i for any i ∈ S(t) ∪ B(t).
There are two variants of our model depending whether a trader makes a single bid or ask to a seller or buyer, or she offers a menu of options.
Consider an optimal trade x and a dual solution z as before.
To see why it is true for the trader t that i is trading with we use that the current set of bid-ask values is an equilibrium.
To guarantee this in the corresponding bids and asks we need to make sure that whenever pi > 0 there are multiple t ∈ adj(i) that have equation in the above constraint (1).
The profit of trader t in an equilibrium is P i qti.
For each seller i let pi be the maximum profit seller i can make using bids by other traders, and symmetrically assume pj is the maximum profit buyer j can make using asks by other traders (let pi = 0 for any seller or buyer i who cannot make profit).
If qti > 0 for some t, then trader t must trade with i, as his solution is optimal, and by complementary slackness for the dual solution, qti > 0 implies that t trades with i.
For a trader t ∈ T we will use S(t) and B(t) to denote the set of buyers and sellers connected to trader t. In this section we focus on the general case when goods are distinguishable (i.e.
So we have some agent i with qti > 0.
For all other traders t and seller-buyer pairs (i, j) we have the invariant (1), and using this we know we can pick a value γ in the range θij +pi+qti ≥ γ ≥ θji − (pj + qtj ).
3.2 Efficient Trade and Equilibrium Now we can prove trade at equilibrium is always efficient.
This creates an equilibrium with non-crossing bids where t makes at least γ profit (due to trade with seller i).
We call an equilibrium non-crossing if the bid-ask offers a trader t makes for a seller-buyer pair (i, j) never cross, that is βtij ≤ αtji for all t, i, j. THEOREM 3.3.
In Section 2.3 we showed that in the case of pair traders, a trader t can make money if he is essential for efficient trade.
We verify that this starting solution satisfies the first three of the four required properties, and then we can follow the proof to make the fourth property true.
To see that z satisfies complementary  slackness we need to argue that for all other traders t = t we have both qt i = 0 and qt j = 0.
We start by setting pi = zi for all i ∈ S ∪ B and qti = 0 for all i ∈ S ∪ B and traders t ∈ adj(i).
In the case of distinguishable goods, we have to deal with a further complication: the trader has to name the good she is proposing to sell or buy, and can possibly offer multiple different products.
This is true as qt i > 0 implies by complementary slackness of t "s optimization problem that t must trade with i at optimum, and t = t is trading.
Assume i is a seller (the case of buyers is symmetric), and decrease by γ the social value of each edge (i, j) for any buyer j such that t is the only agent connecting i and j.
We need that zi > 0 implies that i trades.
We view qti as the profit made by t from trading with seller or buyer i. Theorem 3.1 summarizes the above discussion.
Now we use the same process as in the proof of Theorem 3.3 to create a non-crossing equilibrium starting with pi = zi for all i ∈ S ∪B, and qti = γ, and all other q values 0.
Yet the only equilibrium is to have bid and ask values equal to 0, and the trader makes no profit.
We show the trade x is optimal by considering the dual solution zi = pi + P t qti for all agents i ∈ B ∪ S. We claim z is a dual solution, and it satisfies complementary slackness with trade x.
For a trader t that has equality for the seller-buyer pair (i, j) in (1) we offer αtji = θji − pj and βtij = θij + pi.
Next we want to show that a non-crossing equilibrium always exists.
This maximum value is equal to the minimum of the dual linear program above.
After possibly repeating this for all sellers and buyers, we get profits satisfying all constraints.
Neither the bid nor the ask will be the unique best offer for the buyer, and hence the trade x remains an equilibrium.
Finally, we need to show that the trade variables x also  satisfy the complementary slackness constraint: when xe > 0 for an edge e = (i, j) then the corresponding dual constraint is tight.
Let qti for i ∈ B(t)∪S(t) denote the optimal dual solution to this matching problem as  described by Theorem 3.1.
true for the type of more general traders we consider here, as shown by the example in Figure 3.
Each trader t  currently has the best solution to his own optimization problem.
A trader t finds his optimal trade (given bids and asks by all other 149 traders) by solving a matching problem.
We can do a similar change for a buyer j that has pj > 0 and has only one trader t with a tight constraint (1)  adjacent to j.
There exists a non-crossing equilibrium  supporting any socially optimal trade.
Recall vtij = θji −pj −(θij +pi), and the dual constraint of the trader"s optimization problem requires qti + qtj ≥ vtij.
qti + qtj ≥ vtij ∀i ∈ S(t), j ∈ B(t).
However, we still get a characterization for when a trader t can make a positive profit.
Let p, q be the profits in an equilibrium where t makes money, as described by Theorem 3.2 with P i∈S(t)∪B(t) qti > 0.
First we show the direction that if a trader t can make money there must be an agent i so that t"s connection to i is essential to  social welfare.
Consider a seller with pi > 0.
Then we use the proof of  Theorem 3.3 shows how to turn this into an equilibrium.
Finally, we want to arrange that each agent i with pi > 0 has multiple offers for making profit pi, and the trade occurs at one of his best offers.
Note that this  maximization is a secondary objective function to the primary objective that z is an optimal dual solution.
For any trader t or subset of traders T , the minimum total profit they can make in any equilibrium can be  computed in polynomial time. 
By  complementary slackness of t"s optimization problem we have qti + qtj = vtij.
min val(qt) = X i∈B(t)∪S(t) qti qti ≥ 0 ∀i ∈ S(t) ∪ B(t).
The dual is then the following problem.
Next we extend the results to a model where traders may be  connected to an arbitrary number of sellers and buyers.
3.3 Trader Profits Finally we turn to the goal of understanding, in the case of  general traders, how a trader"s profit is affected by its position in the network.
First, we show how to maximize the total profit of a set of traders.
Finally, if we allow crossing equilibria, then we can find the  minimum possible profit by simply finding a dual solution  minimizing the dual variables associated with agents monopolized by some trader.
Putting these together, we have zi + zj ≥ pi + qti + pj + qtj ≥ vtij + pi + pj = θji − θij .
Now consider a seller-buyer pair (i, j) that trader t can connect.
If for any agent i the bid or ask of trader t were the unique best option, then t could extract more profit by offering a bit larger ask or a bit smaller bid, a contradiction.
We will modify p and q to gradually enforce the last condition, while maintaining the others.
Trade is a solution to the  transshipment linear program used in Section 2.2.
Let pi denote the profit of seller or buyer i.
In the full version of the paper we also discuss the special case of indistinguishable goods in more detail.
Consider an equilibrium, with xe = 1 if and only if trade occurs along edge e = (i, j).
Every equilibrium results in an efficient  allocation of the goods.
both buyers and sellers have valuations that are sensitive to the identity of the agent they are paired with in the allocation).
This change  maintains all invariants, and increases the set of sellers that also satisfy the last constraint.
This guarantees all invariants except the last property about multiple t ∈ adj(t) having equality in (1).
This is not 150 1 1 Figure 3: The top trader is essential for social welfare.
To see the opposite, assume deleting t from adj(t) decreases social welfare by some value γ.
We offer bid and ask values βtij = αtji = γ.
For notational simplicity we will use the menu option here.
We omit the details of this in the present version.
To see this we need to show a few facts.
Our results hold in either model.
