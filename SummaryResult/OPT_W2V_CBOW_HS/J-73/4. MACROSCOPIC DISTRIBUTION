We emphasize that in these models, only the distribution of maximum volume and price is known to the algorithm.
In the volume distribution model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online  algorithm A for selling N shares that using only knowledge of an approximation ˜Pvol of Pvol achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤ 2C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ).
Since the support of Pbins vol has only log(Q) elements, E(Pbins vol ) can vary from 1 (for distributions Pvol that place all of their weight in only one of the log(Q) intervals between Vmin , Vmin 2, Vmin 4, .
4.1 Results in the Macroscopic Distribution Model We begin by noting that the algorithms examined so far work by binning total volumes or maximum prices into bins of exponentially increasing size, and then guessing the index of the bin in which the actual quantity falls.
Here we instead permit only a distribution over crude, macroscopic measures of the entire day"s market activity, such as the total volume and high price, and analyze the worst-case performance  consistent with these crude measures.
, log(Q) − 1, Pbins vol (i) is equal to the  probability, under Pvol , that the daily volume falls in the interval [Vmin 2i−1 , Vmin 2i ), and Pbins vol (log(Q)) is for the last interval [Vmax /2, Vmax ] .
For this reason, we refer to such settings as the macroscopic distribution model.
As an example of this result, suppose our approximation obeys (1/α)Pbins vol (i) ≤ ˜Pbins vol (i) ≤ αPbins vol (i) for all i, for some α > 1.
It is thus natural that the macroscopic distribution model  performance of such algorithms (which are common in  competitive analysis) might depend on the distribution of the true bin index.
Let us define C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ) = log(Q) j=1 ˜Pbins vol (j) log(Q) i=1 P bins vol (i) √ ˜P bins vol (i) .
Then it is easy to show that C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ) ≤ αE(Pbins vol ), so according to Theorems 10 and 11 our penalty for using the approximate distribution is a factor of α in competitive ratio. 
In the volume distribution model, we assume only that there exists a distribution Pvol over the total volume V traded in the market for the day, and then  examine the worst-case competitive ratio over sequences  consistent with the randomly chosen volume.
Our results in the VWAP setting examine the cases where these distributions are known exactly or only approximately.
All proofs in this section are provided in the appendix.
In this case E(Pbins vol ) is a constant (i.e., independent of Q), leading to a constant competitive ratio.
, Vmax ) to log(Q) (for distributions Pvol in which the total daily volume is equally likely to fall in any one of these intervals).
In the volume distribution model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online  algorithm A for selling N shares that, using only knowledge of the total volume distribution Pvol , achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤ 2E(Pbins vol ).
C is minimized at C(Pbins vol , Pbins vol ) = E(Pbins vol ), and C may be infinite if ˜Pbins vol (i) is 0 when Pbins vol (i) > 0.
In Figure 3, we  provide additional specific bounds obtained for empirical total daily volume distributions computed for some real stocks.
On the other hand, if Pvol is exponential, then Pbins vol is uniform, leading to an O(log(Q)) competitive ratio, just as in the more adversarial price-volume setting discussed earlier.
In the remaining, we assume that Q is a power of 2 and the base of the logarithm is 2.
Here Pmaxprice is a distribution over just the maximum price of the day, and we then examine worst-case sequences  consistent with this price (seq(p) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market sequences satisfying max1≤t≤T pt = p).
[3] examines distributional assumptions similar to ours, but they emphasize the  worst196 case choices for the distributions as well, and show that this leads to results no better than the original worst-case  analysis over all sequences.
We define E as E(Pbins vol ) ≡ Ei∼P bins vol 1/Pbins vol (i) 2 =   log(Q) i=1 Pbins vol (i)   2 .
Similarly, for OWT, we can define ROWT(A, Pmaxprice ) = Ep∼Pmaxprice max S∈seq(p) p VWAPA(S) .
Similar results can be obtained for macroscopic distributions of maximum daily price for the one-way trading setting.
We also note that our probabilistic assumptions on S are considerably weaker than typical statistical finance  models, which would posit a detailed stochastic model for the step-by-step evolution of (pt, vt).
The competitive ratios defined so far measure performance relative to some baseline criterion in the worst case over all market sequences S ∈ Σ.
We now examine the setting in which Pvol is unknown, but an approximation ˜Pvol is available.
It has been observed in many online settings that such worst-case metrics can yield  pessimistic results, and various relaxations have been  considered, such as permitting a probability distribution over the input sequence.
We now consider distributional models that are  considerably weaker than assuming a distribution over complete market sequences S ∈ Σ.
In that case, Pbins vol is exponentially increasing and peaks at the last bin, which, having the largest width, also has the largest weight.
Analogous buy-side definitions can be given.
MODELS We conclude our results with a return to the price-volume model, where we shall introduce some refined methods of analysis for online trading algorithms.
We define the  related distribution Pbins vol over bin indices i as follows: for all i = 1, .
As a concrete example, consider the case in which Pvol is the uniform distribution over [Vmin , Vmax ].
We leave the  generalization of these methods to the order book model for future work.
Thus our estimated bin index probabilities are all within a factor of α of the truth.
More precisely, we define RVWAP(A, Pvol ) = EV ∼Pvol max S∈seq(V ) VWAPM (S) VWAPA(S) .
In contrast, we feel that the analysis of specific distributions Pvol and Pmaxprice is natural in many financial contexts and our preliminary experimental results show significant improvements when this rather crude  distributional information is taken into account (see Figure 3).
Note that distributions Pvol of this latter type are far from uniform over the entire range [Vmin , Vmax ].
Let Pvol denote the  distribution of total daily market volume.
Here V ∼ Pvol denotes that V is chosen with respect to distribution Pvol , and seq(V ) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market sequences (p1, v1), .
