Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed  normative aspects into the agents" design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents.
Norms can be used to model such  conventions and hence as a means to regulate the observable  behaviour of agents [6, 29].
Since the regulation of a MAS entails that participating agents need to be aware of the validity of those actions that take place within it, such conflicts ought to be identified and possibly resolved if a claim of validity is needed for an agent to engage in an  action or be sanctioned.
Within a NS conflicts may arise due to the dynamic  nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents" actions.
Further on, in Section 4 we formalise the notion of conflict to subsequently analyse the complexity of conflict detection in terms of CPNs in Section 5.
This algorithm is paramount for the  distributed enactment of a NS.
However, there are very few proposals for computational realisations of normative models - the way norms can be integrated in the design and execution of MASs.
Notice that, when activities are distributed, normative positions must flow from the activities in which they are generated to those in which they take effect.
In order to model the separation of concerns between the coordination level (agents" interactions) and the  normative level (propagation of normative positions), we propose an artifact called the Normative Structure (NS).
Section 6 describes the computational management of NSs by describing their enactment and presenting an algorithm for conflict  resolution.
The paper is organised as follows.
A fundamental feature of open, regulated multi-agent  systems in which autonomous agents interact, is that  participating agents are meant to comply with the conventions of the system.
An agent"s actions within an  activity may have consequences in the form of normative  positions (i.e.
However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.
The type of  regulated MAS we envisage consists of multiple, concurrent,  related activities where agents interact.
Next, in Section 3 we formally define the normative structure  artifact.
We assume that agents may choose not to fulfill all their obligations and hence may be sanctioned by the MAS.
In our paper we approach that problem and propose means to handle conflicting commitments in open, regulated,  multiagent systems in a distributed manner.
We believe that online conflict detection and resolution is required.
Each agent may  concurrently participate in several activities, and change from one activity to another.
In Section 2 we detail a scenario to serve as an example throughout the paper.
To our knowledge, no proposal truly  supports the distributed enactment of normative environments.
For instance, a buyer agent who runs out of credit may be forbidden to make further offers, or a seller agent is obliged to deliver after closing a deal.
Hence, we present a tractable algorithm for conflict resolution.
obligations, permissions, and prohibitions) [26] that may constrain its future behaviour.
We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a  mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and borrowing well-known theoretical results from the field of CPNs.
The few that exist (e.g.
For instance, the seller"s obligation above must flow (or be  propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.
For instance, an agent may be obliged and prohibited to do the 636 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS very same action in an activity.
[10, 13, 24]), operate in a centralised manner which creates bottlenecks and single points-of-failure.
There are many contributions on the subject of norms from sociologists, philosophers and  logicians (e.g., [15, 28]).
Finally, we comment on related work, draw conclusions and report on future work in Section 7.
