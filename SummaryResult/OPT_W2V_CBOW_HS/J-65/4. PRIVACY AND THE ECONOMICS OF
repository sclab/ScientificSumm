Because she discounts the two future events with the same discount factor (although at different times), for certain values of the parameters the individual may conclude that paying to protect herself is worthy.
Eventually, they will risk to incur the highest perceived costs of privacy intrusions (note again that we are simply assuming that individuals believe there are privacy risks and that they increase over time; we will come back to this concept later on).
In the second period, assuming that no intrusion has yet taken place, she may once again protect herself by spending a little more, 6; or she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the next (third) period, expected to cost 9.
If she does so, the individual gets a discount of 2 during the period of enrollment, only to pay one unit each time thereafter because of price  discrimination based on the information she revealed (we make no attempt at calibrating the realism of this obviously abstract example; the point we are focusing on is how time  inconsistencies may affect individual behavior given the expected costs and benefits of certain actions).4 Depending on which period the individual chooses for ‘selling" her data, we have the undiscounted payoffs represented in Table 1.
Similar mathematical arguments can be made for the  comparison between immediate costs with immediate benefits (subscribing to a ‘no-call" list to stop telemarketers from harassing you at dinner), and immediate costs with only future expected rewards (insuring yourself against identity theft, or protecting yourself from frauds by never using your credit card on-line), particularly when expected future  rewards (or avoided risks) are also intangible: the immaterial consequences of living (or not) in a dossier society, or the chilling effects (or lack thereof) of being under surveillance.
A value of 1 would imply that the  individual is so patient she does not discount future utilities.
The individual with immediate  gratification problems, for whom β = 1/2, will instead perceive the benefits from joining now or in period 3 as equivalent (0.5), and will join the program now, thus actually making herself worse off.
IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION The problem of immediate gratification (which is related to the concepts of time inconsistency, hyperbolic  discounting, and self-control bias) is so described by O"Donoghue and Rabin [27, p. 4]: A person"s relative preference for  wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the earlier date gets closer.
In addition, [31] show that when costs are immediate, time-inconsistent individuals tend to procrastinate; when benefits are immediate, they tend to preoperate.
As we learnt from the second scenario, time inconsistency can lead individuals to accept higher and higher risks.
But in the second period they will be comparing 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2) - and so they will postpone their protection again.
Sophisticated privacy advocates might realize that protecting  themselves from any possible privacy intrusion is unrealistic, and so they may start misbehaving now (and may get used to that, a form of coherent arbitrariness).
It represents the individual"s choice - which costs the  individual opts to face: the expected cost of protecting herself at time s, E(cs,p) (in which case x = 1), or the expected costs of being subject to privacy intrusions at a later time s + n, E(cs+n,i).
The experimental literature has convincingly proved that human beings tend to have self-control problems even when they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone  undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in the future.
Individuals in the abstract scenarios we described are aware of their perceived risks and costs.
Imagine that the individual is contemplating these  options and discounting them according to Equation 3.
In surveys completed at time t = 0, subjects asked about their attitude towards  privacy risks may mentally consider some costs of protecting themselves at a later time t = s and compare those to the avoided costs of privacy intrusions in an even more distant future t = s + n. Their alternatives at survey time 0 are represented in Equation 4. min wrt x DU0 = β[(E(cs,p)δs x) + (E(cs+n,i)δs+n (1 − x))] (4) x is a dummy variable that can take values 0 or 1.
Consider first the traditional model of utility that agents derive from consumption: the model states that utility discounts exponentially over time: Ut = T τ=t δτ uτ (2) In Equation 2, the cumulative utility U at time t is the discounted sum of all utilities from time t (the present) until time T (the future).
We assume that β = 1 for individuals with no self control problems and β = 1/2 for everybody else.
δ is the discount factor, with a value 24 Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Benefits from selling period 1 2 0 0 0 Costs from selling period 1 0 1 1 1 Benefits from selling period 2 0 2 0 0 Costs from selling period 2 0 0 1 1 Benefits from selling period 3 0 0 2 0 Costs from selling period 3 0 0 0 1 Table 1: (Fictional) expected payoffs from joining loyalty program.
We have shown in the second scenario above how  sophisticated but time-inconsistent individuals may choose to  protect their information only in period 2.
If β (the parameter indicating the degree of self-control problems) is less than one, chances are that the individual now will  actually choose not to protect herself.
Here we make the simplifying assumption that such benefits are not larger than the future costs  incurred after having revealed one"s tastes.
The time-consistent individuals will obviously choose to protect themselves as soon as possible.
Individuals may tend to downplay the fact that single actions present low risks, but their repetition forms a huge liability: it is a deceiving aspect of privacy that its value is truly  appreciated only after privacy itself is lost.
In period 1, the individual may protect herself by spending 5, or she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the following period, expected to cost 7.
As time goes by, more and more information about the individual has been revealed, and it becomes more costly to be protected against privacy intrusions.
But as she is asked to make an effort to protect herself right now, she chooses to run the risk of privacy intrusion.
Therefore they predict they would incur the expected cost 15 ∗ (1/2), which is larger than  6the cost of protecting oneself in period 2.
We also assume that the economy ends in period 4 for all individuals,  regardless of when they chose to join the loyalty program.
[36] found that privacy advocates were also willing to reveal personal information in exchange for monetary  rewards.
Now the individual will perceive a different picture: min wrt x DUs = δE(cs,p)x + βE(cn,i)δn (1 − x)] (6) Note that nothing has changed in the equation (certainly not the individual"s perceived risks) except time.
At survey time the individual  honestly claimed she wanted to protect herself in  principlethat is, some time in the future.
To summarize, time-inconsistent people tend not to fully appreciate future risks and, if na¨ıve, also their inability to deal with them.
A value of 0 would imply that the  individual discounts so heavily that the utility from future periods is worth zero today.
In period 1,  however, they correctly predict that they will not wait to protect themselves further than period 2.
If she  decides not to protect herself, the cost will be the expected consequences of privacy intrusions.
They will keep on doing so, facing higher and higher risks.
Sophisticated  people with self-control problems may be at a loss, sometimes even when compared to na¨ıve people with time  inconsistency problems (how many privacy advocates do use  privacy enhancing technologies all the time?).
An individual is  considering the adoption of a certain privacy enhancing  technology.
In our  context things are even more interesting because all privacy decisions involve at the same time costs and benefits.
Here too we make no attempt at calibrating the values in Table 2.
In the first period, na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals will compare the costs of protecting themselves then or face a privacy intrusion in the second period.
This will in fact happen when: δE(cs,p) > βE(cn,i)δn (7) Note that Disequalities 5 and 7 may be simultaneously met for certain β < 1.
If she decides to protect herself, the cost will be the amount she pays - for example - for some technology that shields her personal information.
The discount factor is used in economics to capture the fact that having (say) one dollar one year from now is valuable, but not as much as having that dollar now.
4 One may claim that loyalty cards keep on providing  benefits over time.
Protecting your privacy sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present hassle (telemarketers, or people peeping through your  window and seeing how you live - see [33]); but sometimes it represents something akin to getting an insurance against future and only uncertain risks.
By period 2, in fact, they will (correctly) realize that if they wait till period 3 (which they are tempted to do, because 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2)), their self-control bias will lead them to postpone adopting the technology once more  (because 8 > 15 ∗ (1/2)).
Na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals are not aware of their self-control problems - for example, they are those who always plan to start a diet next week.
People in this category choose their behavior today correctly estimating their future time-inconsistent behavior.
In the third period she could protect herself for 8 or face an expected cost of 15 in the following last period.
We assume that both these aggregate costs increase over time, although because of separate dynamics.
It will cost her some money both to protect herself and not to protect herself.
δ is the discount factor for  intertemporal utility as in Equation 2. β is the parameter that captures an individual"s tendency to gratify herself  immediately (a form of time-inconsistent preferences).
The time-consistent individual will choose to join the program at the very last period and rip off a benefit of 2-1=1.
Because 5 > 7 ∗ (1/2), they will prefer to wait until the following period to protect themselves.
But we are able to show that under  certain conditions even costs perceived as very high (as during periods of intense privacy debate) will be ignored.
Time-inconsistent but sophisticated individuals, on the other side, will adopt a protective technology in period 2 and pay 6.
We can provide some fictional numerical examples to make the analysis more concrete.
But when β is zero, the individual does not care for anything but today.
In particular, this will happen when: E(cs,p)δs < E(cs+n,i)δs+n (5) Now, consider what happens as the moment t = s comes.
And we give away our personal information to supermarkets in order to gain immediate discounts - which will likely turn into price discrimination in due time [3, 26].
Suppose that δ = 1 for all types of individuals (this means that for simplicity we do not consider intertemporal discounting) but β = 1/2 for time-inconsistent individuals and β = 1 for everybody else.
So they wait till period 2, because 5 > 6 ∗ (1/2), at which time they will adopt a protective technology (see also [31]).
Now consider how this difference affects decisions in  another scenario, represented in Table 2.
Modifying the traditional model of utility discounting, [23] and then [31] have proposed a model which takes into  account possible time-inconsistency of preferences.
[...] [P]eople have self-control  problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification in a way that their ‘long-run selves" do not appreciate.
This may decrease their own incentive to behave in the optimal way now.
Now a real price should be paid in order to enjoy some form of protection (say, starting to encrypt all of your emails to protect yourself from future intrusions).
In Equation 2, if all uτ were constant - for instance, 10 - and δ was 0.9, then at time t = 0 (that is, now) u0 would be worth 10, but u1 would be worth 9.
This happens even if they are aware of those risks and they are aware that those risks are increasing.
The individual is trying to minimize the disutility DU of these costs with respect to x.
This analytical framework can be applied to the study of privacy attitudes and behavior.
Sophisticated time-inconsistent individuals suffer of immediate  gratification bias, but are at least aware of their inconsistencies.
So we opt against using eCash [9] in order to save us the costs of switching from credit cards.
However, under certain conditions, the magnitude of those liabilities is almost irrelevant.
Each individual can enroll in a supermarket"s loyalty program by revealing personal information.
The reader will have noticed that we have focused on  perceived (expected) costs E(c), rather than real costs.
The individual will take very slowly increasing risks, which become steps towards huge liabilities. 
But we accept the risk that our credit card number on the Internet could be used  ma26 Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Protection costs 5 6 8 .
For example, if you were given only two alternatives, on Monday you may claim you will prefer working 5 hours on Saturday to 5 hours and half on Sunday.
In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control bias.
The reasoning is that sophisticated people are aware of their self-control problems, and rather than ignoring them, they incorporate them into their decision process.
This simple observation has rather important consequences in economic theory, where time-consistency of preferences is the dominant model.
But as Saturday comes, you will be more likely to prefer postponing work until Sunday.
It is also interesting to note that these inconsistencies are not caused by ignorance of existing risks or confusion about available technologies.

This dynamics captures the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets [32, 14], where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to others, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.
At the same time, however,  intrusions become more frequent and dangerous.
[31] also suggest that, in addition to the distinction  between time-consistent individuals and individuals with  timeinconsistent preferences, we should also distinguish  timeinconsistent individuals who are na¨ıve from those who are sophisticated.
Again, we focus on the different behavior driven by heterogeneity in time-consistency and sophistication versus na¨ıvete.
We do not know the real costs and we do not claim that the 25 individual does.
We assume for simplicity that δ = 1 for all.
Imagine an economy with just 4 periods (Table 1).
Expected intrusion costs .
When β is 1, the model maps the traditional time-consistent  utility model, and Equation 3 is identical to Equation 2.
We present some scenarios  inspired by the calculations in [31].
Consider Equation 3: Ut(ut, ut+1, ..., uT ) = δt ut + β T τ=t+1 δτ uτ (3) Assume that δ, β ∈ [0, 1].
This is consistent with the results by [36] presented at the ACM EC "01  conference.
