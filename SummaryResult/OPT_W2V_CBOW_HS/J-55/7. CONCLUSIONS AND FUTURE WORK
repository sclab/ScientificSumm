We also show that Υ3 is not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction, but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive  ratio of the overall auction only a little bit.
The most interesting open question from our work is whether the lower bound from Theorem 2 can be matched by an auction for more than three bidders.
Our paper provides partial evidence for this conjecture: the lower bound of Section 6 on conservative auctions shows that the optimal auction must offer sales prices higher than any bid value if the lower bound of Theorem 2 is tight, as is  conjectured.
We conjecture that it can.
Second, we consider whether our techniques can be extended to find optimal auctions for greater numbers of bidders.
The use of our analytic solution method requires knowledge of a restricted class of auctions which is large enough to contain an optimal  auction but small enough that the optimal auction in this class can be found explicitly through analytic methods.
We conjecture that an optimal auction for any number of bidders lies within this class.
We found that the lower bound of [8] is matched by an auction for three bidders, 181 even when competing against generalized benchmarks.
Finally, we remark that very little is known about the structure of the optimal competitive auction.
Another interesting set of open questions concerns aggregation auctions.
As we show, the aggregation auction for Υ3 outperforms the aggregation auction for Υ2 and it appears that the aggregation auction for Υ3 is better than Υm for m > 3.
We leave  verification of this conjecture for future work.
We have found the optimal auction for the three-unit  limitedsupply case, and shown that its structure is essentially independent of the benchmark used in its competitive analysis.
We have then used this auction to derive the best known auction for the unlimited supply case.
It would be interesting to know whether for any m there is an m-aggregation auction that substantially improves on the competitive ratio of AggΥm .
Also, when the number of bidders is greater than three, it might be the case that the optimal auction is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.
Our work leaves many interesting open questions.
The optimal  auction for two bidders, the 1-unit Vickrey auction, also falls within this class of auctions, as its sales prices are restricted to bid values.
No class of auctions which meets these criteria is known even for the four bidder case.
In our auction Υ3, the sales price for a given bidder is restricted either to be one of the other bid values or to be higher than all other bid values.
It remains to show that optimal auctions otherwise only offer sales prices at bid values.
