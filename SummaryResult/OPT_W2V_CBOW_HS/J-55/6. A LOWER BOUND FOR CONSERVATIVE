In order to  satisfy our lower bound, (4), on phk (b), it must put at least 3nr−2r−n n−1 on hk.
As this 180 lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge a sales price higher than any bid in the input.
For any particular k and H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, .
This gives ρhk (b) with nr−1 n−1 probability at 1 and exactly 3nr−2r−n n−1 at each hi for 1 ≤ i < k. Thus, the profit from offering prices at most hk−1 is nr−1 n−1 −kh(k−1)3nr−2r−n n−1 .
We will also let p1(b), phk (b), and pH (b) represent the expected payment of a 1-valued, hk-valued, and H-valued bidder in A on b, respectively (note by symmetry the expected payment for all 1-valued bidders is the same).
Base case (k = 0, hk = 1): A must raise revenue of at least rn on b = (1, .
(3) Equation (1) follows from the conservatism of A and (2) is from invoking the strong inductive hypothesis with H = kh and the observation that the maximum possible revenue will be found by placing exactly enough probability at each multiple of h to satisfy the constraints of the inductive hypothesis and placing the  remaining probability at kh.
Given upper-bounds on the profit from the H-valued, equation bid (3), and the 1-valued bids, the profit from the hk-valued bid must be at least: phk (b) ≥ 2rkh − (n − 2)p1(b) − pH(b) ≥ kh 2r − n(1 − r) n − 1 + (k − 1) 2 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 − O(n).
The lemma is proved by strong induction on k. First some notation that will be convenient.

First, we will find an upper bound on pH(b) pH (b) = 1 0 xρb-H (x)dx + k i=1 hi hi−1 xρb-H (x)dx (1) ≤ 1 + k i=1 hi hi hi−1 ρb-H (x)dx ≤ 1 + 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 k−1 i=1 ih + kh 1 − nr − 1 n − 1 − (k − 1) 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 (2) = kh n(1 − r) n − 1 + (k − 1) 2 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 + 1.
AUCTIONS In this section, we define a class of auctions that never offer a sale price which is higher than any bid in the input and prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of these auctions.
Next, we will find a lower bound on phk (b) by considering the revenue raised by the bids b.
Therefore, the probability that the sale price will be no more than kh on masked bid vector on bid vector b = (1, .
(4) In order to lower bound Pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ kh], consider the auction that minimizes it and is consistent with the lower bounds obtained by the strong inductive hypothesis on Pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ ih].
Recall that A must obtain a profit of at least rF(2) (b) = 2rkh.
Given Lemma 1, Theorem 10 is simple to prove.
But this is a contradiction, so 3nr−2r−n n−1 ≤ 0.
Since we can assume without loss of generality that the auction is symmetric, we will notate b-1 as b with any one of the 1-valued bids masked.
Let A be a conservative auction with competitive ratio 1/r for n bidders.
Let A be a conservative auction for n bidders.
We will prove Theorem 10 with the aid of the following lemma: LEMMA 1.
We say an auction BIf is conservative if its  bidindependent function f satisfies f(b-i) ≤ max(b-i).
The Random Sampling Profit Extraction auction [5] and the CORE auction [7], on the other hand, use the ProfitExtractR mechanism as a subroutine and thus  sometimes offer a sale price which is higher than the highest input bid value.
The competitive ratio of any conservative  auction for an arbitrary number of bidders is at least three.

Inductive case (k > 0, hk = kh): Let b = (1, .
In [8], the authors define a restricted auction as one on which, for any input, the sale prices are drawn from the set of input bid values.
We can now state our lower bound for conservative auctions.
, 1, kh, H) must be at least nr−1 n−1 + k(3nr−2r−n n−1 ).

, 1, hk, H) and placing bounds on ρb-i (z).
Then the competitive ratio of A is at least 3n−2 n .
The base case follows trivially from the final  inequality.
Let h n. Let h0 = 1 and hk = kh  otherwise.
The k-Vickrey auction and the Random Sampling Optimal Price auction [9] are conservative auctions.
Let A be a conservative auction.
The class of conservative auctions can be viewed as a  generalization of the class of restricted auctions and therefore our result below gives lower bounds on the performance of a broader class of auctions.
, 1, kh, H) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1 n−1 + k > 1.
Suppose 3nr−2r−n n−1 = > 0.
For larger numbers of bidders, however, the restriction to conservative  auctions does affect the competitive ratio.
, 1, H) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1 n−1 + k(3nr−2r−n n−1 ).
Υ2, the 1-unit Vickrey auction, is conservative.
For the three-bidder case, Υ3 has competitive ratio 2.17, while the best conservative auction is no better than 2.33-competitive.
Specifically, this result partially explains the form of the optimal three bidder auction.
Let k = 1/ , H ≥ kh, and h n. By Lemma 1, Pr[f(1, .
Then, for all k and H ≥ kh, Pr[f(1, 1, .
For a two-bidder auction, this restriction does not prevent  optimality.
To  minimize the constraints implied by the strong inductive hypothesis, we place the minimal amount of probability mass required each price level.
The theorem follows. 
Thus, r ≤ n 3n−2 .
