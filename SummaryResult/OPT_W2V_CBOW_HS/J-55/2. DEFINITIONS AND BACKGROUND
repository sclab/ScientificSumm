We denote the profit of a truthful auction A on input b as A(b).
The expected profit of the auction, E[A(b)], is the sum of the  expected payments made by each bidder, which we denote by pi(b) for bidder i.
The optimal single price omniscient auction, F, is defined as follows.
When specifying a symmetric  scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the relative magnitudes of the n − 1 bids in b-i and that one of the bids, bj = 1.
In order to evaluate the performance of auctions with respect to the goal of profit maximization, we introduce the optimal single price  omniscient auction F and the related omniscient auction F(2) .
This is without loss of generality as (a) any lower bound that applies to the n = case also extends to the case where n ≥ [8], and (b) there is a  reduction from the unlimited supply auction problem to the limited supply auction problem that takes an unlimited supply auction that is β-competitive with F(2) and constructs a limited supply auction parameterized by that is β-competitive with F(2, ) , the optimal omniscient auction that sells between 2 and units [6].
Let A be a truthful auction.
The deterministic  bidindependent auction defined by f, BIf , works as follows.
We say that A is β-competitive against F(2) (or just β-competitive) if for all bid vectors b, the expected profit of A on b satisfies E[A(b)] ≥ F(2) (b) β .
2.4 Lower Bounds and Optimal Auctions Frequently in this paper, we will refer to the best known lower bound on the competitive ratio of truthful auctions: THEOREM 2.
Henceforth, we will assume that we are in the unlimited supply case, and we will examine lower bounds for limited supply  problems by placing a restriction on the number of bidders in the  auction.
Note that given a single bid, b, a truthful mechanism might offer it price t and if t ≤ b then the bidder wins and pays t; otherwise the  bidder pays nothing (and loses).
It will be convenient to specify such auctions via the density function of f(b-i), ρb-i (z).
The profit of F(2) is max2≤k≤n kb(k) There are a number of reasons to choose this benchmark for comparison, interested readers should see [5] or [6] for a more detailed discussion.
[8] The competitive ratio of any auction on n bidders is at least 1 − n i=2 −1 n i−1 i i − 1 n − 1 i − 1 .
176 2.2 Scale Invariant and Symmetric Auctions A symmetric auction is one where the auction outcome is  unchanged when the input bids arrive in a different permutation.
This bound is derived by analyzing the performance of any  auction on the following distribution B.
This is natural as the profit benchmark we  consider is symmetric, and it allows us to consider only symmetric auctions when looking for the one with the optimal competitive  ratio.
ProfitExtractR: Given bids b, find the largest k such that the highest k bidders can equally share the cost R. Charge each of these bidders R/k.
Thus, we are motivated to consider  symmetric scale-invariant auctions.
2.3 Limited Supply Versus Unlimited Supply Following [8], throughout the remainder of this paper we will be making the assumption that n = , i.e., the number of bidders is equal to the number of units for sale.
Auction F on input b determines the value k such that kb(k) is maximized.
We will use this profit extraction mechanism in Section 5 with the following intuition.
For each bidder i: 1.
In the competitive framework of [5] and subsequent papers, the performance of a truthful auction is gauged in comparison to F(2) , the optimal singled priced auction that sells at least two units.
Such a profit extractor makes it possible to treat this subset of bidders as a single bid with value F(S).
The goal of profit extraction is, given bids b, to extract a target value R of profit from some subset of the bidders.
We denote the probability density of f(b-i) at z by ρb-i (z).
Important properties of this auction are as follows: • ProfitExtractR is truthful.
In each random bid  vector B, each bid Bi is drawn i.i.d.
In the four-bidder case, this lower bound is 96/215.
Let Υn denote the n-bidder auction that achieves the optimal competitive ratio.
We consider single-round, sealed-bid auctions for a set of  identical units of an item to bidders who each desire one unit.
2.5 Profit Extraction In this section we review the truthful profit extraction mechanism ProfitExtractR.
Given this equivalence, we will use the the terminology  bidindependent and truthful interchangeably.
Clearly, the expected payment of each bid satisfies pi(b) = bi 0 xρb-i (x)dx.
An auction is truthful if and only if it is equivalent to a bid-independent auction.
to prices (non-negative real numbers).
Likewise, a mechanism can offer the set of bidders S a target revenue R. If R ≤ F(2) (S), then ProfitExtractR raises R from S; otherwise, the it raises no  revenue from S. 
It is enough to specify such a density function of the form ρ1,z1,...,zn−1 (z) with 1 ≤ zi ≤ zi+1.
A useful simplification of the problem of designing truthful auctions is obtained through the following algorithmic characterization [9].
It is conjectured that this lower bound is tight for any number of bidders and the optimal auction, Υn, matches it.
Given a bid vector of n bids, b = (b1, .
1 The 1-unit Vickrey auction sells to the highest bidder at the second highest bid value.
For a randomized bid-independent auction, f(b-i) is a random variable.
In Section 4 we generalize this framework to other profit  benchmarks.
An auction defined by bid-independent function f is scale  invariant if, for all i and all z, Pr[f(b-i) ≥ z] = Pr[f(cb-i) ≥ cz].
[8] show that a symmetric auction achieves the optimal competitive ratio.
If ti > bi, bidder i loses.
The profit of F on input b is thus F(b) = max1≤k≤n kb(k).
In the next section, we define the  auction Υ3 which matches this lower bound.
All bidders with bi ≥ b(k) win at price b(k); all remaining bidders lose.
The proof of the following theorem can be found, for example, in [5].
Give a vector b = (b1, .
This is achieved by Υ2 which is the 1-unit Vickrey auction.1 In the three-bidder case, this lower bound is 13/6.
A randomized bid-independent auction is a distribution over  deterministic bid-independent auctions.
Otherwise, (ti = bi) the auction can either accept the bid at price ti or reject it.
2.1 Competitive Framework We now review the competitive framework from [5].
It is conjectured that the assumption of scale invariance is without loss of generality.
Let f be a function from bid vectors (with a ‘?")
If no subset of bidders can cover the cost, the mechanism has no winners.
, bn), let b-i denote the vector of with bi replaced with a ‘?
If ti < bi, bidder i wins at price ti.
from the distribution such that Pr[Bi ≥ s] ≤ 1/s for all s ∈ S. In the two-bidder case, this lower bound is 2.
As  mentioned in the introduction, we adopt the game-theoretic solution concept of truthful mechanism design.
, bn), let b(i)  represent the i-th largest value in b.
Set ti = f(b-i).
• If R ≤ F(b), ProfitExtractR(b) = R; otherwise it has no winners and no revenue.
In the limit as the number of bidders grows, this lower bound approaches a number which is  approximately 2.42.
This mechanism is a special case of a general cost-sharing schema due to Moulin and Shenker [11].
