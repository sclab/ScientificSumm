The holy grail of the  worstcase competitive analysis of auctions is the auction that achieves the optimal competitive ratio (as small as possible).
This problem is well studied for the auction design problem where the optimal mechanism is the one that brings the seller the most profit.
The results of this paper are as follows: • We give the auction for three units that is optimally  competitive against the profit of the omniscient single priced  mechanism that sells at least two units.
• Assuming that the conjecture that the optimal -unit auction has a competitive ratio that matches the lower bound proved in [8], we show that this optimal auction for ≥ 3 on some inputs will occasionally offer prices that are higher than any bid in that input (Section 6).
The performance of an auction in such a worst-case competitive analysis is measured by its competitive ratio, the ratio between a benchmark performance and the auction"s performance on the input distribution that maximizes this ratio.
In doing so, we give an optimal three bidder auction for generalized benchmarks (Section 4).
Previous to this work, the best known auction for the unlimited supply case had a competitive ratio of 3.39 [7] and the best lower bound known was 2.42 [8].
The auction is performed by soliciting a sealed bid from each of the bidders and deciding on the allocation of units to bidders and the prices to be paid by the bidders.
Since [9] this search has led to improved understanding of the nature of the  optimal auction, the techniques for on-the-fly pricing in these  scenarios, and the competitive ratio of the optimal auction [5, 7, 8].
Positive results in this direction are fueled by the observation that in auctions for a number of identical units, much of the distribution from which the bidders are drawn can be deduced on the fly by the auction as it is being run [9, 14, 2].
• We give a general technique for converting a limited supply auction into an unlimited supply auction where it is possible to use the competitive ratio of the limited supply auction to obtain a bound on the competitive ratio of the unlimited  supply auction.
When there are three units for sale, the best previously known auction had a competitive ratio of 2.3, compared with a lower bound of 13/6 ≈ 2.17 [8].
The goal of such work is to design an auction that achieves a large constant fraction of the profit attainable by an optimal mechanism that knows the prior distribution in advance.
A particularly interesting special case of the auction problem is the unlimited supply case.
In a truthful auction, revealing one"s true valuation as one"s bid is an optimal strategy for each bidder regardless of the bids of the other bidders.
Furthermore, we give evidence corroborating the  conjecture that the form of the optimal auction is independent of the benchmark used in the auction"s competitive analysis.
When there are only two units for sale, the optimal auction gives a competitive ratio of 2, which matches the lower bound for two units.
The optimal auction is the one which is β-competitive with the minimum value of β.
This auction achieves a competitive ratio of 13/6, matching the lower bound from [8] (Section 3).
To handle the problem of  designing and analyzing auctions where bidders may falsely declare their valuations to get a better deal, we will adopt the solution concept of truthful mechanism design (see, e.g., [9, 15, 13]).
The bidders are assumed to bid so as to maximize their personal utility, the difference between their valuation and the price they pay.
• We improve on the best known competitive ratio by  proving that the aggregation auction constructed from our optimal three-unit auction is 3.25-competitive (Section 5.1).
In this case the number of units for sale is at least the number of bidders in the auction.
For the limited supply case, auctions can achieve substantially better competitive ratios.
Here, the classical approach is to design such a mechanism given the prior distribution from which the bidders" preferences are drawn (See e.g., [12, 4]).
For the three-unit case where we have shown that the lower bound of [8] is tight, this  observation led to our construction of the optimal three-unit auction. 
The assumption that two or more units are sold is  necessary because in the worst case it is impossible to obtain a constant fraction of the profit of the optimal mechanism when it sells only one unit [9].
We consider the single item, multi-unit, unit-demand auction  problem.
• We show that the form of the optimal auction is  independent of the benchmark used in competitive analysis.
This result further validates the use of competitive analysis in gauging auction performance.
The research area of optimal mechanism design looks at  designing a mechanism to produce the most desirable outcome for the entity running the mechanism.
In this framework for competitive analysis, an auction is said to be β-competitive if it achieves a profit that is within a  factor of β ≥ 1 of the benchmark profit on every input.
In such an auction there are many units of a single item  available for sale to bidders who each desire only one unit.
The competitive framework introduced in [9] and further refined in [5] uses the profit of the optimal omniscient single priced  mechanism that sells at least two units as the benchmark for competitive analysis.
In this paper, we will restrict our attention to truthful (a.k.a.,  incentive compatible or strategyproof) auctions.
We refer to auctions derived from this  framework as aggregation auctions (Section 5).
[9] introduced the use of worst-case  competitive analysis (See e.g., [3]) to analyze the performance of auctions that have no knowledge of the prior distribution.
This is natural for the sale of digital goods where there is negligible cost for duplicating 175 and distributing the good.
Each bidder has a valuation representing how much the item is worth to him.
In this paper we continue this line of research by improving in all of these directions.
