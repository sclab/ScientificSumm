One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P)  system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.
Query packets are used to  explore a route to other peers holding resources of interest.
With collaboration among these entities, a MANET P2P system is able to â€˜learn" the network dynamics by itself and adjust its behavior accordingly, without the overhead of organizing peers into an overlay.
As MANET applications demand collaborative  processing and information sharing among mobile nodes, resource  (service) discovery and distribution have become indispensable  capabilities.
Section 3 describes the resource discovery scheme.
These packets work collaboratively, but indirectly, to achieve common tasks, such as resource discovery, routing, and load  balancing.
Adopting this paradigm, the whole MANET P2P system operates as a collection of autonomous entities which consist of different types of control packets such as query and advertisement packets.
This paper describes a design paradigm that uses the following two functional primitives to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs.
Sporadic random walk allows a control packet to explore different paths and opportunistically discover new and/or better routes.
Section 4 describes the resource distribution scheme.
Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) consist of mobile nodes that autonomously establish connectivity via multi-hop wireless  communications.
These systems should also provide efficient and effective ways for peers to interact, as well as other desirable application specific features.
Without relying on any existing, pre-configured network infrastructure or centralized control, MANETs are useful in situations where impromptu communication facilities are  required, such as battlefield communications and disaster relief missions.
However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive  routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.
Due to the dynamic nature of MANETs, P2P systems should be robust by being scalable and adaptive to topology changes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
As the network topology and/or the availability of resources change, existing routes may  become stale while better routes become available.
The replica invalidation scheme is described in Section 5, followed by it performance evaluation in Section 6.
Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially create a scalability problem for large-scale MANETs.
When traversing a route, these control packets measure goodness of the route and leave feedback information on each node along the way to guide subsequent control packets to  appropriate directions.
Related work is described in the next section.
Optionally, advertisement packets are sent out to advertise routes from other peers about available resources.
Section 7 concludes the paper.
