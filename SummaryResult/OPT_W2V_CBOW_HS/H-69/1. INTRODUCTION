We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating  information and achieves an equal qualitative result  compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.
However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.
Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.
We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking  problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with  incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.
In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.
We have proposed and built a vertical image search  engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is  impossible in traditional image search engines.
It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings,  sculptures, music, and so on.
There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.
In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more  appealing to public users than personal photos.
In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich  metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.
However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively  minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].
Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine  rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.
Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.
Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.
To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.
authors in  paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g.
Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of  photos and the number of users in each forum.
For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos,  authors and reviewers.
For example, algorithms that evolved from  PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.
In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the  ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the  optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.
Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.
These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.
Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.
Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from  different photo forums.
High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.
The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.
The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.
This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the  relationships (e.g.
Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.
Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of  locations or other kinds.
In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search.
Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].
To better understand user needs in image search, we  conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.
That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.
However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective  results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.
We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.
This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical  photos.
This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.
Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large  requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.
However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.
For the relevance  factor, search in current commercial image search engines  provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.
Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.
Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].
Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.
More important, there are volunteer users in Web  communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.
In Section 3, we describe the  experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.
We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods  after we have described the problem and our methods.
On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no  effective and practical solution to understand image content.
This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.
1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.
As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the  information they want.
Well-defined means that like objects (e.g.
Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.
The main contributions of this paper are: 1.
We then  formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function.

However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.
Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.
