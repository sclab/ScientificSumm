Many organizations are required to author documents for various purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all member of the organization.
This access may be needed for editing or simply viewing a document.
There may even be multiple different documents in the process of being edited.
The user may be required to search for a particular document, which some search tools such as Google Desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a document on another user"s machine.
In some cases these documents are shared between authors, via email, to be edited.
Another problem arises when a document is made available on a user"s machine and that user is offline, in which case the document is no longer accessible.
This can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a document.
