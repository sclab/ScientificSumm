YaCy is designed to maintain a distributed index of the Internet.
However, Apocrita also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make this system unique.
YaCy however, is designed as a web search engine and, as such solves a much different problem than Apocrita. 
A central area for querying the index is available on the Majestic-12 web page.
YaCy used many peers and DHT to maintain a distributed index.
YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application.
YaCy consists of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p index exchange protocol.
For example, Majestic-12 [4] is a distributed search and indexing project designed for searching the Internet.
The index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed.
The local node is used to query but all results that are returned are accessible on the Internet.
Several decentralized P2P systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that Apocrita features some of their functionality.
Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a DHT.
Each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing a portion of the web.
The distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals.
It used a distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain the index.
