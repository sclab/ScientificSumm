Compared to our work both papers aim to provide the means for  protecting the integrity and confidentiality of messages whereas the goal for our work is to enforce access control inside the  broker network.
The contributions of Srivatsa et al.
In contrast, we assume that some of the brokers on the path of a  publication are trusted to access that publication and are therefore able to implement event matching.

While the work concentrated on using scopes as mechanism for structuring large-scale event-based systems, the notion of event visibility does resonate with access  control to some extent. 
assume in their work that none of the brokers in the network are trusted and therefore all events are encrypted from publisher to subscriber and that all matching is based on encrypted events.
Opyrchal and Prakash address the problem of event  confidentiality at the last link between the subscriber and the SHB in [10].
The paper is a comprehensive overview of  security issues in publish/subscribe systems and as such tries to draw attention to the issues rather than providing  solutions.
Both Srivatsa et al.
and Raiciu et al.
[19] and Raiciu et al.
As a solution they propose a scheme utilising key caching and subscriber grouping in order to minimise the number of required encryptions when delivering a  publication from a SHB to a set of matching subscribers.
in [1] examine the use of role-based access  control in multi-domain, distributed publish/subscribe systems.
We also assume that the publisher and subscriber hosting brokers are always trusted to access the publication.
have categorised the various security issues that need to be addressed in publish/subscribe systems in the future in [20].
are complementary to the contributions in this paper.
[16] present  mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality of messages in  decentralised publish/subscribe infrastructures.
Finally, Fiege et al.
Their work is complementary to this paper: distributed RBAC is one potential policy formalism that might use the enforcement mechanisms we have presented.
Raiciu et al.
Bacon et al.
Wang et al.
They correctly state that a secure group  communication approach is infeasible in an environment like publish/subscribe that has highly dynamic group  memberships.
address the related topic of event  visibility in [6].
