Both cases require access control because event delivery in a dynamic publish/subscribe infrastructure based on a shared broker network may well lead to events being routed through  unauthorised domains along their paths from publishers to  subscribers.
The fact that the CCS are only authorised to read a subset of the vehicle event data will exercise some of the key features of the  enforceable publish/subscribe system access control  presented in this paper.
We propose enforcing  security within the broker network as well as at the edges that event clients connect to, by encrypting event content.
There are two particular benefits to sharing the publish/ subscribe infrastructure, both of which relate to the  broker network.
Access control might also be needed when a single organisation consists of multiple sub-domains that deliver confidential data over the organisation-wide publish/subscribe system.
By controlling access to the encryption keys, we can control access to the event types.
In truly Internet-scale publish/subscribe systems, the event delivery service will include a large set of interconnected broker nodes spanning a wide geographic (and thus network) area.
In our example scenario, the Congestion Charge Service would only be authorised to read the numberplate field of vehicle sightings - the location attribute would not be  decrypted.
However, publish/subscribe systems that do span a wide  geographic area are likely to also span multiple administrative domains, be they independent administrative domains inside a single organisation, multiple independent organisations, or a combination of the two.
In Section 3 we present our model for encrypting event content on both the event and the attribute level.
We have included Detective Smith as a subscriber in this domain.
We expect that access control would need to be enforced in a multi-domain publish/subscribe system when  multiple organisations form a shared publish/subscribe system yet run multiple independent applications.
The proposed  approach allows event brokers to route events even when they have access only to a subset of the potential encryption keys.
This way our multi-domain access  control policy works at a finer granularity - publishers and  subscribers may be authorised access to a subset of the available attributes.
The approach implements access control at the edge of the broker network and assumes that all  brokers can be trusted to enforce the access control policies  correctly.
The architecture provides a mechanism for  authorising event clients to publish and subscribe to event types.
Our overall research aim is to develop Internet-scale  publish/subscribe networks that provide secure, efficient  delivery of events, fault-tolerance and self-healing in the delivery infrastructure, and a convenient event interface.
Second, increasing the inter-connectivity of brokers will  allow the publish/subscribe system to provide higher  faulttolerance.
The Police Information Technology  Organisation (PITO) is the centre from which Police data standards are managed.
Section 4 discusses managing  encryption keys in multi-domain publish/subscribe systems.
The charges that are levied on the vehicles that have passed through the London Congestion Charge zone each day are issued by systems within this domain.
We effectively move the enforcement of access control from the brokers to the encryption key managers.
With encrypted event content only those brokers that are authorised to  ac104 cess the encryption keys are able to access the event content (i.e.
While the communication capabilities of publish/subscribe systems are well proved, spanning multiple administrative domains is likely to require addressing security  considerations.
Our approach is to apply encryption to the individual  attributes of events.
This might be acceptable in a relatively small system deployed inside a single organisation, but it is not appropriate in a multi-domain environment in which organisations share a common infrastructure.
We thus preserve the privacy of motorists while still allowing the CCS to do its job using the shared  publish/subscribe infrastructure.
propose a multi-domain,  capabilitybased access control architecture for publish/subscribe  systems.
Let us assume that a Metropolitan Police Service detective is investigating a crime and she is interested in sightings of a specific vehicle.
We propose enforcing access control within the broker  network by encrypting event content, and that policy dictate controls over the necessary encryption keys.
This domain contains a set of CCTV cameras that publish information about the movements of vehicles around the London area.
Any malicious, compromised or unauthorised broker is free to read and write any events that pass through it on their way from the publishers to the subscribers.
Encryption protects the confidentiality of events should they be transported through unauthorised domains.
The detective gets a court order that authorises her to subscribe to numberplate events of the specific numberplate related to her case.
As security and access control are almost the  antithesis of decoupling, relatively little publish/subscribe research has focused on security so far.
It is the event type owner in this particular scenario.
Current publish/subscribe access control systems enforce  security at the edge of the broker network where clients  connect to it.
Much of its capacity for scale in the number of participants comes from its decoupling of publishers and subscribers by placing an asynchronous event delivery  service between them.
However  encrypting whole events means unauthorised brokers cannot make efficient routing decisions.
Figure 1 shows the multi-domain publish/subscribe network we use as an example throughout this paper.
In cases where non-encrypted events are used for routing, we can reduce the total number of events sent through the system without revealing the values of sensitive attributes.
The privileges of the client are checked by the local broker that the client connects to in order to access the publish/ subscribe system.
Publish/subscribe is well suited as a communication  mechanism for building Internet-scale distributed event-driven  applications.
Publications will be encrypted with their event type specific  encryption keys.
First, sharing brokers will create a physically larger network that will provide greater geographic reach.
publish, subscribe to, or filter).
We introduce decentralised publish/subscribe systems and relevant cryptography in Section 2.
It is based on the United Kingdom Police Forces, and we show three particular sub-domains: Metropolitan Police Domain.
The source  numberplate recognition data comes from the cameras in the Metropolitan Police Domain.
Finally Section 6 discusses related work in securing publish/subscribe systems and Section 7 provides concluding remarks. 
However this approach will often not be  acceptable in Internet-scale systems.

We analytically evaluate the performance of our proposal in Section 5.
