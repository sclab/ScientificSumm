3) is withholding all the streams that have less value of LN compared to the least of the three in the set F. We can find the correct and unique three streams after a few time slots depending on the transportation delay between the domains.
Optimistic algorithm to reduce the number of packets sent over the Internet Furthermore, when VAD is used [13], it would further reduce the traffic by sending the header part of the RTP packet only and not the whole packet, thus in order to keep updating the LN across.
Thus we have to look only at the RTP packets over the WAN, i.e., between participating M-CSs.
Evidently, the chances that the next two dominant streams of that domain being selected to F in the next packet period are less.
As each M-CS from a domain will be sending only NMax out of d M packets to the other CSs ( MaxN d M >> ), the bandwidth used by the application over a WAN is upper-bounded by the following expression.
In the case that there is a joke and every one laughs, then there would be sudden rise in the number of packets and it would be upper bounded by MaxN)d(O 2 for a short period.
The necessary bandwidth is not dependent on the total number of active clients.
E. Exceptions: IF the stream that was in F in the last interval belongs to this CS then select and send that stream even if its LN is now < LNt.
User Interface for setting the weight for NMax audio streams (setting Self-bar to zero avoids echo).
8.1 Pessimistic algorithm Consider a scenario wherein the lowest LN (called LNt) of the three globally selected streams (set F of Section 6.1) exceeds the LN of the most dominant stream of a domain.
As the CS always chooses the best three clients out of all the clients assigned to it in the domain, addition of new clients to the existing conference will not cause any scalability problem.
Note that the packets that are transiting within the LAN take advantage of the higher capacity (generally coupled with multicast capabilities) and therefore do not require a performance analysis.
We see that the above algorithms save bandwidth and computation at each CS, and leads to a scalable architecture with multiple CSs mainly because clients are grouped in domains.
We can instruct CSs during the set-up phase to send unicast packets to those CSs that cannot receive multicast packets whereas CSs on multicast enabled routers can exchange packets on a multicast address.
IF there are >= NMax streams with LN > LNt then send top NMax to other CSs.
H. Send set F to the clients in its domain.
ELSE IF there are (NMax-1) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-1) and see E. ELSE IF there are (NMax-2) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-2) and see E. …… ELSE IF there are NO streams with LN> LNt then don"t send any stream.
The total number of audio packets transiting over the WAN for each time slot is ∑ ∑= ≠=        d i d ijj MaxN 1 ,1 which is quadratic in the number of domains (i.e., O(d2 )).
As the packet period is of the order of 40ms, the error in the selection is unnoticeable.
In this algorithm the saving in traffic is at the cost of relaxing the condition of formation of globally unique set F. However, the discrepancies in selected streams at different domains remain for a short period of time depending on the transportation delay between any two domains.
Yet, one may contend that sending three packets to and from all domains is a waste of resources, as most of these streams will not be selected.
Find the value of lowest LN of the NMax globally selected streams (set F) from the previous time slot.
However, it is independent of the total number of active clients.
C. At each CS domain, select the NMax local streams that have maximum value of LN (ToOtherCSs set) D. Select streams that have LN > LNt IF there are >= NMax streams with LN > LNt then send top NMax to other CSs.
8.4 Quality Improvement The observed improvement in the perceived quality of the conference service is due to: (1) limiting the number of concurrent speakers to a low number such as three.
For a large conference there might be three CSs however, one hop is within the domain incurring negligible delay.
The advantage of this set up is that we can use it even if multicasting is partially available.
At each M-CS/S-CS and for each packet time: B.
It is simple to show that the order of traffic would tend to become O(d) from O(d2 ).
ELSE IF there are (NMax-1) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-1) plus the one lower than LNt (i.e., top NMax) to other CSs.
(Note this occurs only at that CS which had the stream that was the last of the three in the previous packet period.)
Even without Voice Activity Detection (VAD), there will be no more than three streams in the network in the best case, thus the total traffic is constant.
Find the value of lowest LN of the NMax globally selected streams (set F) from the previous time slot.
The number of streams on network in this case is always restricted to NMax (=3).
Example of a 2-level hierarchy of Conference Servers; the shaded Clients are the one selected by the M-CS and will be sent to other domains" CSs.
At each M-CS/S-CS and for each packet time: B.
ELSE IF there are (NMax-2) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-2) plus the one lower than LNt (i.e.
F. Packets sent in step D and E form DB1.
The net network traffic in a packet period in the best case is )1( −⋅ dd , i.e., )( 2 dO using unicast, instead of MaxNdd ⋅−⋅ )1( .
(3) As the streams are mixed only at the clients, there can be a customized mix of the streams.
The echo when self-stream is selected can be avoided by reducing the weight.
C. At each CS domain, select the NMax local streams that have maximum value of LN (ToOtherCSs set).
The analysis was done for the case wherein multicast is not available (a realistic assumption in today"s Internet).
There may be an error in unique selection across all domains for one packet period only.
This is an approximation as saving in multicasting depends also on the topology.
…… ELSE IF there are NO streams with LN> LNt then send top 1 stream to other CSs.
F. For this time slot, find global NMax streams based on LN from DB1 U DB2 (set F) G. Send set F to the clients in its domain.
Here, we send this most dominant stream and withhold the other two.
If just one client is active, selecting a subset of clients in that domain is unnecessary.
The traffic here in this case is O(NMax) for multicast and O(d) for unicast.
In the first time slot (packet time), each CS sends the top NMax streams (based on their LN) to all other CSs.
8.3 Availability of Multicasting In the architecture that has been proposed, no assumption was made about the availability of multicasting support from the network.
The traffic will be further reduced if multicasting is available over WAN.
In the first time slot (packet time), each CS sends the top NMax streams (based on their LN) to all other CSs.
Update LNt for the next period.
E. Packets sent in step D form DB1.
Pessimistic algorithm to reduce the number of packets sent over the Internet.
Update LNt for the next period.
A sudden burst of traffic, as described in 8.1, is a particular case.
G. For this time slot, find global NMax streams based on LN from DB1 U DB2 (set F).
This would not have been the case had all packets been sent over the network in each time slot.
Pessimistic and optimistic algorithms as presented in the sequel aim at reducing the traffic further by harnessing the slow varying nature of the LN.
The resulting traffic complexity reduces from O(d2 ) to O(d) in multicast-enabled networks.
In this algorithm, there is at least one stream in each period.
Packets received from other CSs form DB2.
(2) Delay: The audio stream between any two clients will pass through at most two CSs thus reducing the end-to-end delay.
Packets received from other CSs form DB2.
Generally, in a conference if more than two participants speak the intelligibility is lost.
D. Select streams that have LN > LNt.
We now analyze the performance of the algorithm presented in subsection 6.3, i.e., the one taking care of the exchange of audio packets between the different domains.
Even for a total delay of 400ms, for only 10 packet time slots the uniqueness is lost.
The data structures and conference objects inside a CS is given in [14].
As LN varies slowly, the error would get automatically rectified in a subsequent packet period (slot).
Set LNt with this value.
Set LNt with this value.
These advantages are due to exploitation of the characteristics of LN.
Initialize LNt = 0 at an M-CS/S-CS A.
Initialize LNt = 0 at an M-CS/S-CS A.
The conversational analysis demonstrates that there would be a repair mechanism [15] in such a case.
8.2 Optimistic Algorithm The traffic can be reduced further.
The individual tuning of mixing with weights the spatialism is preserved.

The saving is tremendous.
This duration in a real-time interactive conversation is non-perceivable by the listener.
Considerable valuable bandwidth can be saved using this heuristic.
