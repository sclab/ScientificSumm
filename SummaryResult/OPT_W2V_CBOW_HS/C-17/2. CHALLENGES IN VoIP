So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications.
• Interactivity: In Virtual Conferencing Environments (VCEs), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a "real" conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.
The following are of particular concern in the process: • Ease of use: Conferencing must be simple; users need no domain expertise.
Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.
• Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.
Ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies.
Turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition.
CONFERENCING Many challenges arise in building a VoIP application.
• Standardization: The solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.
Traffic on WAN should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.
Management (addition/removal) of clients and servers must be uncomplicated.
The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design.
