This ensures that any client in the conference finally receives the same set of packets for mixing.
In this configuration, the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified, as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS, which will then select NMax packets from all its S-CSs in the domain before sending them to the remote domains.
The shaded clients are the ones selected in their local domains; their audio streams will be sent to other CSs. 
In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.
Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call, it is also possible to use the Conference Server for two-party calls, especially because it is then more functional to create a real conference by adding a third and subsequently more participant(s).
Send the NMax packets in set F to the Clients in its domain.
LN (= ) is a function of the amplitude of the current audio stream plus the activity and amplitude over a specific window in the past.
The present amplitude level of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Recent Past Window starting from the present instant to some past time.
is set at 10-20 percent of the amplitude of the voice samples of a packet in our implementation here.
Loudness Number Î» for the present time instant (or the present packet) is calculated as, 332211 *L*L*L Î±Î±Î±Î» ++= (4) Here 1 2 DQG 3 are chosen such that: 0< 1 2  1 2 DQG 3=1- 1 2) Here, 1 is the weight given to the recent past speech, 2 is the weight given to distant past speech and 3 is the weight given to speech activity in the activity horizon window considered.
The set of packets received is denoted as FromOtherCSs.
The architecture proposes a cascaded or daisy chain topology [10], which can be shown that it cannot scale up for a large conference.
The metric should have the following characteristics [12]: â€¢ A speaker (floor occupant) should not be cut off by a spike in the packet energy of another speaker.
The activity of the speaker in the past is found with a window called Activity Horizon, which spans the recent past window as well as the distant past window and beyond if necessary.
L1 quantifies the Recent Past speech activity, L2 the Distant Past speech activity and L3 gives a number corresponding to the speech activity in the Activity Horizon window quantifying how active the speaker was in the past few intervals.
Audio mixing requires decoding the input audio to linear signals (PCM or analog), performing a linear combination of the signals and  reencoding the result in an appropriate audio format.
This change implies that at most three intermediate entities exist for each audio packet, instead of two in the conventional setup.
In short, the MP receives audio streams from the endpoints involved in a centralized or hybrid multipoint conference, processes them and returns them to the endpoints.
Get all the packets from the Clients that belong to it.
The past activity of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of the packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Distant Past Window, which starts at the point where the Recent Past window ends and stretches back in the past for a pre-defined interval.
Schematic diagram of a CS The limitation of H.323 is that it does not address the scalability of a conference.
2: For each mixing interval, CS 1 chooses the best NMax audio packets out of the M1 (using a criterion termed "Loudness Number, described in the next subsection).
This indicates the need for a metric different from mere individual packet energies.
In that case, the M-CS will create one or many S-CS (Fig.
As the extra hop happens inside the LAN supposed to have a high-speed connectivity, we consider that it should not prevent us from using this hierarchy of CSs when there"s a need to do so.
Though the contribution of the activity horizon looks similar to the contribution of the recent past and distant past windows, past activity is computed from activity horizon window in a differently.
It can also double to convert audio stream formats for a given client if necessary and can work as Translators/Mixers of RTP specification behind firewalls.
There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from remote domains - to process.
Hence all clients obtain a common view of the conference.
The basic parameter used here is packet amplitude, which is calculated as root mean square (rms) of the energies in audio samples of a packet, and denoted by XK.
This implies that a speaker"s speech history should be given some weight.
A floor control mechanism empowered to cut off a speaker forcefully must be ensured.
The different windows used for LN computation The Loudness Number is updated on a packet-by-packet basis.
6, where a single conference takes place between three domains.
Mix these NMax audio packets in set F after linearising and send it to dumb Clients in the domain. }
It may possibly receive and sends these to CSs 2 to P. The set of packets sent is denoted as ToOtherCSs.
Their packets are mixed and played out at the clients.
â€¢ A participant who wants to interrupt a speaker will have to (i) speak loudly and (ii) keep trying for a little while.
It can be seen that the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} is the same at all CSs.
The MP may eliminate or attenuate some of the input signals in order to reduce noise and unwanted components.
Similarly, for each time slot (packet time), a subset, F of all clients is selected (using the same criterion) from the pool of packets from all other CSs plus the NMax clients selected locally.
Thus it handles only one conference at a time.
6.1 Selecting the Streams Similar to SipConf in [27], a Conference Server (CS) [17] has the function of supporting the conference; it is responsible for handling audio streams using RTP.
The incoming packets from other domains will be received by the M-CS, select NMax of them and send them directly to the domain clients, bypassing the  SCSs.
But in a blind conference under discussion, a participant"s intention to interrupt can be conveyed effectively through LN.
According to [15], the cardinality of F, |F| is NMax and is fixed at three.
These requirements are met by Loudness Number [12], which changes smoothly with time so that the selection (addition and deletion) of clients for conference is graceful.
Send these NMax packets to other M-CSs (on Unicast or Multicast, depending on the configuration).
A comprehensive discussion on selection of the various parameters and the dynamics of LN are beyond the scope of this paper.

An MP that processes audio prepares NMax audio outputs from M input streams after selection, mixing, or both.
Multiple CSs may coexist in a domain, as when there are several conferences under way.
6) and transfer its own clients as well as the new clients to them.
In a mixing interval, how should it choose NMax packets out of the M it might possibly receive?
The working of a CS is illustrated on Fig.
Finally, it selects the best NMax packets from the set {ToOtherCSs union FromOtherCSs} and passes these packets to its own group.
After all, even in a face-to-face conference, a more vocal speaker grabs special attention.
Similarly, receive packets from all other M-CSs and store them in database DB2.
In our conferencing setup, selection is by the Master Conference Server (M-CS), which comes into the picture exclusively for media handling.
Now compare the packets in DB1 and DB2 on WKH EDVLV RI DQG VHOHFW D PD[LPXP RI NMax amongst them (to form set F) that should be played out at each Client.
After one conferee becomes silent, another can take the floor.
Also, as there is more than one channel, interruption is enabled.
Three windows are defined as shown in Fig.
Selection algorithm The mechanism proposed here is also depicted on Fig.
One way is to rank the M packets received according to their energies, and choose the top NMax.
A CS serves many clients in the same conference.
The globally unique set F is found using this procedure.
6.4 Selection Algorithm using the LN Following the developments in subsections 6.1 and 6.2, we present the simple algorithm that runs at each Master-Conference Server (Algorithm.
However, this is usually found to be inadequate because random fluctuations in packet energies can lead to poor audio quality.
Signaling-related messages of CSs are dealt in [11].
Store a copy of packets from those NMax Clients in database DB1.
Repeat for each time slot at each M-CS { 1.
L3 yields a quantity that is proportional to the fraction of packets having energies above a pre-defined threshold (Eq.
We have based the design of our CS on H.323 Multipoint Processor (MP) [9].
In a face-to-face conference, body language often indicates the intent to interrupt.
This ensures fairness to all conferees.
This is often referred to as Persistence or Hangover.
All these desirable characteristics are embedded into the LN.
6.2 Loudness Number (LN) A basic question to be answered by the CS is the following.
The threshold is invariant across clients.
A loud conferee is more likely to be heard because of elevated Î».
