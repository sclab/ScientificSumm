In this paper, we introduce and examine a natural  extension of classical evolutionary game theory (EGT) to a setting in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network.
We generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable  strategy (ESS) to networks, and show a pair of complementary results that exhibit the power of randomization in our  setting: subject to degree or edge density conditions, the  classical ESS of any game are preserved when the graph is  chosen randomly and the mutation set is chosen adversarially, or when the graph is chosen adversarially and the mutation set is chosen randomly.
There are many obvious reasons why one would like to examine more general graphs, the primary one being in that many scenarios considered in evolutionary game theory, all interactions are in fact not possible.
The work described here is part of recent efforts  examining the relationship between graph topology or structure and properties of equilibrium outcomes.
This extension generalizes the classical setting, in which all pairs of organisms in an infinite population are equally likely to interact.
More generally, as evolutionary game theory has become a plausible model not only for  biological interaction, but also economic and other kinds of  interaction in which certain dynamics are more imitative than optimizing (see [2, 16] and chapter 4 of [19]), the network constraints may come from similarly more general sources.
Evolutionary game theory on networks has been considered before, but not in the generality we will do so here (see Section 4).
Previous works in this line include studies of the relationship of topology to properties of correlated equilibria in graphical games [11], and studies of price variation in graph-theoretic market  exchange models [12].
The  classical setting can be viewed as the special case in which the underlying network is a clique.
We examine natural strengthenings of our generalized ESS definition, and show that similarly strong results are not possible for them.
More generally, this work contributes to the line of graph-theoretic models for game theory  investigated in both computer science [13] and economics [10]. 
For example,  geographical restrictions may limit interactions to physically  proximate pairs of organisms.
