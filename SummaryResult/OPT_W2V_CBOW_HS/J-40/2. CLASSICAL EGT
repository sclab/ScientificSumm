Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the  population [17].
The standard model of evolutionary game theory  considers an infinite population of organisms, each of which plays a strategy in a fixed, 2-player, symmetric game.
Since an  incumbent will meet another incumbent with probability 1 − and it will meet a mutant with probability , we can  calculate the expected fitness of an incumbent, which is simply (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t).
In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a 1 − fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t, and call these organisms mutants.
The game is defined by a fitness function F. All pairs of members of the infinite population are equally likely to interact with one another.
The strategy s is an ESS if the expected fitness of an  organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t, for all t = s and all sufficiently small .
A strategy s is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the 2-player, symmetric game given by fitness function F, if for every strategy t = s, there exists an t such that for all 0 < < t, (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t) > (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).
In general the notion of ESS is more  restrictive than Nash equilibrium, and not all 2-player, symmetric games have an ESS.
To make this more precise, we describe the basic model of evolutionary game theory, in which the notion of an ESS resides.
In this paper our interest is to examine what kinds of  network structure preserve the ESS strategies for those games that do have a standard ESS.
A consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ESS, it must be the case that F(s|s) ≥ F(t|s), for all strategies t. This inequality means that s must be a best response to itself, and thus any ESS strategy s must also be a Nash equilibrium.
If two organisms interact, one playing strategy s 200 and the other playing strategy t, the s-player earns a fitness of F(s|t) while the t-player earns a fitness of F(t|s).
The fundamental concept of evolutionary game theory is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).
Thus we come to the formal definition of an ESS [19].
First we must of course  generalize the definition of ESS to a network setting. 
Assume two organisms are chosen uniformly at random to play each other.
Similarly, the expected fitness of a mutant is (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).
