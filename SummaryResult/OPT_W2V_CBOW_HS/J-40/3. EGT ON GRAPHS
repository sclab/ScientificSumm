In order to properly define an ESS for an infinite family of finite graphs in a way that recovers the classical definition asymptotically in the case of the family of complete graphs, we first must give a definition that restricts attention to  families of mutant vertices that are smaller than some invasion threshold n, yet remain some constant fraction of the  population.
We say that M is -linear if there exists an , > > 0, such that for all sufficiently large n, n > |Mn| > n. We can now give our definition for a strategy to be  evolutionarily stable when employed by organisms interacting with their neighborhood in a graph.
We first give a definition for a family of mutant vertex sets in such an infinite graph family to contract.
Thus, to violate the ESS property for G, one must witness a family of mutations M in which each Mn is an arbitrarily small but nonzero constant fraction of the population of Gn, but does not contract (i.e.
This prevents invasions that survive merely by constituting a vanishing fraction of the population.
For instance, foreshadowing some of our analysis, if s is an ESS but F(t|t) is much larger than F(s|s) and F(s|t), a mutant set with a great deal of  internal interaction (that is, edges between mutants) may be able to survive, whereas one without this may suffer.
We say that s is an ESS with respect to F and G if for all mutant strategies t = s, there exists an t > 0 such that for any t-linear family of mutant vertices M = {Mn}∞ n=0 all playing t, for n sufficiently large, Mn contracts.
If G is a graph representing the allowed pairwise  interactions between organisms (vertices), and u is a vertex of G playing strategy su, then the fitness of u is given by F(u) = P v∈Γ(u) F(su|sv) |Γ(u)| .
For example, at the group level, in the standard ESS  definition, one need not discuss any particular set of mutants of population fraction .
In Section A.1 we show that the definition given coincides with the classical one in the case where G is the family of complete graphs, in the limit of large n. We note that even in the classical model, small sets of mutants were allowed to have greater fitness than the incumbents, as long as the size of the set was o(n) [18].
Thus all of our definitions shall revolve around an infinite family G = {Gn}∞ n=0 of finite graphs Gn over n vertices, but we shall examine asymptotic (large n) properties of such families.
Before giving formal definitions, some comments are in order on what to expect in moving from the classical to the graph-theoretic setting.
Suppose all the vertices of Mn play a common (mutant) strategy t, and suppose the remaining vertices in Gn play a common (incumbent)  strategy s. We say that Mn contracts if for sufficiently large n, for all but o(n) of the j ∈ Mn, j has an incumbent neighbor i such that F(j) < F(i).
As in the classical setting (which can be viewed as the special case of the complete network or clique), we shall assume an infinite population, by which we mean we examine limiting behavior in a family of graphs of increasing size.
In the definition above there are three parameters: the game F, the graph family G and the mutation family M. Our main results will hold for any 2-player, symmetric game F. We will also study two rather general settings for G and M: that in which G is a family of random graphs and M is arbitrary, and that in which G is nearly arbitrary and M is randomly chosen.
Instead, we assume that organisms interact only with those in their local neighborhood, as defined by an undirected graph or network.
One can view the fitness of u as the average fitness u would obtain if it played each if its neighbors, or the expected fitness u would obtain if it were assigned to play one of its neighbors chosen uniformly at random.
Let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices.
In both cases, we will see that, subject to conditions on degree or edge density (essentially forcing  connectivity of G but not much more), for any 2-player,  symmetric game, the ESS of the classical settings, and only those strategies, are always preserved.
Here sv is the strategy being played by the neighbor v, and Γ(u) = {v ∈ V : (u, v) ∈ E}.
These observations imply that in examining ESS on networks we face definitional choices that were obscured in the classical model.
Let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices.
At the level of individuals, in the classical setting, the assertion that one mutant dies implies that all mutants die, again by symmetry.
In our setting, we will no longer assume that two  organisms are chosen uniformly at random to interact.
Let M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be any family of (mutant) vertices in Gn.
In the classical (complete graph) setting, there exist many symmetries that may be broken in moving to the the network setting, at both the group and individual level.
Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game for which s is a strategy.
Let M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be any family of subsets of vertices of the Gn such that |Mn| ≥ n for some constant > 0.
every mutant set has a subset of linear size that survives all of its incumbent interactions).
Classical evolutionary game theory examines an infinite, symmetric population.
Let > 0, and let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices.
Since all organisms are equally likely to interact, the survival or fate of any specific mutant set is identical to that of any other.
Graphs or networks are inherently  finite objects, and we are specifically interested in their  asymmetries, as discussed above.
Note also that we only require that a mutant have one  incumbent neighbor of higher fitness in order to die; one might considering requiring more.
In the network setting, individual fates may  differ within a group all playing a common strategy.
A reasonable alternative would be to ask that the  condition above hold for all mutants rather than all but o(n).
Indeed, such asymmetries are the primary interest in examining a graph-theoretic generalization.
In the network setting, this may not be true: some mutant sets may be better able to survive than others due to the specific topologies of their  interactions in the network.
In Sections 6.1 and 6.2 we  consider these stronger conditions and demonstrate that our results can no longer hold.
Thus a common theme of these results is the power of randomization: as long as either the network itself is chosen randomly, or the mutation set is chosen randomly, classical ESS are preserved.
