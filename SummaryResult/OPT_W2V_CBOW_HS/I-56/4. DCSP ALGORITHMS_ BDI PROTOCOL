Step 2 - Belief: The belief function GB (Pi,Ci) will return a value bi ∈ {0, 1, 2}, decided as follows: Percept Belief Desire Intention Mediation Execution P B D I Info Message Info Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Figure 3: BDI protocol with Asynchronous  WeakCommitment strategy • bi = 0 when the agent can find an optimal option i.e., if (Si(vi) = 0 or the assignment xi = vi and the current  variables assignments of the neighbors in Fi who have higher priority form a nogood [4]) stored in a list called nogood list and ∃a ∈ Di, Si(a) = 0 (initially the list is empty).
Step 5 - Execution: • If agent i has a domain value as its intention, the agent will update its variable assignment with this value.
If it finds that the intention received from a neighbor agent j is associated with hmax j > hmax i , the agent will automatically cancel its current intention.
Step 4 - Intention: The intention function GI (DS) will return an intention, decided as follows: • If DS = ∅, then select an arbitrary value (say, vi) from DS as the intention.
• bi = 2 when the current assignment is an optimal option i.e., if Si(vi) = 0 and the current state is not a nogood in nogood list.
Mediation: This step is identical to the Mediation step of ABT, except that agent i will now add the nogood contained in the negotiation message received to its own nogood list.
Step 2 - Belief: The belief function GB (Pi,Ci) will return a value bi ∈ {0, 1, 2}, decided as follows: • bi = 0 when agent i can find an option to reduce the number violations of the constraints in Ci, i.e., if ∃a ∈ Di, Si(a) < Si(vi).
Mediation: When agent i receives a negotiation message,  several sub-steps are carried out, as follows: • If the list of agents associated with the negotiation message contains agents which are not in Fi, it will add these agents to Fi, and request these agents to add itself to their  neighbor lists.
This list of assignment is considered as a nogood.

• If bi = 1, it will send the negotiation message to its  neighbors in Ki, and set pi = max{pj} + 1, with agent j ∈ Fi.
To describe each strategy formally, the following mathematical notations are used: • n is the number of agents, m is the number of constraints; • xi denotes the variable held by agent i, (0 ≤ i < n); • Di denotes the domain of variable xi; Fi denotes the  neighbor list of agent i; Ci denotes its constraint list; • pi denotes the priority of agent i; and Pi = {(xj = vj, pj = k) | agent j ∈ Fi, vj ∈ Dj is the current value assigned to xj and the priority value k is a positive integer } is the perception of agent i; • wl denotes the weight of constraint l, (0 ≤ l < m); • Si(v) is the total weight of the violated constraints in Ci when its variable has the value v ∈ Di.
For agent i, beginning initially with (wl = 1, (0 ≤ l < m), pi = i, (0 ≤ i < n)) and Fi contains all the agents who share the constraints with agent i, its BDI-driven DBO strategy is described as follows.
This is not surprising; AWC and ABT are found to be  strategically similar, differing only in the details of some reasoning steps.
Step 5 - Execution: • If agent i has a domain value as its intention, the agent will update its variable assignment with this value.
Step 4 - Intention: The intention function GI (DS) will return an intention, decided as follows: • If DS = ∅, then select an arbitrary value (say, vi) from DS as the intention.
The negotiation message will contain the list of variable assignments of those agents in its neighbor list Fi that have a higher priority than agent i in the current image Pi.
Step 2 - Belief: The belief function GB (Pi,Ci) will return a value bi ∈ {0, 1, 2}, decided as follows: • bi = 0 when agent i can find an optimal option, i.e., if (Si(vi) = 0 or vi is in bad values list) and (∃a ∈ Di)(Si(a) = 0) and a is not in a list of domain values called bad values list.
• If DS = ∅, then assign nil as the intention (to denote its lack thereof).
For agent i, beginning initially with (wl = 1, (0 ≤ l < m); pi = i, (0 ≤ i < n)) and Fi contains all the agents who share the constraints with agent i, its BDI-driven AWC strategy is  described as follows.
• bi = 2 when its current variable assignment is an optimal option, i.e., if Si(vi) = 0 and vi is not in bad value list.
Following, if bi = 1, agent i will find a list Ki of higher priority neighbors, defined by Ki = {k | agent k ∈ Fi and pk > pi}.

As mentioned in Section 3, for an asynchronous mechanism that ABT is, the  mediation step is needed only in a negotiation round when an agent receives a negotiation message.
• Agent i will first check if the sender agent is updated with its current value vi.
Step 3 - Desire: The desire function GD (bi) will return a desire set DS, decided as follows: • If bi = 0, then DS = {a | (a = vi), (Si(a) = 0) and the number of constraint violations with lower priority agents is minimized }.
The agent will add vi to its bad values list if it is so, or otherwise send its current value to the sender agent.
• If DS = ∅, then assign nil as the intention.
• If bi = 1, then DS = {a | a ∈ Di and the number of violations of all relevant constraints is minimized }.
For agent i, beginning initially with (wl = 1, (0 ≤ l < m); pi = i, (0 ≤ i < n)) and Fi contains all the agents who share the constraints with agent i, its BDI-driven ABT strategy is described as follows.
• If bi = 1, then DS = ∅, the agent also finds agent k which is determined by {k | pk = min(pj) with agent j ∈ Fi and pk > pi }.
Step 3 - Desire: The desire function GD (bi) will return a desire set denoted by DS, decided as follows: • If bi = 0, then DS = {a | (a = vi), (Si(a) = 0) and a is not in the bad value list }.
• If bi = 1, agent i will send a negotiation message to agent k, then remove k from Fi and begin its next negotiation round.
The distinguishing point of AWC is that when the agent cannot find a suitable variable assignment, it will change its priority to the highest among its group members ({i} ∪ Fi).
Under our framework, we call the strategies applied the ABT, AWC and DBO strategies, respectively.
• bi = 2 when its current assignment is an optimal option, i.e., if Si(vi) = 0.
Update Ci to be the list of its relevant constraints.
Mediation: Agent i receives all the intentions from its  neighbors.
• bi = 1 when it cannot find an optimal option, i.e., if (∀a ∈ Di)(Si(a) = 0) or a is in bad values list.
Step 3 - Desire: The desire function GD (bi) will return a desire set DS, decided as follows: • If bi = 0, then DS = {a | a = vi, Si(a) < Si(vi) and (Si(vi)−Si(a)) is maximized }.
Update Ci to be the list of 526 The Sixth Intl.
Step 5 - Execution: • If agent i did not cancel its intention, it will update its variable assignment with the intended value.
• bi = 1 when the agent cannot find any optimal option i.e., if ∀a ∈ Di, Si(a) = 0.
Following, agent i will send its intention to all its neighbors.
Step 4 - Intention: This step is similar to the Intention step of ABT.
+ STRATEGIES In this section, we apply the proposed BDI negotiation model presented in Section 3 to expose the BDI protocol and the  different strategies used for three well-known algorithms, ABT, AWC and DBO.
(max{(Si(vi)−Si(a))} will be referenced by hmax i in subsequent steps, and it defines the maximal reduction in constraint violations).
• bi = 1 when it cannot find any option to improve situation, i.e., if ∀a ∈ Di, a = vi, Si(a) ≥ Si(vi).
All these algorithms assume that there is only one variable per agent.
In return, it will receive intentions from these agents before  proceeding to Mediation step.
• If bi = 2, then DS = ∅.
However, for this strategy, the negotiation message will contain the variable assignments (of the current image Pi) for all the agents in Ki.
• If bi = 2, then DS = ∅.
Initially this list is empty and it will be cleared when a neighbor of higher priority changes its variable assignment.
The model is similar to that of incorporating the ABT strategy (see Figure 2).
The request is considered as a type of negotiation message.
Otherwise, the agent will send the message and save the nogood in the nogood list.
4.2 Asynchronous Weak Commitment Search Figure 3 presents the BDI negotiation model incorporating the Asynchronous Weak Commitment (AWC) strategy.
If the same negotiation message had been sent out before, agent i will have nil intention.
The iteration will continue until no agent can improve further, at which time if some constraints remain violated, the weights of The Sixth Intl.

Essentially, by this  synchronous strategy, each agent will search iteratively for  improvement by reducing the total weight of the violated constraints.
Step 1 - Percept: Update Pi upon receiving the info  messages from the neighbors (in Fi).

Following this step, agent i proceeds to the next negotiation round.
• Otherwise, DS = ∅.
