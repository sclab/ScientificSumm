This mediator will collect the intentions from the group - a union of the agent and its neighbors - and determine which intention is to be executed.
In case the agent finds its value in conflict with some of its neighbors", i.e., the combination of values assigned to the variables leads to a constraint violation, the agent will first try to reassign its own variable using a specific strategy.
Once the beliefs are formed, the agent will determine its desires, which are the options that attempt to resolve the current constraint violations.
Following  mediation, the agent may proceed to the next reasoning step to execute its intention or begin a new negotiation round.
The format of the negotiation message and when it is to be sent out are subject to the strategy.
When an agent receives another"s intention which conflicts with its own, the agent must mediate  between the intentions, by either changing its own intention or informing the other agent to change its intention.
Mediation is a step of the protocol that depends on whether the agent"s interaction with others is synchronous or asynchronous.
To summarize, there are three types of beliefs that a DCSP agent can form: (i) it can change its variable assignment to improve the current situation, (ii) it cannot change its  variable assignment and some constraints violations cannot be resolved and (iii) it need not change its variable assignment as all the constraints are satisfied.
According to [12, Ch.1], the BDI architecture is based on a  philosophical model of human practical reasoning, and draws out the process of reasoning by which an agent decides which actions to perform at consecutive moments when pursuing certain goals.
This is an important function of the agent.
The design space when devising a strategy is influenced by the following dimensions: (i) asynchronous or synchronous, (ii)  dynamic or static priority, (iii) dynamic or static constraint weight, (iv) number of negotiation messages to be communicated, (v) the negotiation message format and (vi) the completeness property.
Within the protocol, it will often determine the efficiency of the Percept Belief Desire Intention Mediation Execution P B D I Info Message Info Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Figure 2: BDI protocol with Asynchronous  Backtracking strategy search process in terms of computational cycles and message  communication costs.
The dotted line indicates the Percept Belief Desire Intention Mediation Execution P B D I I I Info Message Info Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Negotiation Message Figure 1: The BDI interaction protocol component or transition which may or may not appear depending on the adopted strategy.
How this sublist is created depends on the strategy devised for the agent.
Thus, our proposed negotiation model can be said to combine the BDI concepts with automated negotiation in a multiagent framework, allowing us to conceptually separate DCSP mechanisms into a common BDI interaction protocol and the adopted strategies.
Once the intention is formed, the agent may either proceed to the execution step, or undergo mediation.
The agent will do nothing if it is in a local stable state - a snapshot of the variables assignments of the agent and all its neighbors by which they satisfy their shared constraints.
In the former, the agents exchange their intentions.
Again, the decision to do so is determined by some criteria of the adopted strategy.
Since, if the agent executes its intention without  performing intention mediation with its neighbors, the constraint violation between the agents may not be resolved.
In an asynchronous one, mediation is needed only in a negotiation round when the agent receives a negotiation  message.
Grounding the scope to the DCSP framework, the common goal of all agents is finding a combination of domain values to satisfy a set of predefined constraints.
A negotiation message can be sent out at the end of one reasoning step and received at the beginning of the next step.
A more in-depth view of this mediation step is provided later in this section.
If the agent takes Belief (i), it will generate a list of its own suitable domain values as its desire set.
If the agent takes Belief (ii), it cannot ascertain its desire set, but will generate a sublist of agents from its neighbor list, whom it will ask to reconsider their variable assignments.
In the latter, there is an agent which acts as a group mediator.
If the agent takes Belief (iii), it will have no desire to revise its domain value, and hence no intention.
Within this scope, we found that we were able to unearth the generic behavior of a DCSP agent and formulate it in a negotiation protocol,  prescribed using the powerful concepts of BDI.
A negotiation message is a message which may be sent within a round.
3.1 The generic protocol Figure 1 shows the basic reasoning steps in an arbitrary round of negotiation that constitute the new protocol.
Info message is sent out at the end of one negotiation round (also called a negotiation cycle), and received at the beginning of next round.
The BDI protocol prescribes the skeletal structure for DCSP negotiation.
The agent will execute by updating its variable assignment if the intention obtained at this step is its own.
In this situation, the agent will use a virtual desire set that it determines based on its adopted strategy.
If it finds a suitable option which meets some criteria of the adopted strategy, the agent will believe it should change to the new option.
In this step, the agent receives info messages from its neighbors in the environment, and using its Percept function, returns an image P. This image contains the current values assigned to the variables of all agents in its neighbor list.
To do so, the agent will send out an info message.
The agent will select a value from its desire set as its intention.
This is the last step of a negotiation round.
The result of this mediation is passed back to the agents in the group.
If no option can be found, the agent will believe it has no option, and therefore will request its neighbors to reconsider their variable assignments.
The agent also updates its constraint list C using some criteria of the adopted strategy.
The agent may put different contents into this type of message as long as it is agreed among the group.
This message is for mediation purposes.
An info message perceived is a message sent by another agent.
The details of the six main reasoning steps for the protocol (see Figure 1) are described as follows for a DCSP agent.
If there is no violation, the agent will believe it is choosing a correct option and therefore will take no action.
Following execution, the agent will inform its neighbors about its new variable assignment and updated priority.
Then if both the variables are initialized with value 1, they will both concurrently switch between the values 2 and 1 in the absence of mediation between them.
Two types of messages are exchanged through this protocol, namely, the info message and the negotiation message.
The criteria for selecting a desire as the agent"s intention depend on the strategy used.
In other words, these dimensions provide technical considerations for a strategy design. 
However it does not always happen that an agent can successfully find such an option.
The main purpose of this message is to update the agent about the current environment.
For a conceptually clearer description, we assume that there is only one variable per agent.
An intention is the best desired  option that the agent assigns to its variable.
In synchronous mechanism, mediation is required in every  negotiation round.
The message will contain the current selected values and priorities of the variables of that sending agent.

• Intention.
We will show in Section 4 that several well-known DCSP mechanisms all inherit this generic model.
In automated negotiation [9], such a solution is called an agreement among the agents.
The image P will drive the agent"s actions in subsequent steps.
• Desire.
• Belief.
The solid line indicates the common component or transition which always  exists regardless of the strategy used.
• Execution.
Using the image P and constraint list C, the agent will check if there is any violated constraint.
There are two types of mediation: local mediation and group mediation.
The BDI model originates with the work of M. Bratman [11].
• Mediation.
Take for example, suppose two agents have variables, x1 and x2, associated with the same domain {1, 2}, and their shared constraint is (x1 + x2 = 3).
