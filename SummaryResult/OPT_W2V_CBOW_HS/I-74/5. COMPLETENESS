The converse does not hold since some basic dialogues  (under a protocol that only permits R3-relevant moves, for  example) will not permit certain moves (like the addition of a node that connects to the root of the argumentation graph after more than two moves) that would be allowed in a  topiccomplete dialogue.
With these definitions of completeness, our task is to  relate topic-completeness - the property that ensures that agents can say everything that they have to say in a dialogue that is, in some sense, important - to the notions of  relevance we have developed - which determine what agents are allowed to say.
If D is topic-complete, no agent can make a move that will extend the argumentation graph.
A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only allows R3-relevant moves will be topic-complete only when AG(D)T has a single branch in which the nodes are labelled in increasing order from the root.
Given Proposition 5.1, these are the conditions under which dialogues conducted under the notion of R3-relevance will always be predetermined, and given how restrictive the  conditions are, such dialogues seem to have plenty of room for rhetoric to play a part.
The second condition ensures that each branch is constructed in full before any new branch is added, and when a new branch is added, the argument that is undercut as part of the  addition will be acceptable, and so the addition will change the status of the argument denoted by that node, and hence the root.
The important distinction between topic- and  protocolcompleteness is that the former is determined purely by the state of the dialogue - as captured by the argumentation graph - and is thus independent of the protocol, while the latter is determined entirely by the protocol.
A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is protocol-complete under a protocol P if no agent can make a move that adds a node to the argumentation graph that is permitted by P. The argumentation graph constructed by a protocol-complete dialogue is called a protocol-complete argumentation graph and is denoted AG(D)P .
The second part of this result only identifies one possible way to ensure that the second condition in Proposition 5.3 is met, so the converse of this result does not hold.
We start by developing ideas of what complete might mean.
A protocol-complete basic dialogue D under a protocol which only includes R1-relevant moves will be topic-complete if AG(D)T : 1. includes no path with adjacent nodes v, denoting A, and v , denoting A , such that A undercuts A and A is stronger that A; and 2. is such that the nodes in every branch have consecutive indices and no node with degree greater than two is an odd number of arcs from a leaf node.
If argument A , denoted by node v is an an  R2relevant move m, m is not R1-relevant if and only if: 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r, and the argument denoted by v defends itself against the argument denoted by v ; or 2. there is an argument A , denoted by node v , that  affects the status of A, and the path from v to r has one or more nodes in common with the path from v to r. Proof.
A protocol-complete basic dialogue D will always be topic-complete under a protocol which only  includes R2-relevant moves and allows every R2-relevant move to be made.
The idea of predeterminism, as described in [18], captures the notion that, under some circumstances, the  result of a dialogue can be established without actually having the dialogue - the agents have sufficiently little room for rhetorical manoeuver that were one able to see the contents of all the Σi of all the αi ∈ A, one would be able to  identify the outcome of any dialogue on a given subject4 .
Only when AG(D)T includes the nodes in the exact order that the corresponding arguments are put forward is it necessary that a topic-complete argumentation graph be constructed.
If we do not require that all R2-relevant moves are made, then there is some room for rhetoric - the way in which alternative lines of argument are presented becomes an issue.
In such cases every dialogue is topic  complete.
If this path is the only branch in the tree, then A will affect the status of A unless the chain of affect is broken by an undercut that can"t change the status of the undercut argument because the latter defends itself.
Obviously, from the definition of a sub-graph, the converse of Corollary 5.1 does not hold in general.
The above discussion of the difference between dialogues carried out under single-path and bushy protocols brings us to the consideration of what [18] called predeterminism, but we now prefer to describe using the term  completeness.
This means that no agent can make a move that is permitted by a basic  protocol, and so D is also protocol complete.
This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain  protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph.
So an R2-relevant move m is not R1-relevant if either its effect is blocked because an argument upstream is not strong enough, or because there is another line of argument that is currently determining the status of the argument at the root.
For the first condition, consider that since AG is a tree, v is connected to r. Thus there is a series of undercut relations between A and A , and this corrresponds to a path through AG.
Any of these are the A in the condition.
The first condition rules out the first condition in Proposition 5.3, and the second deals with the situation that leads to the second condition in Proposition 5.3.
We develop this idea by considering how the argument graphs constructed by dialogues under different protocols compare to benchmark complete dialogues.
For the second condition, as for the first, the only way that A cannot affect the status of A is if something is  blocking its influence.
Where few conditions are required, or conditions are absent, then dialogues between agents with the same knowledge will always play out the same way, and rhetoric has no place.
A basic dialogue D between the set of agents A with a corresponding argumentation graph AG is topic-complete if no agent can construct an argument A that undercuts any argument A represented by a node in AG.
If this is not due to defending against, it must be because there is some node u on the path that represents an argument whose status is fixed somehow, and that must mean that there is another chain of undercut  relations, another branch of the tree, that is incident at u.
We can do this in terms of the structure of the  argumentation graph: Proposition 5.3.
For  dialogues to be predetermined, every move that is R2-relevant must be made.
The converse does not hold in general.
When we need very specific conditions to make protocol-complete dialogues topic-complete, it means that agents have lots of room for rhetorical maneouver when those conditions are not in force.
We can now show 5 Though whether the agent in question can make such a move is another question.
The restriction on R2-relevant rules is exactly that for  topiccompleteness, so a dialogue that has only R2-relevant moves will continue until every argument that any agent can make has been put forward.
Any time that a dialogue ends in a state of protocol-completeness rather than topic completeness, it is ending when agents still have things to say but can"t because the protocol won"t allow them to.
The argumentation graph constructed by a topic-complete dialogue is called a topic-complete argumentation graph and is denoted AG(D)T .
A dialogue is topic-complete when no agent can add  anything that is directly connected to the subject of the  dialogue.
Given what we know about R3-relevance, the  condition on AG(D)P having a single branch is obvious.
One reasonable  definition is that: Definition 5.1.
To find similar conditions for dialogues composed of  R1and R2-relevant moves, we first need to distinguish between them.
Consider a basic dialogue D, with  argumentation graph AG which has root r denoting an  argument A.
That is there are many ways they can bring dialogues to a close before everything that can be said has been said.
However, what we have is sufficient to answer the  question about predetermination that we started with.
This, in turn, means that if the effect is not due to defending against, then there is an alternative move that is R1-relevant - a move that undercuts A in the second condition above5 .
4 Assuming that the Σi do not change during the dialogue, which is the usual assumption in this kind of dialogue.
To distinguish such cases we have: Definition 5.2.
With these conditions, every move required to  construct AG(D)T will be permitted and so the dialogue will be topic-complete when every move has been completed.
Given this, and what we revealed about R1-relevance in Proposition 5.3, we can see that: Proposition 5.5.
Some protocols will prevent agents from making moves even though the dialogue is not topic-complete.
Any dialogue D under a basic protocol P is protocol-complete if it is topic-complete.
Since this second branch denotes another chain of arguments, and these affect the status of the argument denoted by u, they must also affect the status of A.
The Sixth Intl.
We have: Proposition 5.2.
If moves are forced to be R3-relevant, then there is considerable room for rhetorical play. 
For a basic dialogue D, AG(D)P is a sub-graph of AG(D)T .
