The work of Walton and Krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by Reed [23], has been  particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based  dialogue.
Early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of Dignum et al.
Relevance is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24].
Finding ways for agents to reach agreements in  multiagent systems is an area of active research.
This work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of Hamblin [13].
Viewing  dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful  framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].
Our work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering, showing when it can and cannot have an effect. 
In this paper, we extend the work of [18] by considering the role of relevance - the relationship between utterances in a dialogue.
The dialogue game view overlaps with work on conversation policies (see, for example, [6, 10]), but differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue segments.

One mechanism for achieving agreement is through the use of argumentation - where one agent tries to convince another agent of  something during the course of some dialogue.
