On day two, a Stone auction is held, where Alice"s proxy bids $2,000, and Bob"s bids $0 [as he has already obtained a guaranteed $1,500 of surplus from winning a Sand option, and so reduces his Stone bid by this amount].
Let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise an option on the item given the current options held.
On day one, a Sand auction is held, where Bob"s proxy bids $1,500.
By misrepresenting her valuation (i.e., excluding her value of Sand), Alice was able to secure higher surplus by guiding Bob"s bid for Stone to $0.
To fix this, we would prefer to have proxy agents use more caution in acquiring options and use a more adaptive bidding strategy than that in Equation 1.
All bidders have a patience maximum bids while eBay winners have true values much greater than their observed maximum bids then downward bias is introduced in the efficiency calculation at present.
Let Θt be the set of all options a proxy for bidder i already possesses at time t. Let θt ⊆ Θt, be a subset of those options, the sum of whose exercise prices are π(θt), and the goods corresponding to those options being γ(θt).
On day two, a Stone auction is held, where Alice"s proxy bids $1,500 [as she has already obtained a guaranteed $500 of surplus from winning a Sand option, and so reduces her Stone bid by this amount], and Bob"s bids $1,500.
For instance, if a proxy is already holding an option with an exercise price of $3 on some item for which it has value of $10, and it values some substitute item at $5, the proxy could reason that in no circumstance will it be useful to acquire an option on the second item.
This can be computed as follows: bidt i(k) = max L [0, min[ˆvi(L + k) − Π(θ∗ t ), ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)]] (3) where ˆvi(L+k)−Π(θ∗ t ) considers surplus already held, ˆvi(L+ k)−ˆvi(L) considers the marginal value of a good, and taking the max[0, .]
Consider the following example where the proxy scheme is refined to bid the  maximum willingness to pay.
22 The increase in eBay winner surplus between Tables 3 and 4 is to be expected as the α scaling strictly increases the estimated value of the eBay winners while holding the prices at which they won constant.
The Π(θ∗ t ) term in Equation 3 (i.e., the amount of guaranteed surplus bidder i has already obtained) can be influenced by proxy j"s bid.
An area of immediate further work by the authors is to develop a more sophisticated proxy agent that can allow for bidding of maximum willingness to pay (Equation 3) while maintaining truthfulness.
At the end of the second day, Alice"s proxy holds an option with an exercise price of $0 to obtain a good valued for $2,000, and so obtains $2,000 in surplus.
Alice"s proxy wins an option to purchase Sand for $1,500.
Therefore, bidder j may have the incentive to misrepresent her valuation to her proxy if she believes doing so will cause i to bid differently in the future in a manner beneficial to j.
The biggest concern with our scheme is that proxy agents who may be interested in many different items may acquire many more options than they finally exercise.
At the end of the second day, Alice"s proxy holds an option with an exercise price of $1,500 to obtain a good valued for $2,000, and so obtains $500 in surplus.
Bob"s proxy wins an option to purchase Sand for $0.
Let θ∗ t be the set of options currently held that would maximize the buyer"s surplus; i.e., θ∗ t = argmaxθt⊆Θt Π(θt).
Notice that this is not an issue when  bidders are only interested in a single item (as in our empirical study), or have linear-additive values on items.
On day one, a Sand auction is held, where Alice"s proxy bids $2,000 and Bob"s bids $1,500.
All bidders have a patience of 2 days.
Alice"s proxy wins the Stone option for $0.
Just as in eBay, this would allow an opportunity for sellers to improve revenue by overstating the quality of their item (new vs. like new), and raises the issue of how well a reputation scheme could address this. 
Either Alice"s proxy or Bob"s proxy will win the Stone option.
We envision this happening in practice by  sellers defining a classification for their item upon entering the market, for instance via a UPC code.
Let Π(θt) = ˆvi(γ(θt)) − π(θt) be the (reported) available surplus associated with a set of options.
Bob values either one ton of Sand or one ton of Stone for $1,500.
Bob values either one ton of Sand or one ton of Stone for $1,500.
An additional, practical, concern with our proxy scheme is that we assume an available, trusted, and well understood method to characterize goods (and presumably the quality of goods).
Alice declares valuing only Stone for $2,000.
However, and somewhat counter intuitively, we are not able to implement this bidding scheme without forfeiting truthfulness.
Now, consider what would have happened had Alice  declared that she valued only Stone.
Alice values either one ton of Sand or one ton of Stone for $2,000.
considers the overall use of pursuing the good.
We formulate a more sophisticated bidding strategy along these lines.
of 2 days.
This can lead to efficiency loss.
