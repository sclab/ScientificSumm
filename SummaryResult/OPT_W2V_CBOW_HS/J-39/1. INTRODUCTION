Previous work have developed a data-driven approach  toward developing a taxonomy of strategies employed by  bidders in practice when facing multi-unit auctions, but have not considered the sequential bidding problem [26, 2].
[14] have considered the role of options in the context of a single, monolithic, auction design to help bidders with marginal-increasing values avoid exposure in a multi-unit, homogeneous item auction problem.
The extensions are computationally simple, handle temporal  issues, and retain seller autonomy in deciding when to enter the market and conduct individual auctions.
Using this estimate, one can approximate how much greater a bidder"s true value is 2 Prior work has shown price matching as a potential  mechanism for colluding firms to set monopoly prices.
These papers perform equilibrium analysis in simpler settings, assuming bidders can participate in at most two auctions.
LCD screens are a high-ticket item, for which we demonstrate evidence of the sequential bidding problem.
We also extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to  estimate an upper bound on the distribution of value of eBay bidders, taking into account the sequential auction  problem when making the adjustments.
Price  matching alleviates the multiple copies problem by allowing buyers to receive from sellers after purchase the difference between the price paid for a good and a lower price found elsewhere for the same good [7, 15, 18].
[6], exposure  problems exist when buyers desire a bundle of goods but may only participate in single-item auctions.1 For example, if Alice values a video game console by itself for $200, a video game by itself for $30, and both a console and game for $250, Alice must determine how much of the $20 of synergy value she might include in her bid for the console alone.
The problem is also a familiar one of online  decision making.
In other contexts, options have been discussed for selling coal mine leases [23], or as leveled commitment contracts for use in a decentralized market place [24].
A proxy agent exercises options held when the buyer"s patience has expired, choosing options that  maximize a buyer"s payoff given the reported valuation.
We conduct an empirical analysis of eBay, collecting data on over four months of bids for Dell LCD screens (model E193FP) starting in the Summer of 2005.
This presence of  essentially identical items can expose bidders, and sellers, to risks because of the sequential auction problem.
We believe that one leading place of resistance is in the lack of provably optimal bidding  strategies for any but the simplest of market designs.
Furthermore, price matching can reduce the impact of exactly when a seller brings an item to market, as the price will in part be set by others selling the same item.
However, their work uses costly options and does not remove the sequential bidding problem completely.
Potential bidders who do not wish to bear such costs may choose not to participate in the 1 The exposure problem has been primarily investigated by Bykowsky et al.
Electronic markets represent an application of information systems that has generated significant new trading  opportunities while allowing for the dynamic pricing of goods.
Based on this approximation, revenue generated in a simulation of the options-based scheme exceeds  revenue on eBay for the comparable population and sequence of auctions by 14.8%, while the options-based scheme  demonstrates itself as being 7.5% more efficient.
Complex games may lead to bidders employing costly strategies and making mistakes.
While Alice would prefer to participate in whichever auction will have the lower winning price, she cannot  determine beforehand which auction that may be, and could end up winning the wrong auction.
Many authors have written about a future in which  commerce is mediated by online, automated trading agents [10, 25, 1].
The proxy agents use this information to determine how much to bid for options, and follow a dominant bidding strategy across all relevant auctions.
We are interested in creating modifications to eBay-style markets that simplify the bidder problem, leading to simple equilibrium strategies, and preferably better efficiency and revenue properties.
However, their model does not allow auctions to close at distinct times and does not consider the arrival and departure of bidders.
A seller sells an option for a good, which will ultimately lead to either a sale of the good or the return of the option.
in the context of simultaneous single-item auctions.
These two retail policies provide the basis for the scheme proposed in this paper.2 We extend the proxy bidding technology currently  employed by eBay.
1.2 Related Work A number of authors [27, 13, 28, 29] have analyzed the multiple copies problem, often times in the context of  categorizing or modeling sniping behavior for reasons other than those first brought forward by Ockenfels and Roth [20].
However, in our context, auction prices will be matched, which are not explicitly set by sellers but rather by buyers" bids.
The options-based protocol makes truthful and immediate  revelation to a proxy a dominant strategy for buyers, whatever the future auction dynamics.
Buyers interact through a proxy agent, defining a value on all possible bundles of goods in which they have interest together with the latest time period in which they are  willing to wait to receive the good(s).
Why might the sequential auction problem be bad?
In  addition to marketplaces such as eBay, electronic marketplaces are increasingly used for business-to-consumer auctions (e.g.
Another problem bidders may face is the exposure  problem.
This model is used to simulate the performance of the  optionsbased infrastructure, in order to make direct comparisons to the actual performance of eBay in this market.
Additionally, among those bidders who do choose to participate, the mistakes made may lead to inefficient allocations, further limiting revenue opportunities.
Peters & Severinov [21] extend these models to  allow buyers to consider an arbitrary number of auctions, and characterize a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.
from the maximum bid they were observed to have placed on eBay.
Work on online mechanisms and online auctions [17, 12, 22] considers agents that can dynamically arrive and depart across time.
[9] use options for reducing the risks of buyers and sellers in the sequential auction problem.
Our super-proxy extension will take  advantage of a new, real options-based, market infrastructure that enables simple, yet optimal, bidding strategies.
Jiang and Leyton-Brown [16] use machine learning  techniques for bid identification in online auctions. 
1.1 Options + Proxies: A Proposed Solution Retail stores have developed policies to assist their  customers in addressing sequential purchasing problems.
Both problems arise in eBay as a result of sequential auctions of single items coupled with patient bidders with substitutes or complementary valuations.
Without this, we do not expect individual consumers, or firms, to be confident in placing their business in the hands of an automated agent.
Unfortunately, it seems hard to design artificial agents with equilibrium bidding  strategies, even for a simple simultaneous ascending price auction.
Previous work has also sought to provide agents with smarter bidding strategies [4, 3, 5, 1].
One of the most common examples today of an electronic marketplace is eBay, where the gross merchandise volume (i.e., the sum of all successfully closed listings) during 2005 was $44B.
[12] to provide a dominant strategy equilibrium for buyers within our options-based protocol.
There is still little evidence of automated trading in e-markets, though.
Return policies alleviate the exposure problem by allowing  customers to return goods at the purchase price.
The special case for single-unit buyers is equivalent to the protocol of Hajiaghayi et al., albeit with an options-based interpretation.
This is a problem of multiple copies.
Among items listed on eBay, many are essentially identical.
We first infer a  conservative model for the arrival time, departure time and value of bidders on eBay for LCD screens during this period.
All other options are returned to the market and not exercised.
This is especially true in the Consumer  Electronics category [9], which accounted for roughly $3.5B of eBay"s gross merchandise volume in 2005.
For example, Alice may want an LCD monitor, and could potentially bid in either a 1 o"clock or 3 o"clock eBay  auction.
