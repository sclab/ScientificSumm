To isolate the auctions in the  domain of interest, queries were made against the titles of eBay auctions that closed between 27 May, 2005 through 1  October, 2005.6 Figure 1 provides a general sense of how many LCD  auctions occur while a bidder is interested in pursuing a  monitor.7 8,746 bidders (86%) had more than one auction  available between when they first placed a bid on eBay and the 3 For reference, Dell"s October 2005 mail order catalogue quotes the price of the monitor as being $379 without a desktop purchase, and $240 as part of a desktop purchase upgrade.
In the event that a bidder"s proxy has been outbid, a bidder may give the proxy a higher ceiling to use in the auction.
Furthermore, among the 2,216 bidders that never won an item despite participating in  multiple auctions, 421 (19%) placed a losing bid in one auction that was more than $10 higher than the closing price of  another auction in which they bid, submitting a losing bid on average $34 more (standard deviation $23) than the  closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win.
latest closing time of an auction in which they bid (with an average of 78 auctions available).

A simple regression analysis shows that bidders tend to submit maximal bids to an  auction that are $1.22 higher after spending twice as much time in the system, as well as bids that are $0.27 higher in each subsequent auction.
Among the 508 bidders that won exactly one monitor and participated in multiple auctions, 201 (40%) paid more than $10 more than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, paying on average $35 more (standard deviation $21) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win.
For example, the few bundled auctions  selling both a Dell Dimension desktop and the E193FP LCD are excluded.
The proxy will bid on behalf of the bidder only as much as is  necessary to maintain a winning position in the auction, up to the ceiling received from the bidder.
• The item is typically sold as new, and so suitable for the price-matching of the options-based scheme.
Although these measures do not say a bidder that lost could have definitively won (because we only consider the final winning price and not the bid of the winner to her proxy), or a bidder that won could have secured a better price, this is at least indicative of some bidder mistakes. 
The most common type of auction held on eBay is a  singleitem proxy auction.
Only 32.3% of bidders who had more than one auction  available are observed to bid in more than one auction (bidding in 3.6 auctions on average).
eBay"s proxy auction implements an incremental version of a Vickrey auction, with the item sold to the highest bidder for the second-highest bid plus a small increment.
Bidders bid for the item by giving a proxy a value ceiling.
This market was selected for a variety of reasons including: • The mean price of the monitor was $240 (with  standard deviation $32), so we believe it reasonable to  assume that bidders on the whole are only interested in acquiring one copy of the item on eBay.3 • The volume transacted is fairly high, at approximately 500 units sold per month.
Bidders may  communicate with the proxy multiple times before an auction closes.
Figure 1 also illustrates the number of auctions in which each bidder participates.
7 As a reference, most auctions close on eBay between noon and midnight EDT, with almost two auctions for the Dell LCD monitor closing each hour on average during peak time periods.
6 Specifically, the query found all auctions where the title contained all of the following strings: ‘Dell," ‘LCD" and ‘E193FP," while excluding all auctions that contained any of the following strings: ‘Dimension," ‘GHZ," ‘desktop," ‘p4" and ‘GB."
The exclusion terms were incorporated so that the only auctions analyzed would be those selling exclusively the LCD of interest.
Bidders have an average observed patience of 3.9 days (with a standard deviation of 11.4 days).
Auctions open at a given time and  remain open for a set period of time (usually one week).
• The item is not usually bundled with other items.
The script accesses the eBay search engine,4 and returns all auctions containing the terms ‘Dell" and ‘LCD" that have closed within the past month.5 Data was stored in a text file for post-processing.
Raw auction information was acquired via a PERL script.
The market analyzed in this paper is that of a specific model of an LCD monitor, a 19 Dell LCD model E193FP.
