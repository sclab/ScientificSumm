So j > m. Incidentally, this claim also shows that if m = n − 1, then ci = 0 for all i.
We also have n − j > 0 because j ≤ m < n. So cj ≤ 0.
The individual rationality constraint can be  written as follows: Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, .

To satisfy the non-deficit constraint, we must have c0 ≤ 0.

We have zi = 0 for i ≤ j, because for these bids, the jth highest other bid has value 0, so all the ci that are nonzero are multiplied by 0.
