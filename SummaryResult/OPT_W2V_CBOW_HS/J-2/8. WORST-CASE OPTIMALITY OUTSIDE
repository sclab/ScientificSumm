These bid vectors together with the non-deficit constraint and worst-case constraint produce the above set of  inequalities: for example, when j = m + 1, we consider the bid vector ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ m + 1 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
Consider the bid vector where ˆvi = xi for i ≤ k + 1, and ˆvi = 0 for all other i, where the xi are  arbitrary numbers satisfying x1 ≥ x2 ≥ .
Now, let us consider the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
The total  redistribution payment is then (n−k−1)f(x1, x2, .
If a VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic and anonymous, then for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
A VCG redistribution mechanism is  deterministic, anonymous and strategy-proof if and only if there exists a function f : Rn−1 → R, so that the redistribution payment zi received by ai satisfies zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, .
, ˆvn) for all bid vectors and all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Because the mechanism is anonymous, two agents should receive the same redistribution payment if their bids are the same.
Now, consider j = min{i|ti = 0} (which is well-defined because tn−1 = 0).
By induction, this  statement holds for all k < n − 1; when k + 1 = n − 1, we have f(x1, x2, .
This corresponds to 0% redistribution, which is contrary to our assumption that ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0.
By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f : Rn−1 → R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Because the total VCG payment for this bid vector is 0, we must have (n − j)tj = 0.
Hence, if we let j = min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi}, then H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Thus, the total redistribution payment is (n − j)tj.
For any m and n with n = m + 1, the original VCG mechanism (that is, redistributing nothing) is (uniquely) worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint.
, 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. Claim 6. f satisfies the following inequalities: ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m + i)tm+i−1 + (n − m − i)tm+i ≤ m for i = 2, 3, .
≥ ˆvn, the mechanism outputs a unique redistribution payment list: z1, z2, .
We now observe that the inequalities in Claim 6, together with ˆk ≥ k∗ , are the same as those in Claim 4 (where the ti are replaced by the ˆxi).
≥ xk ≥ 0, for some k < n − 1.
Thus, the total VCG redistribution is (n − m − 1)tm+1.
This implies that the total redistribution payment of this mechanism is always nonnegative.
Suppose there is a redistribution mechanism (when the number of units is m and the number of agents is n) that satisfies all of the above properties and has a better  worstcase performance than the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution mechanism, that is, its worst-case  redistribution percentage ˆk is strictly greater than k∗ .
For the case n ≥ m + 2: If such a mechanism exists, its worst-case performance would be better than that of the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution  mechanism, which by Theorem 1 obtains a redistribution  percentage strictly less than 1.
By the same  reasoning as above, the total redistribution payment should be both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0, hence f(x1, 0, .
The first m+1 agents each receive a redistribution payment of tm = 0, and all other agents each receive tm+1.
Hence, we can simply ignore the first variable input to F; let f(x1, x2, .
We recall that when n = m+1, Claim 1 tells us that the only mechanism inside the family of linear redistribution  mechanisms is the original VCG mechanism, so that this  mechanism is automatically worst-case optimal inside this family.
To prove strategy-proofness, we  observe that because an agent"s redistribution payment is not affected by her own bid, her incentives are the same as in the VCG mechanism, which is strategy-proof.
For the purpose of completeness, we provide the following claim for the n = m + 1 case.
No VCG redistribution mechanism  satisfies all of the following: determinism, anonymity,  strategyproofness, efficiency, and (strong) budget balance.
While we needed individual rationality earlier in the  paper, this theorem does not mention it, that is, we can not find a mechanism with better worst-case performance even if we sacrifice individual rationality.
First, let us prove the only if direction, that is, if a VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic,  anonymous and strategy-proof then there exists a deterministic function f : Rn−1 → R, which makes zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Hence, the total redistribution payment should be in [ˆk · 0, 0]-that is, it should be 0.
By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f : Rn−1 → R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, .
For the if direction, if the redistribution payment  received by ai satisfies zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, .
We assumed that for this mechanism, the worst-case redistribution percentage satisfies ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0.
Now, in this bid vector, the lowest bid is 0 because k + 1 < n. But since n = m + 1, the total VCG payment is mˆvn = 0.
, n, consider the bid vectors where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
First, consider the bid vector where ˆvi = 0 for all i.
If the total VCG payment is x, the total redistribution payment should be in [ˆkx, x] (non-deficit criterion).
The  nondeficit constraint gives (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m (because the total VCG payment is m).
This holds for any n ≥ m + 1.
The other n − k − 1 agents each  receive f(x1, x2, .
So, if ˆvi = ˆvj, H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Since our mechanism is required to be strategy-proof, and the space of valuations is unrestricted, zi should be  independent of ˆvi by Lemma 1 in Cavallo [3].
For any m and n with n ≥ m+2, the  worstcase optimal mechanism among the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms is worst-case optimal among all mechanisms that are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint.
Suppose a redistribution mechanism exists that satisfies all of the above properties and has a worst-case performance as good as the original VCG mechanism, that is, its worst-case redistribution percentage is greater than or equal to 0.
≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0.
We will prove that f(x1, x2, .
, 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. Proof of claim.
We first prove that f has the following properties.
Here, each agent receives a redistribution payment f(0, 0, .
So, we have for all bid vectors and i, zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Under this bid vector, the first j agents each get redistribution payment tj−1 = 0, and the remaining n − j agents each get tj.
If j ≤ m, consider the bid vector where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
That is, F is the redistribution payment to an agent that bids ˆvi when the other bids are ˆv1, ˆv2, .
, ˆvn) for all bid vectors and i, then this is clearly a deterministic and anonymous mechanism.
The total VCG payment is m and the total redistribution payment is nf(1, 1, .
The worst-case constraint gives (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≥ ˆkm.
Thus, restricting our attention to linear VCG redistribution mechanisms did not come at a loss.
, 0) = 0, and the other n − 1 agents each receive f(x1, 0, .
If j > m, the property is satisfied.
≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0.
, ˆvn) = H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Hence, in this mechanism, the  redistribution payment is always 0; that is, the mechanism is just the original VCG mechanism.
THE FAMILY In this section, we prove that the worst-case optimal  redistribution mechanism among linear VCG redistribution mechanisms is in fact optimal (in the worst case) among all redistribution mechanisms that are deterministic,  anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint.
Let H(i, x1, x2, .
Hence every agent"s redistribution payment f(0, 0, .
Consider the case where all agents bid 0, so that the total VCG payment is also 0.
For this bid vector, the agent with the highest bid receives a redistribution payment of f(0, 0, .
Incidentally, we obtain the following corollary: Corollary 2.
Thus, we can conclude that ˆk = k∗ , which is contrary to our assumption ˆk > k∗ .
, 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0 (by the above observation) as well less than or equal to 0 (using the  nondeficit criterion and the fact that the total VCG payment is 0).

Hence no  mechanism satisfying all the listed properties has a redistribution percentage greater than k∗ in the worst case.
The total redistribution payment is then nf(0, 0, .
For the agents with the highest k + 1 bids, their  redistribution payment is specified by f acting on an input with only k non-zero variables.

The other inequalities can be obtained in the same way.
So tj = 0 (j ≤ m < n).

For the case n = m + 1: If such a mechanism exists, it would perform as well as the original VCG mechanism in the worst case, which implies that it is identical to the VCG mechanism by Claim 7.

Also let us define F : Rn → R by F(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, .
Combining these two, we get the first inequality.

However, to prove the above claim, we need to show that it is worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that have the desired properties.
Proceeding by induction, let us assume f(x1, x2, .
So far we have only talked about the case where n ≥ m+2.

If tn−1 = 0, consider the bid vector where everyone bids 1.

But the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced. 
This completes the proof for the only if direction.

But this is contrary to the definition of j.
Hence they all receive 0 by  induction assumption.

To prove this theorem, we need the following lemma.
Now, let ti = f(1, 1, .
