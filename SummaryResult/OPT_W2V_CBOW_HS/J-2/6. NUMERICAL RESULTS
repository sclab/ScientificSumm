For n = 20, this is 5.26e − 3, whereas the remaining percentage for the worst-case optimal mechanism is 3.62e−5 in the worst case.
So, the expected value of the remaining percentage is 2 n − 2 n n−2 n−1 = 2 n(n−1) .
Hence the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed is ˆv2− 2 n ˆv3− n−2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 , which has an expected value of E( 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 ) = 2 n − 2 n E ˆv3 ˆv2 .

Finally, we compare the worst-case optimal mechanism to the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, n = m + 2, .
Recall that the total redistribution payment of the  BaileyCavallo mechanism is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1.
When n > m + 2, the worst-case  optimal mechanism outperforms the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case). 
of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed by the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism in the worst case (which is equal to 2 n ).
We see that for any m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (actually, in this case, the worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the  BaileyCavallo mechanism).
The theory of order statistics tells us that the 34 joint probability density function of ˆv2 and ˆv3 is f(ˆv3, ˆv2) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)ˆvn−3 3 (1 − ˆv2) for ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3.

The total amount redistributed is 11 15 ˆv2 + 4 15 ˆv3 − 4 15 ˆv4 + 4 15 ˆv5; in the worst case, 11 15 ˆv2 is redistributed.
Now, E ˆv3 ˆv2 = R 1 0 R ˆv2 0 ˆv3 ˆv2 f(ˆv3, ˆv2)dˆv3dˆv2 = n−2 n−1 .
For the single-unit case, this simplifies to 2 n ˆv3 + n−2 n ˆv2.
That is, the redistribution payment received by each agent is: 11 45 times the second highest bid among the other agents, minus 1 9 times the third highest bid among the other agents, plus 1 15 times the fourth highest bid among the other agents.
We present 1−k (the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed by the worst-case optimal  mechanism in the worst case) instead of k in the second column because writing k would require too many significant digits.
Hence, the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not  redistributed is never more than 4 15 = 26.7%.
Let us present the optimal solution for the case n = 5 in detail.
In the table below, we present the results for a single unit (m = 1).
By solving the above linear program, we find that the optimal values for the ci are c2 = 11 45 , c3 = −1 9 , and c4 = 1 15 .
Perhaps more surprisingly, the worst-case optimal mechanism sometimes does better in the worst case than the  BaileyCavallo mechanism does on average, as the following  example shows.
These results are in Figure 1.
Suppose the bid values are drawn from a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
For selected values of n and m, we solved the linear  program using Glpk (GNU Linear Programming Kit).
