There exist ways of determining the payments that the agents make in such an auction that  incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that is, the payments make the auction strategy-proof.
Around the same time, the same mechanism has been  independently derived by Moulin [19].1 Moulin actually  pursues a different objective (also based on worst-case analysis): whereas our objective is to maximize the percentage of VCG payments that are redistributed, Moulin tries to minimize the overall payments from agents as a percentage of  efficiency.
If the agents use an auction to allocate these  resources, and the sum of the agents" payments in the auction is positive, then this surplus payment must leave the system 30 of the agents (for example, the agents must give the money to an outside party, or burn it).
Another approach that is perhaps preferable is to use a mechanism that is more budget balanced than the VCG mechanism, and maintains all the other desirable properties.
(The VCG mechanism is also known as the Clarke mechanism or, in the specific context of auctions, the  Generalized Vickrey Auction.)
The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case (with the caveat that we only study allocation settings with multiple  indistinguishable units of a single good and unit demand, while Bailey"s and Cavallo"s mechanisms can be applied outside these settings as well).
In such problems, we want to allocate the resources (or items) to the agents that value them the most.
For example, in a single-item auction (where the VCG mechanism coincides with the second-price sealed-bid auction), the amount redistributed to bidder i by Cavallo"s mechanism is 1/n times the second-highest bid among bids other than i"s bid.
each of the n agents receives 1/n of the surplus) will generally result in a mechanism that is not strategy-proof (e.g.
In 2006,  Cavallo [3] pursued exactly this idea, and designed a mechanism that redistributes a large amount of the total VCG payment while maintaining all of the other desirable properties of the VCG mechanism.
Towards the end of this paper, we consider dropping the individual rationality requirement, and show that this does not change the optimal mechanism for our objective.
Unfortunately, in general settings, it is in fact impossible to design mechanisms that satisfy budget balance in addition to the other desirable properties [16, 11, 21].
It is efficient: the chosen allocation always maximizes the sum of the agents" valuations.
The total redistributed is at most the second-highest bid overall, and the redistribution to agent i does not affect i"s incentives because it does not depend on i"s own bid.
One way of trying to  design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the agents" incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained), and that will maintain the other properties.
For Moulin"s objective, dropping individual rationality does change the optimal mechanism (but only if there are  multiple units). 
Finally, we prove that our  mechanism is in fact optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms (even nonlinear ones) that satisfy the desirable properties.
It turns out that the resulting mechanisms are the same.
For example, the agents may be trying to allocate the right to use a shared good on a given day.
For example, for the problem of allocating a single unit, when the number of agents is 10, our mechanism always redistributes more than 98% of the total VCG payment back to the agents (whereas the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism redistributes only 80% in the worst case).
In many settings, another property that would be  desirable is (strong) budget balance, meaning that the payments sum to exactly 0.
Besides strategy-proofness, the VCG mechanism has  several other nice properties in the context of resource  allocation problems.
In light of this impossibility result, several authors have obtained budget balance by sacrificing some of the other desirable properties [2, 6, 22, 5].
Or, the agents may be trying to allocate a resource that they have collectively constructed, discovered, or otherwise obtained.
Finally, it has a no-deficit property: the sum of the agents" payments is always nonnegative.
We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism inside the family, based on worst-case analysis.
Unfortunately, agents" valuations are private knowledge, and self-interested agents will lie about their valuations if this is to their benefit.
It is also  (expost) individually rational: participating in the mechanism never makes an agent worse off than not participating.
Suppose the agents are trying to  distribute some resources among themselves that do not have a previous owner.
All mechanisms in this family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually  rational, and never incur a deficit.
One very general way of doing so is to use the VCG mechanism [23, 4, 12].
We study allocation settings where there are multiple  indistinguishable units of a single good, and all agents have unit demand, i.e.
Both numerical and  analytical solutions of this model are provided, and the resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the  BaileyCavallo mechanism (in the worst case).
Unfortunately, the VCG mechanism is not budget balanced: typically, there is surplus payment.
One solution is to auction off the items, possibly in a combinatorial auction where agents can bid on bundles of items.
in a Vickrey auction, the second-highest bidder would want to increase her bid to obtain a larger  redistribution payment).
Here we propose the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms.
For this specific setting, Cavallo"s mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].
In this paper, we restrict our attention to a limited  setting, and in this setting we extend Cavallo"s result.
they want only a single unit.
Na¨ıve redistribution of the surplus payment (e.g.
Many important problems in computer science and  electronic commerce can be modeled as resource allocation  problems.
