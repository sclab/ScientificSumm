Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.
, an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
(This assumption is not harmful: in environments where anyone can join the auction, running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway, because everyone would want to join to collect part of the redistribution.)
We do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi; because of this, ai"s  incentives are unaffected by this redistribution payment, and the mechanism remains strategy-proof. 
We only consider the case where m < n (otherwise the problem becomes trivial).
After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribution payment.
We also assume that m and n are always known.
Let vi denote the true value of ai.
Thus, the total VCG payment equals mˆvm+1.
Let n denote the number of agents, and let m denote the number of units.
Under the VCG mechanism, each agent among a1, .
When m = 1, this is the second-price or Vickrey auction.
We modify the mechanism as follows.
, am wins a unit, and pays ˆvm+1 for this unit.
Let the set of agents be {a1, a2, .
≥ ˆvn ≥ 0.
