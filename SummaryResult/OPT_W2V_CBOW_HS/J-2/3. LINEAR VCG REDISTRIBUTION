If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent always receives a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism is individually rational.
The mechanism is strategy-proof, because for all i, zi is independent of ˆvi.
Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any bid vector, zn ≥ 0.
It is helpful to see the entire list of redistribution  payments: z1 = c0 + c1ˆv2 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + .
We define the family of linear VCG redistribution  mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms  corresponding to constants ci that satisfy the above constraints (so that the mechanisms will be individually rational and have the no-deficit property).
Since this agent does not win an item (m < n), her utility is just her redistribution payment zn.
The amount that the mechanism returns to agent ai is zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + .
This redistribution mechanism is individually  rational, because all the redistribution payments are  nonnegative, and never incurs a deficit, because (m + 1) m n ˆvm+2 + (n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1 ≤ nm n ˆvm+1 = mˆvm+1.
Example 1 (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism): Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n and ci = 0 for all other i.
In this mechanism, each agent receives a redistribution payment of m n−m−1 times the (m + 1)th  highest reported value from other agents, minus m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) times the (m+2)th highest reported value from other agents.
An agent that wins a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agent"s valuation for the unit,  minus the VCG payment ˆvm+1, plus the agent"s redistribution payment.
Under this mechanism, each agent receives a  redistribution payment of m n times the (m+1)th highest bid from another agent.
If all redistribution payments are always nonnegative, then the mechanism must be individually rational (because the VCG mechanism is individually rational, and the  redistribution payment only increases an agent"s utility).
Also, the mechanism never incurs a deficit, because the total VCG payment is mˆvm+1, which is greater than the amount mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3 that is redistributed.
, am+1 receive a redistribution payment of m n ˆvm+2, and the others receive m n ˆvm+1.
Hence, for the mechanism to be individually rational, the ci must be such that zn is always nonnegative.
≥ ˆvn ≥ 0, the constants ci should make z1 + z2 + .
MECHANISMS We are now ready to introduce the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms.
That is, an agent receives c0, plus c1 times the highest bid other than the agent"s own bid, plus c2 times the second-highest other bid, etc.
+ cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + .
To satisfy the non-deficit criterion, the sum of the  redistribution payments should be less than or equal to the total VCG payment.
Example 2: Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n−m−1 , cm+2 = − m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) , and ci = 0 for all other i.
If the ci have this property, then it actually follows that zi is nonnegative for every i, for the following reason.
Suppose there exists some i < n and some vector of bids ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
Thus, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3.
+ zn ≤ mˆvm+1.
Therefore, an"s  redistribution payment under the new vector should be the same as ai"s redistribution payment under the old vector-but this payment is negative.
Thus, the total redistribution payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m− 1)m n ˆvm+1.
+ cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + .
So for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
, cn−1 produce a mechanism that is individually rational, and not all choices of the constants produce a mechanism that never incurs a deficit.
31 Not all choices of the constants c0, .
An agent that does not win a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agent"s redistribution payment.
zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + .
Then, consider the bid vector that results from replacing ˆvj by ˆvj+1 for all j ≥ i, and letting ˆvn = 0.
To satisfy the individual rationality criterion, each agent"s utility should always be non-negative.
(We note that for this mechanism to make sense, we need n ≥ m + 2.)
+ cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z3 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv4 + .
If we omit ˆvn from this vector, the same vector results that results from omitting ˆvi from the original vector.
+ cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn zn−1 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + .
+ cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn .
≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 such that zi < 0.
+ cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z4 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + .
Such a mechanism is defined by a vector of constants c0, c1, .
zn−2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + .
Also, the mechanism is anonymous.
Consider agent an, the agent with the lowest bid.
Hence, to obtain these properties, we need to place some constraints on the constants.
We now give two examples of mechanisms in this family.
Which of these two mechanisms is better?
Is there another mechanism that is even better?
