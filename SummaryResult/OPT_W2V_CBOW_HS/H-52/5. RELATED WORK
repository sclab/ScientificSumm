Consequently, phonetic approaches should be used only for OOV search; for  searching queries containing also IV terms, this technique affects the performance of the retrieval in comparison to the word based approach.
[17] propose a model for spoken document retrieval using WCNs in order to improve the recall and the MAP of the search.
An alternative approach consists of using word lattices in order to improve the effectiveness of SDR.
They propose three  different retrieval strategies: search both the word and the phonetic indices and unify the two different sets of results; search the word index for IV queries, search the phonetic  index for OOV queries; search the word index and if no result is returned, search the phonetic index.
However, the phonetic transcript is obtained from a text to phonetic conversion of the 1-best path of the word transcript and is not based on a phonetic decoding of the speech data.
However, in the above works, the  problem of queries containing OOV terms is not addressed.

Saraclar and Sproat in [22] show improvement in word spotting accuracy for both IV and OOV queries, using  phonetic and word lattices, where a confidence measure of a word or a phone can be derived.
in [5, 4] propose to merge a word approach with a phonetic approach in the context of video retrieval.
Some of these works have been done in the context of the TREC Spoken Document Retrieval evaluations and are described by Garofolo et al.
This data structure is similar to WCN and leads to a more  compact index.
However, phonetic lattices contain many edges that overlap in time with the same phonetic label, and are difficult to index.
Popular approaches to deal with OOV queries are based on sub-words transcripts, where the sub-words are typically phones, syllables or word fragments (sequences of phones) [11, 20, 23].
The necessity to use a document expansion algorithm was justified by the fact that the word lattices they worked with, lack information about word probabilities.
Moreover, the  algorithms have been mostly tested over long queries stated in plain English and retrieval for such queries is more robust against speech recognition errors.
However, no strategy is proposed to deal with phrase queries containing both IV and OOV terms.
The transcripts are indexed in the same manner as words in using classical text retrieval techniques; during query processing, the query is represented as a  sequence of phones.
An important issue to be considered when looking at the state-of-the-art in retrieval of spoken data, is the lack of a common test set and appropriate query terms.
[24, 25] propose to add some terms to the transcript in order to alleviate the retrieval failures due to ASR errors.
Their approach consists in using word lattices in order to determine which words returned by a document expansion algorithm should be added to the original transcript.
Moreover, beside the improvement in the recall of the search, the precision is affected since  phonetic lattices are often inaccurate.
A generic IR system over the text is used for word spotting and search as described by Brown et al.
The retrieval is based on searching the string of phones representing the query in the phonetic  transcript.
However, the evaluation  framework is carried out on lectures that are relatively planned, in contrast to conversational speech.
The classical approach consists of using  phonetic transcripts.
In the past decade, the research efforts on spoken data retrieval have focused on extending classical IR techniques to spoken documents.
From an IR perspective, a classical way to bring new terms is document expansion using a similar corpus.
The transcripts are indexed as clean text: for each occurrence, its document, its word offset and additional information are stored in the index.
This paper uses such a task and the STD evaluation is a good summary of the performance of different approaches on the same test conditions. 
An LVCSR system is used to transcribe the speech into 1-best path word transcripts.
To account for the high recognition error rates, some other systems use richer transcripts like phonetic lattices.
Their ranking model is based on the term confidence level but does not take into consideration the rank of the term among the other  hypotheses.
Chelba and Acero in [8, 9] propose a more compact word lattice, the position specific posterior lattice (PSPL).
The offset of the terms in the speech documents is also stored in the index.
They are attractive as they accommodate high error rate conditions as well as allow for OOV queries to be used [15, 3, 20, 23, 21, 27].
