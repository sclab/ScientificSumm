4.6 Influence of the duration of the query on the retrieval performance We have analysed the retrieval performance according to the average duration of the occurrences in the manual  transcripts.
As expected, the approach combining word and phonetic indices presented in Section 3 leads to the same retrieval performance as the word approach for IV queries and to the same retrieval performance as the phonetic approach for OOV queries.
We have used the STDEval tool to extract the relevant results from the manual transcripts and to compute ATWV, MTWV and the DET curve.
Hence, it was justified to boost the score of the results with the exponent γn, as explained in Section 3.4.3, according to the length of the query.
For each found occurrence of the given query, our system outputs: the location of the term in the audio recording (begin time and duration), the score indicating how likely is the occurrence of query, (as defined in Section 3.4) and a hard (binary) decision as to whether the detection is  correct.
Note that retrieval performance has been  evaluated separately for each source type since the accuracy of the speech differs per source type as shown in Section 4.2.
For the evaluation, the cost/value ratio, C/V , has been  determined to 0.1 and the prior probability of a query Prq to 10−4 .
It is correlated to the accuracy of the transcripts.
where: • Ncorrect(q, θ) is the number of correct detections  (retrieved by the system) of the query q with a score greater than or equal to θ.
The only difference between these two approaches is that, in 1-best-WCN phonetic, we index only the 1-best path  extracted from the WCN instead of indexing all the WCN.
It is due to the fact that miss probability is improved by indexing all the  hypotheses provided by the WCNs.
Using a word-based approach for dealing with OOV and hybrid queries affects drastically the performance of the retrieval; precision and recall are null.
4.7 OOV vs. IV query processing We have randomly chosen three sets of queries from the query sets provided by NIST: 50 queries containing only IV terms; 50 queries containing only OOV terms; and 50 hybrid queries containing both IV and OOV terms.
The term-weighted value (TWV) is computed by first computing the miss and false alarm probabilities for each query separately, then  using these and an (arbitrarily chosen) prior probability to compute query-specific values, and finally averaging these query-specific values over all queries q to produce an overall system value: TWV (θ) = 1 − averageq{Pmiss(q, θ) + β × PF A(q, θ)} where β = C V (Pr−1 q − 1).
Miss and false alarm probabilities for a given query q are functions of θ: Pmiss(q, θ) = 1 − Ncorrect(q, θ) Ntrue(q) PF A(q, θ) = Nspurious(q, θ) NNT (q) corpus WER(%) SUBR(%) DELR(%) INSR(%) BNEWS WCN 12.7 49 42 9 CTS WCN 19.6 51 38 11 CONFMTG WCN 47.4 47 49 3 Table 1: WER and distribution of the error types over word 1-best path extracted from WCNs for the different source types.

We measure precision and recall by comparing the results obtained over the automatic transcripts (only the  results having true hard decision) to the results obtained over the reference manual transcripts.
• NNT (q) is the number of opportunities for incorrect detection of the query q in the corpus; it is the  NonTarget query trials.
4.2 WER analysis We use the word error rate (WER) in order to characterize the accuracy of the transcripts.
For the experiments, we have processed the query set provided by NIST that includes 1100 queries.
Using a phone-based approach for dealing with IV queries affects also the performance of the retrieval relatively to the word-based approach.
Testing and determination of empirical values have been achieved on another set of speech data and queries, the development set, also provided by NIST.
Table 1 gives the WER and the distribution of the error types over 1-best path transcripts extracted from WCNs.
We would like to compare three different approaches of retrieval: using only word index; using only phonetic index; combining word and phonetic indices.
Basically, setting a threshold aims to eliminate from the retrieved occurrences, false alarms without adding misses.
We have produced WCNs for the three different source types.
The WER of the 1-best path phonetic transcripts is  approximately two times worse than the WER of word transcripts.
The results returned from the manual transcription for a given query are  considered relevant and are expected to be retrieved with highest scores.
ATWV is the actual term-weighted value; it is the  detection value attained by the system as a result of the system output and the binary decision output for each putative  occurrence.
Tspeech is the total amount of speech in the collection (in  seconds).
Table 6 summarizes the retrieval performance according to each approach and to each type of queries.
WCN phonetic approach was used in the recent NIST STD evaluation and received the highest overall ranking among eleven participants.
Each query is a phrase containing between one to five terms, common and rare terms, terms that are in the manual  transcripts and those that are not.
• Ntrue(q) is the number of true occurrences of the query q in the corpus.
One of the  reasons is the fact that the ASR system is more accurate on long words.

Deletion error rate (DELR) and insertion error rate (INSR) are defined in a similar manner.
4.3 Theta threshold We have determined empirically a detection threshold θ per source type and the hard decision of the occurrences having a score less than θ is set to false; false occurrences returned by the system are not considered as retrieved and therefore, are not used for computing ATWV, precision and recall.
The query set was divided into three different  quantiles according to the duration; we have reported in Table 5 ATWV and MTWV according to the duration.
1-best phonetic transcripts were generated only for BNEWS and CTS, since CONFMTG phonetic transcripts have too low accuracy.
The following experiment has been achieved on the BNEWS collection and IV and OOV terms has been determined according to the vocabulary of BNEWS ASR system.
That is the reason why we have not retrieved from phonetic transcripts on CONFMTG speech data.
Average precision and recall, MTWV and ATWV on the 1100 queries are given in Table 4.
We have adapted Juru [7], a full-text search  library written in Java, to index the transcripts and to store the timestamps of the words and phones; search results have been retrieved as described in Section 3.
• Nspurious(q, θ) is the number of spurious detections of the query q with a score greater than or equal to θ.
The ATWV that we have obtained is close to the MTWV; we have combined our ranking model with appropriate threshold θ to eliminate results with lower score.
Thus, the closer the automatic results to the manual results is, the better the search effectiveness over the automatic transcripts will be.
We have also provided the detection error tradeoff (DET) curve [19] of miss probability (Pmiss) vs. false alarm  probability (PF A).
We can see that we performed better on longer queries.
WCN phonetic was our primary system for the evaluation and 1-best-WCN phonetic was one of our contrastive  systems.

The indexing time includes both audio processing (generation of word and  phonetic transcripts) and building of the searchable indices.
As shown in Section 4.2, these different  collections have different accuracies.
Beside the recall and the precision, we use the evaluation measures defined by NIST for the 2006 STD evaluation [2]: the Actual Term-Weighted Value (ATWV) and the  Maximum Term-Weighted Value (MTWV).
Therefore, the effect of false alarms added by WCNs is reduced.
This approach always outperforms the others and it justifies the fact that we need to combine word and phonetic search. 
For comparison, the system that ranked at the third place, obtained an ATWV of 0.8238 for BNEWS, 0.6652 for CTS and 0.1103 for CONFMTG.
As expected, we can see that MTWV and ATWV decrease in higher WER.
We provide also the DET curve for WCN phonetic approach in Figure 2.
WER is defined as follows: S + D + I N × 100 where N is the total number of words in the corpus, and S, I, and D are the total number of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors, respectively.
The value of the threshold θ per source type is reported in Table 2.

[17] in the context of  spoken document retrieval.
It includes three  different source types in US English: three hours of broadcast news (BNEWS), three hours of conversational telephony speech (CTS) and two hours of conference room meetings (CONFMTG).
Our aim is to evaluate the ability of the suggested retrieval approach to handle  transcribed speech data.
The higher the WER is, the higher the θ threshold should be.

The point that maximizes the TWV, the MTWV, is specified on each curve.
This observation confirms the results shown by Mamou et al.
θ is the detection threshold.
MTWV is the  maximum term-weighted value over the range of all possible values of θ.
This approach for measuring search effectiveness  using manual data as a reference is very common in speech retrieval research [25, 22, 8, 9, 17].
4.1 Experimental setup Our corpus consists of the evaluation set provided by NIST for the STD 2006 evaluation [1].
We have used the IBM research prototype ASR system, described in [26], for transcribing speech data.
We have determined empirically the following values for the boosting vector defined in Section 3.4: Bi = 1 i .

It has been defined by the  following formula: NNT (q) = Tspeech − Ntrue(q).
