The system can deal with all kinds of queries although the phrases that need to combine for the retrieval, information extracted from two different indices, a word index and a phonetic index.
This work studies how vocabulary independent spoken term detection can be performed efficiently over different data sources.
We have shown an improvement in the retrieval performance when using all the WCN and not only the 1-best path and when using phonetic index for search of OOV query terms.
As a future work, we will compare our model for OOV search on phonetic transcripts with a retrieval model based on the edit distance. 
In this paper, we have presented a vocabulary independent model of indexing and search that combines both the approaches.
This approach always outperforms the other approaches using only word index or phonetic index.
The  former suffers from low accuracy and the latter from limited vocabulary of the recognition system.
The scoring of OOV terms is based on the proximity (in time)  between the different phones.
Previously, phonetic-based and word-based approaches have been used for IR on speech data.
The scoring of IV terms is based on information provided by the WCNs.
