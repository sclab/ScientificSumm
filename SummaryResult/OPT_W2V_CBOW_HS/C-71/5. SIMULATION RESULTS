5.1 Number of Groups Formed by MIND and ICQA We set the total in-network node number to different values and let the networks perform MIND and ICQA.
Figure 3 shows the average failure numbers of the resulting groups when different node numbers are set.

It demonstrates that ι is good indicator of redundancy in different networks.

We compare how many events happen at the locations where the quality is less than the requirement s = 0.6 when each resulting group is conducting surveillance work (We call the  number of such events the failure number of group).
We  compare the grouping results with respect to how many groups both algorithms find and how the performance of the resulting groups are.
For each n,  simulations run with several random seeds to generate different networks.
As sensor nodes are with low computational  capacity, there is a tradeoff between the number of such regions and the precision of the resulting coverage quality of the sensing area of a node.
Larger number of such regions results in better  approximation.
To evaluate the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping problem, we build simulation surveillance networks.

Obviously, the larger the number of groups can be formed, the more the redundancy of each group is exploited.
As an example, in case that n = 1500, the results of five  networks are listed in Table 2.
Detailed settings of the simulation networks are shown in Table 1.
5.2 The Performance of the Resulting Groups Although MIND forms more groups than ICQA does, which  implies longer lifetime of the networks, another importance  consideration is how these groups formed by MIND and ICQA perform.
For  evaluating the improvement of coverage quality in ICQA, we sum up all the improvements at each region-center as the total improvement.
In simulation networks, sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a uniform manner in the network area.
We can see that the groups formed by MIND outperform those formed by ICQA because the groups formed by MIND result in lower failure numbers.
In our simulation study, we set this number 12.
We employ MIND and ICQA to group the in-network sensor nodes.
This output shows that an approach like MIND that aim to maximize ι of the resulting topology can exploits redundancy well.
We let 10000 events randomly occur in the network area except the margin.
Results are averaged.
This further demonstrates that MIND is a good approach for sensor-grouping problem.
This is a numerical approximation.
