This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to  select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the  surveillance work of the network area.
This demonstrates a good application of employing ι in  coveragerelated problems.
It is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be working in sleeping mode (i.e., major power-consuming units such as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be shut off) to save energy, and thus to prolong the network lifetime.
In many application scenarios, WSNs are employed to conduct surveillance tasks in adverse, or even worse, in hostile working  environments.
One way to achieve fault tolerance is that a WSN should contain a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node  failures.
We find that the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points serves as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points.
An algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which  redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.
Section 4 investigates the application of ι in this grouping problem.
To explore the effectiveness of employing ι in coverage-related problems, we formulate a  sensorgrouping problem for high-redundancy WSNs.
First, we  introduce a novel index ι for evaluation of point-distribution.
Redundancy should be exploited as much as possible for the set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area [6].
A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of in-situ battery-powered sensor nodes.
With the MIND algorithm we show that locally maximizing ι among each sensor node and its neighbors is a good approach to solve this problem.
Therefore, fault tolerance of a WSN is  critical.
We also introduce another greedy solution called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) for this problem, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate MIND.
The honeycomb structure poses that the coverage efficiency is the best if each point represents a sensor node that is providing surveillance work.
We show that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the  network.
One major problem caused is that sensor nodes are subjected to failures.
Second, we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.
There are many  potential applications of WSNs, including environmental monitoring and surveillance, etc.
If points are moveable, we find that maximizing ι results in a  honeycomb structure.
A WSN can collect the data about physical phenomena of interest [1].
Employing ι in coverage-related problems is thus deemed promising.
We survey related work and formulate a sensor-grouping problem together with a general sensing model in Section 3.
We propose MIND for this problem 1171 and introduce ICQA as a benchmark.
In Section 2, we introduce our point-distribution index ι.
The main contribution of this paper is twofold.
In Section 5, we present our simulation results in which MIND and ICQA are compared.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We call this index, denoted by ι, the normalized minimum distance.
Section 6 provides conclusion remarks.
