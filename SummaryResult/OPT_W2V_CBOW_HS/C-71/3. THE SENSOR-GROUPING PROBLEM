We assume that a sensor node can only be responsible to monitor a circular area centered at the node with a radius equal to R. This is a usual assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.
This issue is usually formulated as how to ensure that an event signal omitted in an arbitrary point in the network area can be  detected by sensor nodes.
Based on this notion, to be more reasonable, researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements: Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes: For a point with physical location L, the point is considered covered by the collaboration of i sensors (denoted by k1, ..., ki) if and only if the following two equations holds [7][10][12].
The major feature of the aforementioned protocols is that they employ online distributed and localized algorithms in which a  sensor node determines its sleeping eligibility and/or sleeping time based on the coverage requirement of its sensing area with some information provided by its neighbors.
3.2 A General Sensing Model As WSNs are usually employed to monitor possible events in a given area, it is therefore a design requirement that an event  occurring in the network area must/may be successfully detected by sensors.
For example, sensor nodes are usually deployed in a random manner and the location of each in-network sensor node is determined only after a node is deployed.
Each set of sensor nodes are able to maintain the required area surveillance work.
Yan et al  introduced a differentiated service in which a sensor node finds out its responsible working duration with cooperation of its neighbors to ensure the coverage of sampled points [17].
The NP-completeness of the problem is proved and a heuristic that computes the sets are proposed.
Given: • The set of each sensor node i"s sensing neighbors N(i) and the location of each member in N(i); • A sensing model which quantitatively describes how a point P in area φ is covered by sensor nodes that are responsible to monitor this point.
Boolean sensing model assumes that a sensor node can always detect an event occurring in its responsible  sensing area.
Specifically, the signal strength E(d) of an event that is received by a sensor node satisfies: E(d) = α dβ (3) where d is the physical distance from the event to the sensor node; α is related to the signal strength omitted by the event; and β is signal fading factor which is typically a positive number larger than or equal to 2.
It is followed by discussion in  Subsection 3.2 on a general sensing model, which serves as a given condition of the sensor-grouping problem formulation.
We consider the probability P(L, kj ) that an event located at L can be detected by sensor kj is related to the signal strength sensed by kj.
We call this quantity the coverage quality of P. • The coverage quality requirement in φ, denoted by s. When the coverage of a point is larger than this threshold, we say this point is covered.
In [5] by Cardei et al, disjoint sensor sets are  modeled as disjoint dominating sets.
∀j = 1, ..., i; L(kj) − L < R. (4) C(L) = iX j=1 (E( L(kj) − L ) > s. (5) C(L) is regarded as the coverage quality of location L in the network area [7][10][12].
The solution of sensor-grouping problem should only base on  locally obtainable information of a sensor node.
It is a greedy algorithm in which the  priority of selecting a given sensor is determined by how many  uncovered regions this sensor covers and the redundancy caused by this sensor.
This is because sensors nodes in this area, together with node i, may be cooperative to ensure the coverage of a point inside node i"s sensing area.
The larger the  distance, the weaker the event signals that can be sensed by the sensor, which results in a reduction of the probability that the event can be successfully detected by the sensor.
The major advantage of this approach is that it avoids the  overhead caused by the processes of coordination of sensor nodes to make decision on whether a sensor node is a candidate to sleep or 1172 work and how long it should sleep or work.
The sensor nodes are scheduled according to which set they belong to.
Therefore, the given conditions can all be easily obtained by a sensor-grouping scheme with fully distributed implementation.
Wang et al designed an approach called Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) which introduced the  notion that the coverage degree of intersection-points of the  neighboring nodes" sensing-perimeters indicates the coverage of a convex region [15].
How to provide this mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper and yet to be explored.
For each sensor node i, make a decision on which group S(j) it should join so that: • Area φ can be covered by sensor nodes in each set S(j) • m, the number of sets S(j) is maximized.
In [13] by Slijepcevic et al, the sensing area is divided into  regions.
But most sensors detect events according to the signal strength sensed.
Obviously, a sensing model is required to address this problem so that how a point in the network area is  covered can be modeled and quantified.
(7) As the detection probability P (L) reasonably determines how an event occurring at location L can be detected by the networks, it is a good measure of the coverage quality of location L in a WSN.
• φ: The area monitored by the network: i.e., the sensing area of the network.
In this formulation, we call sensor nodes within a circular area centered at a sensor node i with a radius equal to 2 · R the sensing neighbors of node i.
It is therefore locally  obtainable information.
Ye et al developed PEAS in which sensor nodes wake up randomly over time, probe their neighboring nodes, and decide whether they should begin to take charge of surveillance work [18].
Event signals usually fade in relation to the  physical distance between an event and the sensor.
The probability that an event located at L can be detected by any collaborative sensors that satisfied Equation (4) is: P (L) = 1 − iY j=1 (1 − P(L, kj )).
Cardei et al also studied similar problem in the domain of covering target points in [4].
We reify this problem with a realistic sensing model in next  subsection.
We assume that the communication range of a sensor node is larger than 2 · R, which is also a general assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.
However, we notice that defining the sensibility as the sum of the sensed signal strength by each collaborative sensor implies a very special application: Applications must employ the sum of the  signal strength to achieve decision-making.
We call this circular area the sensing area of a node.
Specifically, Equation (5) is modified to: C(L) = P (L) = 1 − iY j=1 [1 − δ ( L(kj) − L / + 1)β ] > s. (8) To sum it up, we consider a point at location L is covered if Equation (4) and (8) hold. 
A node sleeping-working schedule scheme is  therefore highly desired to exploit the redundancy of working sensors and let as many nodes as possible sleep.
Thus the coverage quality of a WSN can be evaluated.
Sensor nodes are grouped with the most-constrained  leastconstraining algorithm.
2 Note that if some nodes die, a re-grouping process might also be performed to exploit the remaining nodes in a set of sensor nodes.
Only one set of sensor nodes work at any time.
As in WSNs, event signals are usually electromagnetic, acoustic, or photic signals, they fade exponentially with the increasing of 1173 their transmit distance.
Xing et al exploited a  probabilistic distributed detection model with a protocol called  Coordinating Grid (Co-Grid) [16].
Although maximum dominating sets computation is NP-complete, the authors proposed a  graphcoloring based algorithm.
The approximate location information is obtainable if each sensor node carries a GPS receiver or if some localization algorithms are employed (e.g., [3]).
To capture generally  realistic application requirement, we modify the definition described in Equation (5).
Sensor nodes in a network are divided into several disjoint sets.
Also it is usually infeasible to obtain such  information before sensor nodes are deployed.
In Subsection 3.1, we provide a general problem formulation of the sensor-grouping problem.
The last two given conditions in this problem formulation can be programmed into a node before it is deployed or by a node-programming protocol (e.g., [9]) during network  runtime.
• R: The sensing radius of a sensor node.
These algorithms are centralized solutions of  sensorgrouping problem.
A simple theoretical sensing model is the Boolean sensing model [15][18][17][14].
However, global information (e.g., the location of each in-network sensor node) of a large scale WSN is also very expensive to  obtained online.
Another major approach for sensor node sleeping-working  scheduling issue is to group sensor nodes.
On the contrary, roughly speaking, this approach groups sensor nodes in one time and  schedules when each set of sensor nodes should be on duty.
The model we adopt in this paper is described in details as follows.
We call the issue sensor-grouping problem.
3.1 Problem Formulation We assume that each sensor node can know its approximate  physical location.
In our recent work [7], we also provided a sleeping configuration protocol, namely SSCP, in which sleeping eligibility of a sensor node is determined by a local Voronoi diagram.
Distributed-solution requirement is formulated in this problem.
• n: The number in-network sensor nodes.
Therefore, to fulfill different application  requirements, different sensing models should be constructed based on the characteristics of the sensors employed.
These sets work successively.
Here locally obtainable information refers to a node"s local information and the information that can be directly obtained from its adjacent nodes, i.e., nodes within its communication range.
normalizes the distance to a proper scale and the +1 item is to avoid infinite value of P(L, kj).
Different applications of WSNs employ different types of  sensors, which surely have widely different theoretical and physical characteristics.
Formally, P(L, kj) = γE(d) = δ ( L(kj) − L / + 1)β , (6) where γ is a constant and δ = γα is a constant too.
That is to say, nodes should determine which group they should join in a fully  distributed way.
Much work in the literature is on this issue [6].
To facilitate our discussions, the notations in our following  discussions are described as follows.
Such processes should be performed from time to time during the lifetime of a network in many online distributed and localized algorithms.
It does not require frequent decision-making on working/sleeping eligibility2 .
That is to say, the first given condition in Problem 1 is the information that can be obtained directly from a node"s adjacent nodes.
The large  overhead caused by such processes is the main drawback of the  online distributed and localized algorithms.
In many application scenarios, to achieve fault tolerance, a WSN contains a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node failures.
• S(j) (j = 1, 2, ..., m): The jth set of sensor nodes where m is the number of sets.
SSCP can provide different levels of redundancy to maintain different  requirements of fault tolerance.
Usually, α and β are considered as constants.
• L(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., n): The physical location of node i.
Problem 1.
