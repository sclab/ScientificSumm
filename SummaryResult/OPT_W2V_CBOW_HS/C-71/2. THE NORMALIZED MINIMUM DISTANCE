ι is a very interesting value of a set of points.
In resource-sharing evaluation, the Global Fairness Index (GFI) is often employed to measure how even the resource distributes among these points [8], when xi represents the amount of resource that belong to point i.
An algorithm is implemented to generate the topology in which ι is locally maximized (The algorithm can be found in [19]).
It is exciting to see that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi diagram [2] formed by these nodes (A Vonoroi diagram formed by a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node) is a honeycomb-like structure1 .
It is calculated by: ι = min(||xi − xj||) µ (∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n; and i = j) (1) where ||xi − xj|| denotes the Euclidean distance between point i and point j in Ω, the min(·) function calculates the minimum distance between each pair of points, and µ is the average distance between each pair of points, which is: µ = ( Pn i=1 Pn j=1,j=i ||xi − xj||) n(n − 1) (2) ι measures how well the points separate from one another.
Under the constraint that the sensing area should be covered, the more each node separates from the others, the less the redundancy of the coverage is.
ι is equal to 1 if and only if n is equal to 3 and these three points forms an equilateral triangle.
We propose a novel index called the normalized minimum distance, namely ι, to evaluate the distribution of the points.
In order to avoid that the algorithm converge to local optimum, we select different random seeds to generate the initial points for 1000 time and obtain the best one that results in the largest ι when the algorithm converges.

It may be necessary to evaluate how the distribution of these points is.
ι is equal to zero if any two points overlap.
In WSNs, GFI is usually used to calculate how even the remaining energy of sensor nodes is.
ι: A POINT-DISTRIBUTION INDEX Suppose there are n points in a Euclidean space Ω.
For  example, the Mean Square Error from these points to their mean value can be employed to calculate how these points deviate from their mean (i.e., their central).
ι indicates the quality of such separation.
ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points.
If the sensor  coverage model is the Boolean coverage model [15][17][18][14] and the coverage radius of each node is the same.
If we consider each xi (∀i = 1, ..., n) is a variable in Ω, how these n points would look like if ι is maximized?
Suppose each point represents a sensor node.
This enlightens us that ι may be employed to solve problems related to sensor-coverage of an area.
Obviously, ι is in interval [0, 1].
In our following discussions, we will show the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping problem. 
There are many metrics to achieve this goal.
When n is larger than 2 and the points do not all overlap (That points all overlap means xi = xj, ∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n).
In WSNs, it is desirable 1 This is how base stations of a wireless cellular network are  deployed and why such a network is called a cellular one.
Figure 1 demonstrates what the resulting topology looks like when n = 20 as an example.
We consider a 2-dimensional space.
The  coordinates of these points are denoted by xi (i = 1, ..., n).
It should be useful for approaches on sensor-coverage related problems.
We select n = 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 and perform this algorithm.
