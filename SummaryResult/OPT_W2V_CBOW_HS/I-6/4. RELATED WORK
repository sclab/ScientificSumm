However, their approach does not use an explicit notion of commitments which in our framework mediates between communication and behaviour-based grounding, and provides a clear  distinction between a normative notion of compliance and a more empirical notion of expectation.
In this area, [16] is the only framework that we are aware of which considers dynamic obligations, norms and sanctions.
when some initial transitions are possible in principle 106 The Sixth Intl.
Like [1] (which bases the notion of publicly expressed on roles rather than internal states of agents) these authors" main concern is to provide a verifiable basis for determining the semantics of expressed mental states and commitments.
However, as we have described above we solely utilise semantic evolution as a sanctioning and rewarding mechanism, i.e.
The same authors suggested a more general framework for expectation-based communication  semantics [9], and argue for a consequentialist view of  semantics that is based on defining the meaning of utterances in terms of their expected consequences and updating these expectations with new observations [11].
different protocols for different phases of market-based interaction) whereas we focus on different semantic variants that are to be used in the same interaction context. 
Finally, the FSM-like structure of the DS transition  systems in combination with agent communication is  reminiscent of work on electronic institutions [5], but there the focus is on providing different means of communication in different scenes of the interaction process (e.g.
Expectation-based reasoning about interaction was first proposed in [2], considering the evolution of expectations described as probabilistic expectations of communication and action sequences.
11 In a non-trivial sense, i.e.
unlike this work we do not assume that agents can be directly punished or rewarded.
Though our framework is only concerned with commitment to the achievement of states of affairs rather than exchanged information, in a sense, DS provides an alternative view by specifying what will happen if the assumptions on which what is publicly accepted is based are violated.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Our framework is also related to deontic methods for the specification of obligations, norms and sanctions.
Grounding for (mentalistic) ACL semantics has been  investigated in [7] where grounded information is viewed as information that is publicly expressed and accepted as  being true by all the agents participating in a conversation.
