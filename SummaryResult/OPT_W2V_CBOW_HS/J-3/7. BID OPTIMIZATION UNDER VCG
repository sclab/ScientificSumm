Observation 1 still holds, and we can construct a landscape as before, where each landscape point corresponds to a  particular bid b[i].
We claim that in the VCG auction, the landscapes are  convex.
For the sake of the budget optimization problem we can define VCG by just redefining costq(b) (replacing Equation (2)): costq(b) = p−1 X j=i (α[j] − α[j + 1]) · b[j] where i = pos(b).
But, the equation above shows that each piece has its  incremental cpc equal to the bid that achieves it; thus in the case of VCG the pieces are also sorted by bid.
Now consider running the algorithm described in  Section 2.1.4 for finding the optimal bids for a set of queries.
Hence we can obtain any prefix of the pieces via a uniform bid on all the  keywords.
We conclude that the best uniform bid is an optimal solution to the budget optimization problem. 
Since b[i] ≥ b[i + 1], the slopes of the pieces of the  landscape decrease, and we get that the curve is convex.
In this section we argue that the budget optimization problem is easy under the VCG auction.
In this algorithm we took all the pieces from the landscape curves, sorted them by incremental cpc, then took a prefix of those pieces, giving us bids for each of the queries.
The slope of line segment between the points corresponding to those two positions is cost(b[i]) − cost(b[i + 1]) clicks(b[i]) − clicks(b[i + 1]) = (α[i] − α[i + 1]) · b[i] α[i] − α[i + 1] = b[i].
The GSP auction is not the only possible auction one could use for sponsored search.
To see this, consider two consecutive positions i,i + 1.
For a full definition of VCG and its application to  sponsored search we refer the reader to [1, 2, 5].
Indeed the VCG auction and variants [14, 4, 7, 1] offer alternatives with compelling game-theoretic properties.
