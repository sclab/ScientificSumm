When a user poses a search query, the Internet search company determines the advertisers whose keywords match the query and who still have budget left over, runs an auction amongst them, and presents the set of ads corresponding to the advertisers who win the auction.
It is a challenging problem to set up the auction in order to effect a stable market in which all the parties (the advertisers, users as well as the Internet search company) are adequately  satisfied.
Still, this is a complex problem for the following reasons (among others): • Individual keywords have significantly different  characteristics from each other; e.g., while fishing is a broad keyword that matches many user queries and has many competing advertisers, humane fishing bait is a niche keyword that matches only a few queries, but might have less competition.
The results of these simulations, which are highlighted at the end of Section 4, suggest that uniform bidding strategies could be useful in practice.
Even for the simple case when the graph is a matching, the optimal algorithm involves  placing different bids on different keywords via a knapsack-like packing (Section 2).
While we can cast this problem as a traditional  optimization problem, there are different challenges in practice  depending on the advertiser"s access to the query and graph information, and indeed the reliability of this information (e.g., it could be based on unstable historical data).
The focus in this paper is on how the advertisers bid.
Since this type of strategy obviates the need to know anything about the particulars of the graph, and effectively aggregates the click and cost functions on the queries, it is quite robust, and thus  desirable in practice.
For each query q ∈ Q, there are functions giving the clicksq(b) and costq(b) that result from bidding a particular amount b in the auction for that query, which we model more formally in the next section.
In fact, our proof is stronger, showing that this strategy is 63% effective against a strictly more  powerful adversary who can bid independently on the individual queries, i.e., not be constrained by the interaction imposed by the graph G. Our proof of the 1 − 1/e approximation ratio relies on an adversarial analysis.
Given graph G together with the functions clicksq(·) and costq(·) on the queries, as well as a budget U, determine the bids bk for each keyword k ∈ K such that P q clicksq(bq) is  maximized subject to P q costq(bq) ≤ U, where the effective bid bq on a query is some function of the keyword bids in the neighborhood of q.
For the particular choice of keywords of their interest1 , an advertiser wants to optimize the overall effect of the  advertising campaign.
2 The particulars of the matching rule are determined by the Internet search company; here we treat the function as arbitrary.
• There are complex interactions between keywords  because a user query may match two or more keywords, since the advertiser is trying to cover all the possible keywords in some domain.
In this paper we define the notion of a uniform strategy which is essentially a strategy that bids uniformly on all keywords.
Thus it is important to find solutions to this problem that not only get many clicks, but are also simple, robust and less  reliant on the information.
In particular, we show: • Nearly all formulations of the problem are NP-Hard.
For any query q ∈ Q, the neighbors of q in K are the keywords that are said to match the query q.2 The budget optimization problem is as follows.
The advertiser determines a set of keywords of their interest and then must create ads, set the bids for each keyword, and provide a total (often daily) budget.
Uniform strategies may appear to be naive in first  consideration because the keywords vary significantly in their click and cost functions, and there may be complex  interaction between them when multiple keywords are relevant to a query.
As a result, the advertisers face a challenging optimization problem.
The strategy found by the algorithm is a two-bid uniform strategy, which means that it  randomizes between bidding some value b1 on all keywords, and  bidding some other value b2 on all keywords until the budget is exhausted3 .
While the effect of an ad campaign in any medium is a complicated phenomenon to quantify, one commonly accepted (and easily quantified) notion in  searchbased advertising on the Internet is to maximize the number of clicks.
In cases slightly more general than the formulation above, where the clicks have weights, the problem is inapproximable  better than a factor of 1 − 1 e , unless P=NP.
So, it might be surprising that a simple two-bid uniform strategy is 63% or more effective compared to the optimum.
The challenge from an advertiser"s point of view is to understand and interact with the auction mechanism.
There is a set K of keywords of interest; in practice, even small advertisers typically have a large set K. There is a set Q of queries posed by the users.
After all, the optimum can configure arbitrary bids on each of the keywords.
In contrast, Internet search companies find it difficult to set a price explicitly for the advertisements they place in response to user queries.
A given advertiser sees the state of the auctions for  searchbased advertising as follows.
What is surprising is that uniform strategy actually performs well, which we will prove.
The perspective in this paper is not of the Internet search company that displays the advertisements, but rather of the advertisers.
Thus, they rely on the market to determine suitable prices by  using auctions amongst the advertisers.
• We give a (1−1/e)-approximation algorithm for the budget optimization problem.
Internet search companies provide the advertisers with  summaries of the query traffic which is useful for them to  optimize their keyword choices interactively.
1.1 The Budget Optimization Problem We present a short discussion and formulation of the  optimization problem faced by advertisers; a more detailed description is in Section 2.
We also give a (1/2)-approximation algorithm that offers a single-bid uniform strategy, only  using one value b1.
By deriving the optimal solution to this LP, we obtain both the proof of the approximation ratio, and a tight worst-case instance.
The Internet search companies are supportive  to1 The choice of keywords is related to the domain-knowledge of the advertiser, user behavior and strategic considerations.
We do not directly address the choice of keywords in this paper, which is  addressed elsewhere [13].
We define a factor-revealing LP  (Section 4) where primal solutions correspond to possible  instances, and dual solutions correspond to distributions over bidding strategies.
This difficulty arises because supply (and demand) varies widely and unpredictably across the user queries, and they must price slots for billions of such queries in real time.
However,  important questions remain about (among other things)  alternate bidding goals, on-line or stochastic bidding models [11], and game-theoretic concerns [3], which we briefly discuss in Section 8. 
We show that this approximation ratio is tight for uniform strategies.
and MSN let companies and individuals advertise based on search queries posed by users.
In effect the advertiser ends up competing with herself.
These strategies can be computed in time nearly linear in |Q| + |K|, the input size.
The advertiser whose ad appears pays the Internet search company if the user clicks on the ad.
1.2 Our Main Results and Technical Overview We present positive and negative results for the budget optimization problem.
There is a bipartite graph G on the two vertex sets representing K and Q.
40 wards advertisers and provide statistics about the history of click volumes and prediction about the future performance of various keywords.
The focus of this paper is to solve this optimization problem.
(This is tight for single-bid uniform  strategies.)
We have conducted simulations using real auction data from Google.
Recently there has been systematic study of the issues involved in the game theory of the auctions [5, 1, 2], revenue maximization [10], etc.
Conventional media outlets, such as TV stations or  newspapers, price their ad slots individually, and the advertisers buy the ones they can afford.
Online search is now ubiquitous and Internet search  companies such as Google, Yahoo!
