For any possible bid b, if we use the aggregate landscape just as we would a regular landscape, we exactly represent the cost and clicks associated with making that bid  simultaneously on all queries associated with the aggregate  landscape.
Define a two-bid strategy to be a uniform strategy which puts non-zero weight on at most two bid vectors.
Given an instance of Budget Optimization in which there are a total of N points in all the landscapes, we can find the best uniform strategy in O(N log N) time.
Output the strategy which is the appropriate convex combination of the uniform bid vectors corresponding to α and β.
The best single-bid strategy can also be computed easily from the aggregate landscape.
Third, any algorithm that gives an approximation guarantee will then be valid for any interaction graph over those keywords and queries.
The ith point in our aggregate landscape V is found by summing, over the queries, the cost and clicks associated with bid bi, that is, V = ∪N i=1( P q∈Q costq(bi), P q∈Q clicksq(bi)).
In this case, the advertiser would simply bid b∗ until her budget runs out, and the ad serving system would remove her from all subsequent auctions until the end of the day.
Therefore, all the definitions and results of Section 2 about landscapes can be extended to aggregate landscapes, and we can apply Lemma 1 to compute the best uniform strategy (using the convex hull of the points in this  aggregate landscape).

We will also consider a special case of two-bid strategies.
The resulting strategy is the convex combination of two points on the aggregate landscape.
We define a uniform bidding strategy to be a distribution A over bid vectors a ∈ R |K| + where each bid vector in the distribution is of the form (b, b, .
In other words, each vector in the distribution bids the same value on every keyword.
Putting these ideas together, we get an O(N log N)-time algorithm for Budget Optimization, where N is the total number of landscape points (we later show that this is a (1 − 1 e )-approximation algorithm): 1.
Compute the point on the convex hull for the given budget, which is the convex combination of two points α and β.
A single-bid strategy is a uniform strategy which puts  nonzero weight on at most one non-zero vector, i.e.
We now show that we can compute the best uniform  strategy efficiently.
advertiser randomizes between bidding a certain amount b∗ on all  keywords, and not bidding at all.
Suppose we have a set of queries Q, where the landscape Vq for each query q is defined by the set of points Vq = {(costq[1], αq[1]), .
In  addition, it may be difficult to reason about strategies that involve arbitrary distributions over arbitrary bid vectors.
The optimal strategy for a budget U will either be the point x s.t.
Find the convex hull of the points in the aggregate landscape.
We define the set of interesting bids Iq = {costq[1]/αq [1], .
With this motivation, we look at restricted classes of strategies that we can easily compute, explain and analyze.
Aggregate all the points from the individual query  landscapes into a single aggregate landscape.
cost(x) is as large as possible without exceeding U, or a convex  combination of zero and the point y, where cost(y) is as small as possible while larger than U.
Second, uniform strategies are also independent of the priority rule being used.
First, they do not depend on the edges of the interaction graph, since all effective bids on queries are the same.
The running time is dominated by the time to compute the convex hull, which is O(N log N)[12].
Furthermore, this strategy will always be a two-bid strategy.
As we will show in Section 5, solving the Budget  Optimization problem in its full generality is difficult.
A single-bid strategy is even easier to implement in practice than a two-bid strategy.
For example, the search engines often allow advertisers to set a maximum daily budget.
, b) for some real-valued bid b.
Advertisers generally prefer strategies that are easy to  understand, evaluate and use within their larger goals.
We can index the points in I as b1, .
Uniform strategies have several advantages.
One could also use an ad scheduling tool offered by some search companies8 to implement this strategy.
Thus, they are effective in the face of limited or noisy information about the keyword interaction graph.

We have shown Lemma 2.
