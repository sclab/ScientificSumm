Examples of this approach are queuing in first-come, first-served (FCFS) order, queueing using the  resource consumption of tasks (e.g., [28]), and scheduling  using combinatorial optimization [19].
There are two main groups of related work in resource allocation: those that incorporate an economic mechanism, and those that do not.
Their  methodology follows the study of congestion (potential) games [17, 22] by relating the Nash equilibrium to the solution of a (usually convex) global optimization problem.
uses a reservation abstraction similar to the way airline seats are allocated.
There have been several analyses [10, 11, 12, 13, 23] of variations of price-anticipating allocation schemes in the  context of allocation of network capacity for flows.
Unfortunately, reservations have a high latency to acquire resources, unlike the price-anticipating scheme we consider.
Milchtaich [16] studied congestion games with private preferences but the technique in [16] is specific to the congestion game. 
We view scheduling and resource allocation as two separate functions.
SHARE allocates resources using a centralized combinatorial auction that allows users to express preferences with  complementarities.
Examples of the economic approach are Spawn [26]), work by Stoica, et al.
But those techniques no longer apply to our game because we model users as having fixed budgets and private preferences for machines.
One non-economic approach is scheduling (surveyed by Pinedo [20]).
Resource allocation divides a resource among different users while scheduling takes a given  allocation and orders a user"s jobs.
For example, unlike those games, there may  exist multiple Nash equilibria in our game.
Solving the NP-complete combinatorial auction  problem provides an optimally efficient allocation.
[24]., the Millennium resource allocator [4], work by Wellman, et al.
These all assume that the values and resource consumption of tasks are reported accurately, which does not apply in the presence of strategic users.
Bellagio[3] uses the SHARE centralized allocator.
The tradeoff of the price-anticipating schemes is that users have uncertainty about exactly how much of the resources they will receive.
The  priceanticipating scheme that we consider does not explicitly  operate on complementarities, thereby possibly losing some  efficiency, but it also avoids the complexity and overhead of combinatorial auctions.
