Contextual advertising usually falls into the category of  direct marketing (as opposed to brand advertising), that is advertising whose aim is a direct response where the  effect of an campaign is measured by the user reaction.
• The ad network is a mediator between the advertiser and the publisher and selects the ads that are put on the pages.
However, for simplicity we ignore the pricing model and concentrate on finding ads that will maximize the first term of the product, that is we search for arg max i P(click|p, ai) Furthermore we assume that the probability of click for a given ad and page is determined by its relevance score with respect to the page, thus ignoring the positional effect of the ad placement on the page.
However, it is a concise description of target ad audience as determined by the advertiser and it has been shown to be an important feature for successful CM ad placement [8].
The revenue of the network, given a page p, can be estimated as: R = X i=1..k P(click|p, ai)price(ai, i) where k is the number of ads displayed on page p and price(ai, i) is the click-price of the current ad ai at position i.
In most networks, the amount paid by the advertiser for each SS click is determined by an auction process where the advertisers place bids on a search phrase, and their  position in the tower of ads displayed in conjunction with the result is determined by their bid.
As in traditional advertising, the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as the promotion of products or services.
ADVERTISING Contextual advertising is an interplay of four players: • The publisher is the owner of the web pages on which the advertising is displayed.
The ad-network model aligns the interests of the  publishers, advertisers and the network.
In general, clicks bring benefits to both the publisher and the ad network by  providing revenue, and to the advertiser by bringing traffic to the target web site.
In addition to the bid phrase, an ad is also characterized by a title usually displayed in a bold font, and an abstract or creative, which is the few lines of text, usually less than 120 characters, displayed on the page.
The price in this model depends on the set of ads presented on the page.
Usually the desired immediate reaction is for the user to follow the link in the ad and visit the advertiser"s web site and, as noted, the prevalent financial model is that the advertiser pays a certain amount for every click on the advertisement (PPC).
• The advertiser provides the supply of ads.
Context match advertising has grown from Sponsored Search advertising, which consists in placing ads on the result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query.
One of the advantages of online advertising in general and  contextual advertising in particular is that, compared to the traditional media, it is relatively easy to measure the user response.
• Users visit the web pages of the publisher and interact with the ads.
Usually the activity of the advertisers are organized around campaigns which are defined by a set of ads with a  particular temporal and thematic goal (e.g.
The publisher typically aims to maximize advertising revenue while providing a good user experience.
The ad-network shares the advertisement revenue with the publisher.
Thus each ad is  annotated with one or more bid phrases.
The bid phrase has no direct bearing on the ad placement in CM.
The revenue is shared between the publisher and the network.
Several models have been proposed to determine the price, most of them based on generalizations of second price auctions.
We assume that this is an orthogonal factor to the relevance component and could be easily incorporated in the model.
