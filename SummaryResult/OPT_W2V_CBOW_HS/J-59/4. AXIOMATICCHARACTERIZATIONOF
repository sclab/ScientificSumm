By ECB and Lemma 4 the cost share of job i + 1 in any allocation rule in ψ must be πi+1 = pi+1θi+1 + 1 2 ¡£j<i+1 pjθi+1¢.
An implication of Pareto indifference axiom and Lemma 2 is that for every efficient ordering there is some set of transfers of jobs such that it is part of an efficient rule and the cost share of a job in all these allocations are same.
Consider any job i, in an efficient ordering σ, if we increase the value of γj for some j = i such that σj > σi, then the set Pi ( preceding jobs) does not change in the new efficient ordering.
Using this argument for every i ∈ N and using the expression for the Shapley value in Lemma 3, we get the Shapley value rule.
The following statements are equivalent: 1) For each q ∈ Q, ψ(q) selects all the allocation assigning jobs cost shares implied by the Shapley value.
As in the proof of Proposition 1, define θi j = γipj ∀ i, j ∈ N. Assume without loss of generality that σ is an efficient ordering with σi = i ∀ i ∈ N. Consider a queue with jobs in set K = {1, .
In that case, the expected cost inflicted by a job i on another job j in the allocation rule can be  calculated.
The next proposition shows that the Shapley value rule satisfies all the fairness axioms discussed.
The Shapley value satisfies ECB by its expression in Lemma 3.
A direct consequence of ECB is the following lemma.
An analogous fairness axiom results if we remove the job from the beginning of the queue.
Any efficient rule ψ that satisfies ECB, IFJp, and PRθ is a rule implied by the Shapley value rule.
In q = (K \ {i + 1}, p, θ ), we can calculate the cost share of job i using ECB and Lemma 4 as πi = piθi + 1 2 £j<i pjθi.
If an efficient rule chooses σ such that σi < σj for some i, j ∈ N, then job i is inflicting a cost of piθj on job j and job j is inflicting zero cost on job i.
Using Lemma 4, we get cost share of i from (σ, t ) as πi = piθi + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢.
An allocation rule ψ satisfies equal  treatment of equals (ETE) if for all q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), i, j ∈ N, then ¡pi = pj; θi = θj¢⇒ ¡πi = πj¢.
If (p, θ) values of no other jobs are changed, then the Shapley value is unchanged by increasing γj for some j ∈ Pi while keeping pj unchanged.
But it is silent about the cost shares of two jobs i and j which satisfy θi pi = θj pj .
An allocation rule satisfies expected cost bound (ECB) if for all q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q) with π being the resulting cost share, for any γ ≥ 0, and for every i ∈ S(γ), we have πi ≥ piθi + 1 2 ¡   j∈S(γ):σj <σi pjθi +   j∈S(γ):σj >σi piθj¢.
An allocation rule ψ satisfies independence of preceding jobs" θ (IPJθ) if for all q = (N, p, θ), q = (N, p , θ ) ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), (σ , t ) ∈ ψ(q ), if for all i ∈ N \ {k}: θi = θi, pi = pi and γk < γk, pk = pk, then for all j ∈ N such that σj > σk: πj = πj, where π is the cost share in (σ, t) and π is the cost share in (σ , t ).
An allocation rule ψ satisfies anonymity if for all q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q) and every permutation ρ, we then ρ(σ, t) ∈ ψ(N, ρ(q)).
An allocation rule ψ satisfies  proportionate responsibility of θ (PRθ) if for all q ∈ Q, for all (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), k ∈ N such that σk = 1, q = (N \{k}, p , θ ) ∈ Q, such that for all i ∈ N \{k}: θi = θi, pi = pi, there exists (σ , t ) ∈ ψ(q ) such that for all i ∈ N \ {k}: σi = σi and ti = ti + tk θi £j=k θj .
Assume without loss of generality that σ is an efficient ordering with σi = i ∀ i ∈ N. Consider the following q = (N, p , θ ) corresponding to job i with pj = pj if j ≤ i and pj = pi j if j > i, θj = θi j if j < i and θj = θj if j ≥ i.
From ECB, we get πi ≥ piθi+1 2 ¡Li+Ri¢∀ i ∈ N. Assume for contradiction that there exists j ∈ N such that πj > pjθj + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢.
Denote ρ : N → N as a permutation of elements in N. Let ρ(σ, t) denote the allocation obtained by permuting elements in σ and t according to ρ.
An allocation rule ψ satisfies Pareto  indifference if for every q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), and (σ , t ) ∈ Σ(q), we have ¡πi = πi ∀ i ∈ N¢⇒ ¡(σ , t ) ∈ ψ(q)¢.
, i, i + 1}, where i < n. Define q = (K, p, θ ), where θj = θi+1 j ∀ j ∈ K. Define σj = σj ∀ j ∈ K. σ is an efficient ordering for q .
, n. Now, the Shapley value of job i is 236 SVi = piθi + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢(From Lemma 3) = pjθj + 1 2 ¡Lj + Rj¢− 1 2 ¡Li − Lj + Ri − Rj¢ = SVj − 1 2 ¡   i<k≤j piθk −   i≤k<j pkθi¢ = SVj − 1 2   i<k≤j (piθk − pkθi) (Using pi = pj and θi = θj) = SVj (Using θk pk = θi pi for all i ≤ k ≤ j).
Now, ti = 1 2 ¡θi   j<i pj − pi   j>i θj¢ = 1 2 ¡θi   j<i pj − pi   j>i:j=n θj¢− 1 2 piθn = ti − 1 2 θn   j<n pj pi £j<n pj = ti − tn pi £j<n pj .
Also,  contrast to Proposition 2, we consider K = {i, i + 1, .
This gives us the Shapley values of jobs i through n. Setting i = 1, we get cost shares of all the jobs from ψ as the Shapley value.
Any efficient rule ψ that satisfies ECB, IPJθ, and PRp is a rule implied by the Shapley value rule.
Next, we introduce an axiom about sharing the transfer of a job between a set of jobs.
Applying this procedure for every j < i with IPJθ and for every j > i with IFJp, we reach q = (N, p, θ) and the payoff of i does not change from πi.
234 The second axiom related to efficiency says that the  allocation rule should not discriminate between two allocations which are equivalent to each other in terms of cost shares of jobs.
σ remains an efficient ordering in q and by IPJθ the cost share of i + 1 remains πi+1.
So, we add the cost  components of preceding jobs to the cost share of jobs in each iteration and converge to the Shapley value rule.
Using PRp we get the new cost share of job i in the new queue as πi = piθi + 1 2 ¡£j<i pjθi + piθi+1 + piθi+2¢.
For a q ∈ Q if S(γ) = N, then for any (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q) which gives a cost share of π, πi = piθi + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢∀ i ∈ N. Proof.
An allocation rule ψ satisfies independence of following jobs" p (IFJp) if for all q = (N, p, θ), q = (N, p , θ ) ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), (σ , t ) ∈ ψ(q ), if for all i ∈ N \ {k}: θi = θi, pi = pi and γk > γk, θk = θk, then for all j ∈ N such that σj < σk: πj = πj, where π is the cost share in (σ, t) and π is the cost share in (σ , t ).
THE SHAPLEY VALUE In this section, we will define serveral axioms on fairness and characterize the Shapley value using them.
Similarly, for any job j > i, if we change pj to pj without changing θj, the new γ of j is γj ≤ γi.
An allocation rule ψ satisfies  proportionate responsibility of p (PRp) if for all q ∈ Q, for all (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), k ∈ N such that σk = |N|, q = (N \ {k}, p , θ ) ∈ Q, such that for all i ∈ N\{k}: θi = θi, pi = pi, there exists (σ , t ) ∈ ψ(q ) such that for all i ∈ N \ {k}: σi = σi and ti = ti + tk pi £j=k pj .
Using efficiency and the fact that £i∈N Li = £i∈N Ri, we get £i∈N πi = C(N) > £i∈N piθi + 1 2 £i∈N ¡Li + Ri¢ = C(N).
So, using PRp we get the new cost share of job i in q as πi = πi + ti+1 pi j<i+1 pj = piθi + 1 2 ¡£j<i pjθi + piθi+1¢.
For ETE, consider two jobs i, j ∈ N such that pi = pj and θi = θj.
We start with a well known equity axiom called anonymity.
Similarly, let ρ(p, θ) denote the new list of (p, θ) obtained by permuting elements of p and θ according to ρ.
Arguing for every pair of jobs i, j ∈ S(γ), we establish a bound on the cost share of jobs in S(γ).
Also, we will denote the cost share vector associated with an allocation rule (σ, t) as π and that with allocation rule (σ , t ) as π etc.
This implies that if all the jobs are of same type, then jobs should equally share the total system cost.
Any efficient rule ψ that satisfies ECB, IPJθ, and IFJp is a rule implied by the Shapley value rule.
The Shapley value rule chooses an efficient  ordering and by definition the payments add upto zero.
For PRp, assume without loss of generality that jobs are ordered 1, .
The next equity axiom is classical in literature and says that two similar jobs should be compensated such that their cost shares are equal.
The Shapley value assigns same cost share to a job  irrespective of the efficient ordering chosen.
An allocation rule ψ satisfies efficiency if for every q ∈ Q and (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), (σ, t) is an efficient  allocation.
The central idea behind this axiom is that of expected cost inflicted.
Now, for any j < i, if we change θj to θj without changing processing time, the new γ of j is γj ≥ γi.
This process can be repeated till we add job n at which point cost share of i is piθi + 1 2 ¡£j<i pjθi + £j>i piθj¢.
This gives us two independence axioms.
Now, consider q = (K, p, θ ) such that θj = θi j ∀ j ≤ i and θi+1 = θi+1.
Then, we can adjust the θ of preceding jobs of i to their original value and applying IPJθ, the payoffs of jobs i through n will not change.
By Lemma 2 and efficiency, (σ, t ) ∈ ψ(q ) for some set of transfers t .
Our first equity axiom states that allocation rules should be immune to such permutation of data.
Let ψ be an efficient rule which satisfies ECB.
It is possible to replace one of the independence axioms with an equity axiom on sharing the transfer of a job.
Applying IFJp, the cost share of job i should not change.
Similarly, the waiting cost inflicted by a job to its following jobs is independent of the processing times of the following jobs.
Efficiency Axioms We define two types of efficiency axioms.
The expected cost i inflicts on j is 1 2 piθj and j inflicts on i is 1 2 pjθi.
We impose this as an equity axiom below.
If γj is changed such that pj remains the same, then the expression £j∈Pi θipj is unchanged.
Define for any i, j ∈ N, θi j = γipj and pi j = θj γi .
As before, we can find cost share of i + 2 in this queue as πi+2 = pi+2θi+2 + 1 2 ¡£j<i+2 pjθi+2¢.
Applying IPJθ, the cost share of job i should not change.
Our next fairness axiom says that i and j should each be responsible for their own processing cost and this expected cost they inflict on each other.
For a given q ∈ Q, we will denote ψ(q) as the set of allocations from allocation rule ψ.
4.1 The Fairness Axioms We will define three types of fairness axioms: (i) related to efficiency, (ii) related to equity, and (iii) related to  independence.
Our axiom says that the cost share of a job should be at least its own processing cost and the total expected cost it inflicts on others.
Denote the transfer of job i = n due to the Shapley value with set of jobs N and set of jobs N \ {n} as ti and ti respectively.
We introduce a new axiom for this.
Thus, the Shapley value rule satisfies IPJθ.
Equity Axioms How should the cost be shared between two jobs if the jobs have some kind of similarity between them?
Analogous to the proof of  Proposition 2, θs are kept equal to original data and processing times are initialized to pi+1 j .
One related to efficiency which states that an efficient ordering should be selected and the transfers of jobs should add up to zero (budget balance).
The proportionate responsibility axioms are  generalizations of equal responsibility axioms introduced by  Maniquet [15].
Since the presence of the first job influenced each job depending on their θ values, its transfer needs to be shared in proportion to θ values.
Define for some γ ≥ 0, S(γ) = {i ∈ N : γi = γ}.
All our characterizations involve efficiency and ECB.
Observe that all jobs have the same γ: γi.
In an efficient rule, the elements in S(γ) can be ordered in any manner (in |S(γ)|!
Transfer of last job is tn = 1 2 θn £j<n pj.
The Shapley value is anonymous because the particular index of a job does not effect his ordering or cost share.
A similar argument shows that the Shapley value rule  satisfies PRθ.
Also observe that if S(γ) contains just one job, ECB says that job should at least bear its own processing cost.
4.2 The Characterization Results Having stated the fairness axioms, we propose three  different ways to characterize the Shapley value rule using these axioms.
Probability of σi < σj is 1 2 and so is the probability of σi > σj.
This gives us a contradiction.
If an allocation rule chooses multiple  allocations, we can assign equal probabilities of selecting one of the allocations.
Let ψ be an allocation rule.
, n} and repeatedly add jobs to the beginning of the queue  maintaining the same efficient ordering.
Some of these axioms (for example anonymity, equal treatment of equals) are standard in the literature, while some are new.
235 Independence Axioms The waiting cost of a job does not depend on the per unit waiting cost of its preceding jobs.
An analogous argument shows that the Shapley value rule satisfies IFJp.
The proof mirrors the proof of Proposition 2.
But the transfer to the last job needs to be shared between the other jobs.
These independence properties should be carried over to the cost sharing rules.
2) ψ satisfies efficiency, ECB, IFJp, and IPJθ.
In particular, if the last job quits the system, then the ordering need not change.
ETE directs us to share costs equally between jobs if they are of the same per unit waiting cost and processing time.
The proof follows from Propositions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
The Shapley value rule satisfies efficiency, pareto indifference, anonymity, ETE, ECB, IPJθ, IFJp, PRp, and PRθ.
This should be done in proportion to their processing times because every job influenced the last job based on its processing time.
Similarly if we have IFJp, we either need IPJθ or PRθ.
If i, j ∈ S(γ) then we have pjθi = piθj.
Note that the above bound poses no constraints on how the costs are shared among different groups.
3) ψ satisfies efficiency, ECB, IFJp, and PRθ.
Equity axioms provide us with fairness properties which help us answer this question.
, n in an efficient ordering.
4) ψ satisfies efficiency, ECB, PRp, and IPJθ.
Now, we can set K = K ∪ {i + 2}.
We provide five such axioms.
But if we have IPJθ, we either need IFJp or PRp.
Without loss of generality assume the efficient ordering to be 1, .
So, it is pareto indifferent.
So, it satisfies efficiency.
