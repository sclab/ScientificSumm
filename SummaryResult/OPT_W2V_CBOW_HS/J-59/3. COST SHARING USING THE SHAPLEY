Formally, the cost of a coalition S ⊆ N is, C(S) =   i∈S   j∈S:σ∗ j ≤σ∗ i θjpj, where σ∗ = σ∗ (S) is an efficient ordering considering jobs from S only.
Now, ∆(S) = C(S) −   T S ∆(T) = C(S) −   i∈S   j∈S:j<i ∆({i, j}) −   i∈S ∆({i}) = C(S) −   i∈S   j∈S:j<i pjθi −   i∈S piθi = C(S) − C(S) = 0.
For |S| = 3, let S = {i, j, k}.
Given a queue q ∈ Q, the cost of a coalition of S ⊆ N jobs in the queue is defined as the cost incurred by jobs in S if these are the only jobs served in the queue using an efficient ordering.
Let σ∗ be an efficient ordering of jobs in set N. For all i ∈ N, the Shapley value is given by, SVi = piθi + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢, where Li = θi £j∈Pi(σ∗) pj and Ri = pi £j∈Fi(σ∗) θj.
Using the Shapley value formula now, SVi =   S⊆N:i∈S ∆(S) |S| = ∆({i}) + 1 2   j∈N:j=i ∆({i, j}) = piθi + 1 2 ¡  j<i ∆({i, j}) +   j>i ∆({i, j})¢ = piθi + 1 2 ¡  j<i pjθi +   j>i piθj¢= piθi + 1 2 ¡Li + Ri¢. 
Another way to write the Shapley value formula is the following [10], SVi =   S⊆N:i∈S ∆(S) |S| , where ∆(S) = C(S) if |S| = 1 and ∆(S) = C(S)−£T S ∆(T).
(1) The Shapley value allocation rule says that jobs are ordered using an efficient ordering and transfers are assigned to jobs such that the cost share of job i is given by Equation 1.
The worth of a coalition of S jobs is just −C(S).
This proves that ∆(S) = 0 if |S| > 2.
This gives ∆({i}) = C({i}) = piθi ∀i ∈ N. For any i, j ∈ N with i = j, we have ∆({i, j}) = C({i, j}) − C({i}) − C({j}) = min(piθi + pjθj + pjθi, piθi + pjθj + piθj) − piθi − pjθj = min(pjθi, piθj).
So, ∆(S) = C(S) − ∆({i, j}) − ∆({j, k}) − ∆({i, k})−∆({i})−∆({j})−∆({k}) = C(S)−piθj −pjθk − piθk − piθi − pjθj − pkθk = C(S) − C(S) = 0.
Other interesting ways to define the worth of a coalition in such games is discussed by Chun [1], who assume that a coalition of jobs are served after the jobs not in the coalition are served.
Now, assume for T S, ∆(T) = 0 if |T| > 2.
The Shapley value (or cost share) of a job i is defined as, SVi =   S⊆N\{i} |S|!
We will show by induction that ∆(S) = 0 if |S| > 2.
Maniquet [15] observes another equivalent way to define the worth of a coalition is using the dual function of the cost function C(·).
Without loss of generality, assume θi pi ≥ θj pj ≥ θk pk .
(|N| − |S| − 1)!
¡C(S∪{i})−C(S)¢.
Without loss of generality assume that σ to be the identity mapping.
VALUE In this section, we define the coalitional cost of this game and analyze the solution proposed by the Shapley value.
