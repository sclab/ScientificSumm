For adjusted  noenvy, if (σ, t) is an allocation for some q ∈ Q, let tij be the 237 transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with respect to ordering σij .
To overcome this, Chun [2] introduces the notion of adjusted no-envy, which he shows is satisfied in the Shapley value rule when processing times of all jobs are unity.
An allocation rule satisfies no-envy if for all q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), and i, j ∈ N, we have πi ≤ ci(σij ) − tj, where π is the cost share from allocation rule (σ, t) and σij is the ordering obtaining by swapping i and j.
The reasonable cost sharing mechanism says that every job should be paid a constant fraction of the difference  between the waiting cost he incurs and the waiting cost he inflicts on other jobs.
From ETE, we get, πi = πj ⇒ ci(σ) − ti = cj(σ) − tj ⇒ piθi + (1 − α)Li + αRi = pjθj + (1 − α)Lj + αRj (Since ψ is efficient and reasonable) ⇒ (1 − α)(Li − Lj) = α(Rj − Ri) (Using pi = pj, θi = θj) ⇒ 1 − α = α (Using Li − Lj = Rj − Ri = 0) ⇒ α = 1 2 .
ˆπi = ci(σii+k ) − tii+k i = piθi + 1 2 ¡  j<i θipj + θipi+k +   i<j<i+k θipj +   j>i θjpi − θi+kpi −   i<j<i+k θjpi¢ = SVi + 1 2   i<j≤i+k ¡θipj − θjpi¢ ≥ SVi (Using the fact that θi pi ≥ θj pj for i < j). 
Any efficient and reasonable allocation rule ψ that satisfies ETE is a rule implied by the Shapley value rule.
From the result in [2], the Shapley value rule does not  satisfy no-envy in our model also.
For simplicity, we state the definition of adjusted no-envy to apply to all such rules.
As before denote σij be an ordering where the position of i and j is swapped from an ordering σ.
An allocation rule satisfies adjusted  noenvy if for all q ∈ Q, (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q), and i, j ∈ N, we have πi ≤ ci(σij ) − tij i .
If α = 1, then every job gets compensated for its waiting cost but compensates others for the cost he inflicts on others.
This gives us the Shapley value rule by Lemma 3.
An allocation rule ψ is reasonable if for all q ∈ Q and (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q) we have for all i ∈ N, ti = α ¡θi   j∈Pi(σ) pj − pi   j∈Fi(σ) θj¢∀ i ∈ N, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
Let (σ, t) ∈ ψ(q) and π be the resulting cost shares.
5.2 Results on Envy Chun [2] discusses a fariness condition called no-envy for the case when processing times of all jobs are unity.
, n. Consider two jobs i and i + k. From Lemma 3, SVi = piθi + 1 2 ¡  j<i θipj +   j>i θjpi¢.
The Shapley value rule comes as a result of ETE as shown in the following proposition.
The Shapley value rule satisfies adjusted no-envy.
Here, we show that adjusted envy  continues to hold in the Shapley value rule in our model (when processing times need not be unity).
Consider a q ∈ Q in which pi = pj and θi = θj.
Proposition 6.
For example, if ψ is efficient, then tij cannot be calculated if σij is also not efficient.
Without loss of generality, assume efficient  ordering of jobs is: 1, .
5.1 A Reasonable Class of Cost Sharing  Mechanisms In this section, we will define a reasonable class of cost sharing mechanisms.
Observe that an allocation may not allow for calculation of tij .
We will show how these reasonable mechanisms lead to the Shapley value mechanism.
Let ˆπi be the cost share of i due to adjusted transfer tii+k i in the ordering σii+k .
Proposition 5.
If α = 0, then every job bears its own cost.
