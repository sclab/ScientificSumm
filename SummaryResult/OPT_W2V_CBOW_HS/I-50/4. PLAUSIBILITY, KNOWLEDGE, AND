The following formulae are strongly valid in the class of plausibly serial CTLKP models: (i) Baϕ ↔ KaPl aϕ, (ii) Kaϕ ↔ BaPh ϕ. Theorem 15.
Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all CTLKP models.
4.3 Properties of the Update The first notable property of plausibility update is that it influences only formulae in which plausibility plays a role, i.e.
The reason lies rather in the fact that we investigate knowledge, beliefs and plausibility in a temporal framework, as Proposition 12 shows.
It is easy to see that the axiom is not valid in general: as we have no restrictions on plausibility sets Υa, it may be as well that Υa = ∅.
Note that this characterization has a strong commonsense reading: believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all plausibly imaginable situations.
The following two theorems characterize the relationship between knowledge and beliefs: first for the class of p-serial models, and then, finally, for all models.
We have the following strong validities: (i) |≡ Pl aKaϕ ↔ Kaϕ (ii) |≡ Ph Kaϕ ↔ KaPh ϕ and |≡ KaPh ϕ ↔ Kaϕ We now want to examine the relationship between  knowledge and belief.
Proposition 4.
M is plausibly serial for agent a iff  formula Pl aE f is valid in M. M is weakly p-serial for agent a iff ¬KaPl aA f⊥ is valid in M. 4.1 Axiomatic Properties Theorem 5.
Note that its specific is not due to the plausibility-based  definition of beliefs.
For example, we may know that an  invasion from another galaxy is in principle possible (KaE♦ invasion), but if we do not take this possibility as plausible (¬Pl aE♦ invasion), then we reject the corresponding belief in consequence (¬BaE♦ invasion).
We define the universal sublanguage of CTLK in a way similar to [21]: ϕu ::= p | ¬p | ϕu ∧ ϕu | ϕu ∨ ϕu | Aγu | Kaϕu, γu ::= fϕu | 2 ϕu | ϕuU ϕu.
(ii) If ϕ, ϕ1, ϕ2 are arbitrary CTLK formulae, then: |≡ (set-pla fϕ)Pl aA f(Ph ϕ), |≡ (set-pla 2 ϕ)Pl aA2 (Ph ϕ), and |≡ (set-pla ϕ1U ϕ2)Pl aA(Ph ϕ1)U (Ph ϕ2). 
for each q ∈ Q there is a q ∈ Q such that q ∼a q and q ∈ on(Υa).
Then Kaϕ → Baϕ is strongly valid, and in the class of p-serial models we have even that |≡ Kaϕ ↔ Baϕ.
The axiom is not even valid in the class of p-serial models.
A CTLKP model is plausibly serial (or p-serial) for agent a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path  according to a, i.e.
However, it is strongly valid in the class of weak p-serial models (and therefore also in the class of p-serial models).
BELIEFS IN CTLKP In this section we study some relevant properties of  plausibility, knowledge, and beliefs; in particular, axioms KDT45 are examined.
That is, modalities Ka form system S5 in the sense of normal validity, and KD45 in the sense of strong validity.
The following formulae are not valid: (iv) Baϕ → BaKaϕ, (v) Kaϕ → Baϕ The last invalidity is especially important: it is not the case that knowing something implies believing in it.
Proposition 11.
Axiom T is not even valid for p-serial  models.
Note that this property reflects the strong connection between belief and plausibility in our framework.
Belief modalities Ba form system K45 in the class of all models, and KD45 in the class of weakly plausibly serial models (in the sense of both normal and strong validity).
Axiom T for beliefs is not valid; i.e., |= (Baϕ → ϕ).
This emphasizes that we study a specific concept of beliefs here.
We call a model weakly p-serial if every state has at least one  indistinguishable counterpart which lies on a plausible path, i.e.
Proposition 13.
Axioms K, D, 4, and 5 for knowledge are strongly valid, and axiom T is valid.
But first, we identify two important  subclasses of models with plausibility.
Moreover, as one may expect, beliefs do not have to be always true.
However, we have the following validities: (i) |≡ (set-pla γu)Pl aAγu, where γu is a universal CTLK path formula from Definition 1.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 587 Moreover, it is important that we use branching time with explicit quantification over paths; this observation is  formalized in Proposition 13.
Proposition 6.
In that case we have Baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ, because the set of states to be considered becomes empty.
Formula Baϕ ↔ KaPl a(E f → ϕ) is strongly valid.
However, it turns out that D is valid for a very natural class of models.
Axioms K, 4, and 5 for beliefs are strongly valid.
4.2 Plausibility, Knowledge, and Beliefs First, we investigate the relationship between knowledge and plausibility/physicality operators.
Proposition 7.
We propose two alternative ways out: the first one restricts the language of the update similarly to [21]; the other refers to physical possibilities, in a way analogous to [13].
On the other hand, for instance, an agent does not necessarily believe in all the things he knows.
At first sight, formula (set-pla γ)Pl aAγ seems a natural  characterization; however, it is not valid.
Proposition 8.
As we will see further, a weaker requirement is sometimes sufficient.
Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula that does not include any temporal operators.
Then, we have |≡ ϕ ↔ (set-pla γ)ϕ.
Let ϕu be a universal CTLK formula.
For instance, if agent a believes in  something, he knows that he believes it.
ones in which belief or plausibility modalities occur.
That is, we have: |≡ (Baϕ ∧ Ba(ϕ → ψ)) → Baψ, |≡ (Baϕ → BaBaϕ), and |≡ (¬Baϕ → Ba¬Baϕ).
We get the following characterization of both model classes.
Proposition 17.
Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula that does not include operators Pl a and Ba, and γ be a CTLKP path formula.
This is because, by leaving the other (implausible) paths out of scope, we may leave out of |γ| some paths that were needed to satisfy γ (see the  example in Section 4.2).
The next proposition concerns the consistency axiom D: Baϕ → ¬Ba¬ϕ.
Proposition 16.
What can be said about the result of an update?
Proposition 12.
The following formulae are strongly valid: (i) Baϕ → KaBaϕ, (ii) KaBaϕ → Baϕ, (iii) Kaϕ → BaKaϕ.
Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula, and M be a CTLKP model.
Then, we look at the interaction between knowledge and beliefs.
Or, if he knows a fact, he also believes that he knows it.
Then |≡ Kaϕu → Baϕu.
Obviously, p-seriality implies weak p-seriality.
We do not include proofs here due to lack of space.
The CTLKP formula (set-pla γ)Pl aAγ is not valid.
We call such ϕu universal formulae, and γu universal path formulae.
