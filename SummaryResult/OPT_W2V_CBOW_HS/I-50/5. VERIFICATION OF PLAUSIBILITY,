First, subformulae are evaluated recursively: for every subformula ψ of ϕ, the set of states in M that satisfy ψ is computed and labeled with a new proposition pψ.
We follow this idea here, studying the complexity of model checking CTLKP formulae against CTLK models (which can be seen as a compact representation of CTLKP  models in which all the paths are assumed plausible), with the underlying idea that plausibility sets, when needed, must be defined explicitly in the object language.
Now, it is enough to define checking M, q |= ϕ for ϕ in which all (state) subformulae are propositions, with the following cases: Case M, q |= E(2 p ∧ γ): If M, q |= p, then return no.
In general, model checking CTL+ (and also CTLK+) is ΔP 2 -complete.
Note that the resulting sentences belong to the logic of CTLK+, that is CTL+ (where each path quantifier can be followed by a Boolean combination of vanilla path  formulae)9 with epistemic modalities.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Case M, q |= E(p1U p2 ∧ p3U p4): Note that this is  equivalent to checking E(p1 ∧ p3)U (p2 ∧ Ep3U p4) ∨ E(p1 ∧ p3)U (p4 ∧ Ep1U p2), which is a CTL formula.
We translate the resulting CTLKP formulae to ones without plausibility via function tr(ϕ) = tr−→γ0,0(ϕ), defined as  follows: tr−→γ ,i(p) = p, tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) = tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1) ∧ tr−→γ ,i(ϕ2), tr−→γ ,i(¬ϕ) = ¬tr−→γ ,i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(Kaϕ) = Ka tr−→γ ,0(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(Pla ϕ) = tr−→γ ,a(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i((set-pla γ )ϕ) = tr−→γ [γ /a],i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(Ph ϕ) = tr−→γ ,0(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i( fϕ) = ftr−→γ ,i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(2 ϕ) = 2 tr−→γ ,i(ϕ), tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1U ϕ2) = tr−→γ ,i(ϕ1)U tr−→γ ,i(ϕ2), tr−→γ ,i(Eγ ) = E(−→γ [i] ∧ tr−→γ ,i(γ )).
Otherwise, remove from M all the states that do not satisfy p (yielding a sparser model M ), and check the CTL formula Eγ in M , q with any CTL model-checker.
Other cases: The above cases cover all possible formulas that begin with a path quantifier.
Clearly, verifying CTLKP properties directly against models with plausibility does not make much sense, since these models are inherently infinite; what we need is a finite representation of plausibility sets.
TIME AND BELIEFS In this section we report preliminary results on model checking CTLKP formulae.
Case M, q |= E( fp ∧ γ): Create M by adding a copy q of state q, in which only the transitions to states  satisfying p are kept (i.e., M, q |= r iff M, q |= r; and q Rq iff qRq and M, q |= p).
Model checking CTLKP against CTLK models is PTIME-complete, and can be done in time O(ml), where m is the number of transitions in the model, and l is the length of the formula to be checked.
9 For the semantics of CTL+, and discussion of model checking complexity, cf.
One such representation has been discussed in Section 3.3: plausibility sets can be defined by path formulae and the update operator (set-pla γ).
For other cases, standard CTLK model checking can be used.
First of all, we get rid of the belief operators (due to  Theorem 15), replacing every occurrence of Baϕ with KaPl a(E f → ϕ).
Below we sketch an algorithm that model-checks CTLKP formulae in time linear wrt the size of the model and the length of the  formula.
This means that we have extended CTLK to a more expressive language with no computational price to pay.
However, in our case, the Boolean  combinations of path subformulae are always conjunctions of at most two non-negated elements, which allows us to propose the following model checking algorithm.
The following proposition justifies the translation.
Additionally, we define −→γ [0] = .
For any CTLKP formula ϕ without Ba, we have that M, q |=CTLKP ϕ iff M, q |=CTLK+ tr(ϕ).
Then, check Eγ in M , q .
Now, let −→γ = γ1, ..., γk be a vector of vanilla path formulae (one per agent), with the initial vector −→γ0 = , ..., , and −→γ [γ /a] denoting vector −→γ , in which −→γ [a] is replaced with γ .

That is, the  complexity is no worse than for CTLK itself.
