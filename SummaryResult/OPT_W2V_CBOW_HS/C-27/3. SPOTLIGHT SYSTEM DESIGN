It is important to remark that the localization error is independent of the number of sensor nodes in the network.
At t = 4 the section where each node resides can be determined A more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the plane, hence the number of bits in the code will increase.
Point, Line and Area Cover events) every second and that the maximum tolerable localization error is r. Table 1 presents the execution cost comparison of the three different Spotlight techniques.
- Uncertainty in Detection: the sampling rate of the sensor nodes is finite, consequently, there will be an unpredictable delay between the time when an event is truly present and when the sensor node detects it.
Returning to the example shown in Figure 5, if a sensor node is located in the section with code 0000, and due to the noise, at time t = 3, it thinks it detected an event, it will incorrectly conclude that its code is 1000, and it positions itself two squares below its correct position.
We assume that the 15 sensor nodes are placed in a two dimensional plane (A=[l x l] ⊂R2 ) and that the scanning speed is s. The set of timestamps of events detected by a node i is Ti={ti1, ti2}.
Localization error with code placement and Hamming ECC 3.5 Event Distribution Function Analysis Although all three aforementioned techniques are able to localize the sensor nodes, they differ in the localization time, communication overhead and energy consumed by the Event Distribution Function (let"s call it Event Overhead).
Spotlight system architecture As shown in Figure 2, the Event Detection Function D(e) is supported by the sensor nodes.
For evaluation, we compared the average localization error in the presence of K-bit error for two strategies: the proposed Greedy Placement and the Row-Major Placement (it places the codes consecutively in the array, in row-first order).
With the support of these three functions, the localization process goes as follows: 1) A Spotlight device distributes events in the space A over a period of time.
The localization accuracy can deteriorate even further, if multiple errors are present in the transmission of the code.
4) The Spotlight device estimates the location of a sensor node i, using the time sequence Ti and the known E(t) function.
Each section Sk has a unique code k. The Spotlight device distributes the events according to these codes: at time j a section Sk is covered by an event (lit by light), if jth bit of k is 1.

3) After the event distribution, each sensor node sends the detection time sequence back to the Spotlight device.
The Localization function is an aggregation algorithm which calculates the intersection of multiple sets of points.
Localization of a sensor network using the Spotlight system We envision, and depict in Figure 1, a sensor network deployment and localization scenario as follows: wireless sensor nodes are randomly deployed from an unmanned aerial vehicle.
The Line Scan method trades the Event Overhead well with the localization time.
dddd, where d is a data bit) is transmitted as a 7-bit word by adding 3 error control bits (e.g.
Different code placement strategies Formally, a placement is represented by a function P: [0, l]d → C, which assigns a code to every coordinate in the d-dimensional cube of size l (e.g., in the planar case, we place codes in a  2dimensional grid).
However the Point Scan takes a much longer time than the Area Cover technique, which finishes in logrD seconds.
The Event Distribution Function E(t) is the core technique used in the Spotlight system and we propose three designs for it.
This allows the implementation of the Area Cover EDF.
As shown in Figure 3(a), when a light source emits a beam of light with the angular speed given by d s dt d S )(cos 2 αα α == , a light spot event with constant speed s is generated along the line situated at distance d. Figure 3.
For a given event e: ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = detectednotisEventfalse, detectedisEventtrue, )( e e eD (1) Definition 3: The Event Distribution Function (EDF) E(t) defines the point distribution of events within A at time t: }{ truepteDApptE =∧∈= )),((|)( (2) Definition 4: The Localization Function L(Ti) defines a localization algorithm with input Ti, a sequence of timestamps of events detected by the node i: I iTt i tETL ∈ = )()( (3) Figure 2.
Each section Sk within A has a unique code k. The Area Cover EDF is then defined as follows: ⊂ ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = 0iskofbitjthiffalse, 1iskofbitjthiftrue, ),( jkBIT (8) }{ truetkBITSpptE k =∧∈= ),()( and the corresponding localization algorithm is: { ∧∈=∧== )),(()(|)( iki TtiftruetkBITSCOGppTL (9)})`),(( iTTtiffalsetkBIT −∈= where COG(Sk) denotes the center of gravity of Sk.
The resulting localization function is: }{ sttETL iii ∗== 11 )()( (5) where D(e(ti1, pi)) = true for node i positioned at pi.
The implementation of the Line Scan EDF The Line Scan EDF is defined as follows: ( ){ ks,*tpl][0,kp(t)E kkx =∧∈= } for t ∈[0, l/s] and: ({ ls*tk,pl][0,kp(t)E kky −=∧∈= )} (6) for t ∈[ l/s, 2l/s].
The main idea of the Spotlight localization system is to generate controlled events in the field where the sensor nodes were deployed.

U )()()( tEtEtE yx= We can localize a node by calculating the intersection of the two event lines, as shown in Figure 4.
- Size of the Event: the events distributed by the Spotlight device can not be infinitely small.
Let"s assume that all sensor nodes are located in a square with edge size D, and that the Spotlight device can generate N events (e.g.
Considering the noise that is present in a real, outdoor environment, it is easy to observe that a relatively small error in detecting the correct bit pattern could result in a large localization error.
As shown in Figure 7, the placement A, in the presence of a 1-bit error has a smaller average localization error when compared to the placement B.
For each swap, we greedily chose a pair of codes, which can reduce the objective function (Equation 10) the most.
light spots) along this line with constant speed s. The set of timestamps of events detected by a node i is Ti={ti1}.
16 Considering that a limited number of corrections is possible by any coding scheme, a natural question arises: can we minimize the localization error when there are errors that can not be corrected?
The sensor nodes detect the events and report back to the Spotlight device, through a base station, the timestamps when the events were detected.
This ratio is constant for the Point Scan (r2 *N) while it grows linearly with area, for the Area Cover (D2 *N/2).
The Event Distribution E(t) and Localization Functions L(Ti) are implemented by a Spotlight device.
If error detection and correction schemes are used (e.g.
We illustrate the Area Cover EDF with a simple example.
Golay codes have been used in satellite and spacecraft data transmission and are most suitable in cases where short codeword lengths are desirable.
We discuss the implications of the power requirement for the Spotlight device, and offer a hybrid solution in Section 6.
3.2 Point Scan Event Distribution Function To illustrate the basic functionality of a Spotlight system, we start with a simple sensor system where a set of nodes are placed along a straight line (A = [0, l] R).
From Table 1, it can be observed that the execution costs do not depend on the number of sensor nodes to be localized.
Using the time when an event is perceived by a sensor node and the spatio-temporal properties of the generated events, spatial information (i.e.
With these devices, we can support the Line Scan Event Distributed Function easily.
This independence, as well as the aforementioned independence of the execution cost, indicate the very good scalability properties (with the number of sensor nodes, but not with the area of deployment) that the Spotlight system possesses. 
The probability of a failed transmission is thus: 0.11, if no error detection and correction is used; 0.0061 for the Hamming scheme (i.e.
Localization error with code placement and no ECC As Figure 8 shows, if no error detection/correction capability is present and 1-bit errors occur, then our Greedy Placement method can reduce the localization error by an average 23%, when compared to the Row-Major Placement.
This can be achieved by a clever placement of codes in the grid.
For practical purposes, the Area Cover is a viable solution for small to medium size networks, while the Line Scan works well for large networks.
The implementation of the Event Distribution Function E(t) is straightforward.
Golay codes can detect up to 6-bit errors and correct up to 3-bit errors.
Two of the most notable ones are the Hamming (7, 4) code and the Golay (23, 12) code.
The events cover the shaded areas.
The implementation of the Point Scan EDF The Point Scan EDF can be generalized to the case where nodes are placed in a two dimensional plane R2 .
In this case, the Spotlight system progressively scans the plane to activate the sensor nodes.
2) During the event distribution, sensor nodes record the time sequence Ti = {ti1, ti2, …, tin} at which they detect the events.
An imprecise input to the Localization Function L(T) leads to an error in node localization.
During the design of our Spotlight system, we made the following assumptions: - the sensor network to be localized is connected and a middleware, able to forward data from the sensor nodes to the Spotlight device, is present.
- a powerful Spotlight device is available and it is able to generate 14 spatially large events that can be detected by the sensor nodes, even in the presence of background noise (daylight).
The objective of our code placement strategy is to reduce the total Euclidean distance between all pairs of codes with Hamming distances smaller than K, the largest number of expected 1-bit errors.
A natural solution to this problem is to use error-correcting codes, which greatly reduce the probability of an error, without paying the price of a re-transmission, or lengthening the transmission time too much.
3.6 Localization Error Analysis The accuracy of localization with the Spotlight technique depends on many aspects.
The Event Distribution Function E(t) describes the distribution of events over time.
In this method we initialize the 2-dimensional grid with codes.
In the Hamming (7, 4) scheme, a message having 4 bits of data (e.g.
The events cover the shaded areas.
These designs have different tradeoffs and the cost comparison is presented in Section 3.5.
- Realization of Event Distribution Function: EDF defines locations of events at time t. Due to the limited accuracy (e.g.
A node residing anywhere in the section Sk is localized at the center of gravity of that section.
The major factors that were considered during the implementation of the system are discussed below: 17 - Time Synchronization: the Spotlight system exchanges time stamps between sensor nodes and the Spotlight device.
Due to the fact that E(t) is realized by the Spotlight device, the hardware requirements for the sensor nodes remain minimal.
If K=1, then there is no benefit in using the Greedy Placement method, since the 1-bit error can be corrected by the Hamming scheme.
If the deployment area is very large, the use of the Area Cover EDF is prohibitively expensive, if not impossible.
Then we swap the codes within the grid repeatedly, to minimize the objective function.
The Hamming coding scheme can detect up to 2-bit errors and correct 1-bit errors.
The idea of Area Cover EDF is to partition the space A into multiple sections and assign a unique binary identifier, called code, to each section.
Hamming (12, 8) and if 3-bit errors occur (K=3) then the Greedy Placement method reduces localization error by 12%, when compared to the Row-Major Placement, as shown in Figure 9.
More formally: I )()()( 21 iii tEtETL = (7) where D(e(ti1, pi)) = true, D(e(ti2, pi)) = true for node i positioned at pi.
To obtain pi(x, y, z), a Spotlight localization system needs to support three main functions, namely an Event Distribution Function (EDF) E(t), an Event Detection Function D(e), and a Localization Function L(Ti).
If a node detects one event, it is hard for it to estimate the exact location of itself within the event.
The steps of Area Cover EDF.
The Spotlight device computes the location of the sensor nodes.
The steps of the Area Cover technique, when using Hamming (7, 4) scheme are shown in Figure 6.
By doubling the Event Overhead, the Line Scan method takes only r/2D percentage of time to complete, when compared with the Point Scan method.
- the aerial vehicle has a very good knowledge about its position and orientation (6 parameters: 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation) and it possesses the map of the field where the network was deployed.
Let Ti={ti1, ti2, …, tin} be a set of n timestamps of events detected by a node i.
For example, nodes within section 1010 detect the events at time T = {1, 3}.
In order to formally describe and generalize the Spotlight localization system, we introduce the following definitions.
3.1 Definitions and Problem Formulation Let"s assume that the space A ⊂R3 contains all sensor nodes N, and that each node Ni is positioned at pi(x, y, z).
The steps of Area Cover EDF with Hamming (7, 4) ECC.
As shown in Figure 5, the plane A is divided in 16 sections.
The proposed Greedy Placement method ends when no swap of codes can further minimize the objective function.
In general, it is analytically hard to obtain the global minimum.
It is important to remark the ratio Event Overhead per unit time, which is indicative of the power requirement for the Spotlight device.
For the case of independent detections, the higher dH(i, j) is, the lower the crossover probability will be.

Let T"={t1", t2", …, tm"} be the set of m timestamps of events generated in the sensor field.
Golay is thus 80 times more robust that the Hamming scheme, which is 20 times more robust than the no error correction scheme.
more than 1-bit error); and 0.000076 for the Golay scheme (i.e.
After deployment, the sensor nodes self-organize into a network and execute a time-synchronization protocol.
Similar to Hamming (7, 4), Golay constructs a 23-bit codeword from 12-bit data.
Definition 2: The Event Detection Function D(e) defines a binary detection algorithm.
Let"s assume a 1-bit error probability of 0.01, and a 12-bit message that needs to be transmitted.
Due to the uncertainty in hardware processing and wireless communication, we can only confine such errors within certain bounds (e.g.
Lower sampling rates will generate larger localizations errors.
- a line of sight between the Spotlight device and sensor nodes exists.
An event could be, for example, the presence of light in an area.
Let"s suppose that the localization is done within a plane (A R2 ).
We propose solutions that do not rely on these simplifying assumptions, in Section 6.
Both are perfect linear error correcting codes.
The Spotlight device generates point events (e.g.
It is the core of the Spotlight system and it is much more sophisticated than the other two functions.
Several error correction schemes have been proposed in the past.
They are formally defined as follows: Definition 1: An event e(t, p) is a detectable phenomenon that occurs at time t and at point p є A.
3.3 Line Scan Event Distribution Function Some devices, e.g.
In a noisy environment, dH(i,j) determines the crossover probability between the two codes.
Our assumptions are simplifying assumptions, meant to reduce the complexity of the presentation, for clarity.
This scenario is depicted in Figure 3(b).

We denote by dE(i, j) the Euclidean distance and by dH(i, j) the Hamming distance between two codes i and j.
It is necessary for the system to reach consensus on global time through synchronization.
