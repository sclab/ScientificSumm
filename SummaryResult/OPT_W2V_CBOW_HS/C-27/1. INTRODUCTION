These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.
While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.
We demonstrate that this localization is much more accurate (i.e., tens of centimeters) than the range-based localization schemes and that it has a much longer effective range (i.e., thousands of meters) than the solutions based on ultra-sound/acoustic ranging.
Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.
Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.
This system employs an asymmetric architecture, in which sensor nodes do not need any additional hardware, other than what they currently have.
the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.
At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 
In addition, the radio propagation characteristics vary over time and are environment dependent, thus imposing high calibration costs for the range-free localizations schemes.
Recently, wireless sensor network systems have been used in many promising applications including military surveillance, habitat monitoring, wildlife tracking etc.
An on-board GPS [23] is a typical high-end solution, which requires sophisticated hardware to achieve high resolution time synchronization with satellites.
To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.
The constraints on power and cost for tiny sensor nodes preclude this as a viable solution.
With such limitations in mind, this paper addresses the following research challenge: How to reconcile the need for high accuracy in location estimation with the cost to achieve it.
First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.
Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.
Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e.
For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].
Other solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among neighboring nodes.
All the sophisticated hardware and computation reside on a single Spotlight device.
The Spotlight device uses a steerable laser light source, illuminating the sensor nodes placed within a known terrain.
Our answer to this challenge is a localization system called Spotlight.
The difficulties of these approaches are  twofold.
