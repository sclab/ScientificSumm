Definition 2 (Pairwise Key): For any two nodes A and B, if they have a common key E, then the key E is called a pairwise key between them.
Definition 4 (n-dimensional Hypercube): An n-dimensional Hypercube (or n−cube) H(v,n) is a topology with the following properties: (1) It is consisted of n·vn-1 edges, (2) Each node can be coded as a string with n positions such as b1b2…bn, where 0≤b1,b2,…,bn≤v-1, (3) Any two nodes are called neighbors, which means that there is an edge between them, iff there is just one position different between their node codes. 
Definition 1 (Key Predistribution): The procedure, which is used to encode the corresponding encryption and decryption algorithms in sensor nodes before distribution, is called Key Predistribution.
Definition 3 (Key Path): For any two nodes A0 and Ak, when there has not a pairwise key between them, if there exists a path A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak, and there exists at least one pairwise key between the nodes Ai and Aj for 0≤i≤k-1 and 1≤j≤k, then the path consisted of A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak is called a Key Path between A0 and Ak.
