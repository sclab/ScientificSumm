In this paper, we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution model of sensor networks, and for which, we propose a new pairwise key pre-distribution scheme.
Based on such a framework, they presented two pairwise key pre-distribution schemes: a random subset assignment scheme and a grid-based scheme.
Though hypercube-based scheme (we consider the grid-based scheme is a special case of hypercube-based scheme) has many attractive properties, it requires any two nodes in sensor networks can communication directly with each other.
All of those schemes above improve the security over the basic probabilistic key pre-distribution scheme.
Based on this grid, each sensor node can then identify whether it can directly establish a pairwise key with another node, and if not, what intermediate nodes it can contact to indirectly establish the pairwise key.
The key contribution is that our scheme dose not require the assumption of all nodes can directly communicate with each other as the previous schemes do, and it still maintains high probability of key establishment, low memory overhead and good security performance.
In the scheme, each sensor node randomly picks a set of keys from a key pool before the deployment so that any two of the sensor nodes have a certain probability to share at least one common key.
The  gridbased scheme associates polynomials with the rows and the columns of an artificial grid, assigns each sensor node to a unique coordinate in the grid, and gives the node the secrets generated from the corresponding row and column polynomials.
further extended this idea and presented two key  predistribution schemes: a q-composite key pre-distribution scheme and a random pairwise keys scheme.
Based on the topology, we propose a novel cluster distribution based hierarchical hypercube model to establish the pairwise key.
A polynomial pool is used in those schemes, instead of using a key pool in the previous techniques.
As one of the most fundamental security services, pairwise key establishment enables the sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques.
The random subset assignment scheme assigns each sensor node the secrets generated from a random subset of polynomials in the polynomial pool.
Though the random pairwise keys scheme doses not suffer from the above security problem, it incurs a high memory overhead, which increases linearly with the number of nodes in the network if the level of security is kept constant [2][4].
In 2004, Liu proposed a new hypercube-based pairwise key predistribution scheme [7], which extends the grid-based scheme from a two dimensional grid to a multi-dimensional hypercube.
The analysis shows that hypercube-based scheme keeps some attractive properties of the grid-based scheme, including the guarantee of establishing pairwise keys and the resilience to node compromises.
However, the pairwise key establishment problem in sensor networks is still not well solved.
However, due to the sensor nodes' limited computational capabilities, battery energy, and available memory, it is not feasible for them to use traditional pairwise key establishment techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC).
The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Combining the deployment knowledge of sensor networks and the polynomial pool-based key pre-distribution, we setup a  clusterbased topology that is practical with the real deployment of sensor networks.
For the basic probabilistic and the q-composite key  predistribution schemes, as the number of compromised nodes increases, the fraction of affected pairwise keys increases quickly.
The random scheme randomly picks pair of sensors and assigns each pair a unique random key [2].
Also, when perfect security against node compromise is required, the hypercube-based scheme can support a larger network by adding more dimensions instead of increasing the storage overhead on sensor nodes.
The q-composite scheme requires any two sensors share at least q pre-distributed keys.
The basic idea can be considered as the combination of the polynomial-based key pre-distribution and the key pool idea used in [1]] and [2].
Eschenauer and Gligor proposed a basic probabilistic key  predistribution scheme for pairwise key establishment [1].
We develop a kind of new pairwise key establishment algorithm with our hierarchical hypercube model.
Security communication is an important requirement in many sensor network applications, so shared secret keys are used between communicating nodes to encrypt data.
In section 4, a new Hierarchical Hypercube model is proposed.
As a result, a small number of compromised nodes may affect a large fraction of pairwise keys [3].
further developed the idea addressed in the previous works and proposed a general framework of polynomial pool-based key  predistribution [4].
Inspired by the studies above and the polynomial-based key pre-distribution protocol [3], Liu et al.
In section 6 and section 7, new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed based on the Hierarchical Hypercube model and detailed analyses are described.
This strong assumption is impractical in most of the actual applications of the sensor networks.
Several alternative approaches have been developed recently to perform pairwise key establishment on resource-constrained sensor networks without involving the use of traditional cryptography  [14].
For the random subset assignment scheme, it suffers higher communication and computation overheads.
The structure of this paper is arranged as follows: In section 3, a new distribution model of cluster deployed sensor networks is presented.
In section 5, the mapping relationship between the clusters deployed sensor network and Hierarchical Hypercube model is discussed.
A similar approach to those schemes described by Liu et al was independently developed by Du et a.
In some cases, it is essentially equivalent to the one in [4].
Rather than on Blundo's scheme their approach is based on Blom's scheme [6].
Finally, section 8 presents a conclusion.
