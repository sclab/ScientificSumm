The algorithm also solves instances with traditional pseudotree arrangements  using the same procedure as DPOP.
For some problem instances we observe significant improvements in message and computation sizes compared to DPOP.
Several current algorithms that solve general DCOP instances,  including ADOPT and DPOP, arrange agents into a traditional  pseudotree structure.
We introduce an extension to the DPOP algorithm that handles an extended set of pseudotree arrangements.
Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) is a general  framework that can model complex problems in multi-agent systems.
We use multiple heuristics to generate pseudotrees and choose the best pseudotree in linear space-time complexity.
We prove that for some  problem instances it is not possible to generate a traditional pseudotree using edge-traversal heuristics that will outperform a cross-edged pseudotree.
Our  algorithm correctly solves DCOP instances for pseudotrees that  include edges between nodes in separate branches.
We compare our algorithm with DPOP using several metrics  including the induced width of the pseudotrees, the maximum  dimensionality of messages and computation, and the maximum  sequential path cost through the algorithm.
