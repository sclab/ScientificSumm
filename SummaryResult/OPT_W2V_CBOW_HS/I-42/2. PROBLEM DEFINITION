We define an edge-traversal based method as any method that produces a pseudotree in which all parent/child pairs share an edge in the original graph.
Also defined in [6] are four types of relationships between nodes exist in a pseudotree: • P(X) - the parent of a node X: the single node higher in the pseudotree that is connected to X directly through a tree edge • C(X) - the children of a node X: the set of nodes lower in the pseudotree that are connected to X directly through tree edges • PP(X) - the pseudo-parents of a node X: the set of nodes higher in the pseudotree that are connected to X directly through back-edges (In Figure 1, A = PP(C)) • PC(X) - the pseudo-children of a node X: the set of nodes lower in the pseudotree that are connected to X directly through back-edges (In Figure 1, C = PC(A)) Figure 1: A traditional pseudotree.
The bolded node, B, is the merge point for node E. 2.2 Cross-edged Pseudotrees We define a cross-edge as an edge from node X to a node Y that is above X but not in the path from X to the root.
The set of primary edges defines a spanning tree of the nodes.
A Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem with n nodes and m constraints consists of the tuple < X, D, U > where: • X = {x1,..,xn} is a set of variables, each one assigned to a unique agent • D = {d1,..,dn} is a set of finite domains for each variable • U = {u1,..,um} is a set of utility functions such that each function involves a subset of variables in X and defines a utility for each combination of values among these variables An optimal solution to a DCOP instance consists of an assignment of values in D to X such that the sum of utilities in U is maximal.
Next, various heuristics are used to arrange this graph into a pseudotree.
This definition also yields two additional types of relationships that may exist between nodes: • BP(X) - the branch-parents of a node X: the set of nodes higher in the pseudotree that are connected to X but are not in the primary path from X to the root (In Figure 2, D = BP(E)) • BC(X) - the branch-children of a node X: the set of nodes lower in the pseudotree that are connected to X but are not in any primary path from X to any leaf node (In Figure 2, E = BC(D)) 2.3 Pseudotree Generation 742 The Sixth Intl.
Our DCPOP algorithm generates a cross-edged pseudotree in the same fashion.
2.1 Traditional Pseudotrees Pseudotrees are a common structure used in search procedures to allow parallel processing of independent branches.
First, the DCOP instance < X, D, U > translates directly into a graph with X as the set of vertices and an edge for each pair of variables represented in U.
As defined in [6], a pseudotree is an arrangement of a graph G into a rooted tree T such that vertices in G that share an edge are in the same branch in T. A back-edge is an edge between a node X and any node which lies on the path from X to the root (excluding X"s parent).
For this paper we only consider binary utility functions involving two variables.
The parent, child, pseudo-parent, and pseudo-child relationships from the traditional pseudotree are now defined in the context of this  primary edge spanning tree.
Problem domains that require minimum cost instead of maximum utility can map costs into negative utilities.
In a cross-edged pseudotree we designate certain edges as primary.
A cross-edged  pseudotree is a traditional pseudotree with the addition of cross-edges.
Solid line edges  represent parent-child relationships and the dashed line represents a pseudo-parent-pseudo-child relationship.
Our heuristics that generate cross-edged pseudotrees use a distributed best-first search traversal. 
Solid line edges represent parent-child relationships, the dashed line represents a  pseudoparent-pseudo-child relationship, and the dotted line  represents a branch-parent-branch-child relationship.
One common heuristic is to perform a guided depth-first search (DFS) as the resulting traversal is a pseudotree, and a DFS can easily be performed in a distributed fashion.
Figure 2 shows a cross-edged pseudotree with a cross-edge (D-E).
Higher order utility functions can be modeled with minor changes to the algorithm, but they also substantially increase the complexity.
Figure 1 shows a pseudotree with four nodes, three edges (A-B, B-C,  BD), and one back-edge (A-C).

on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Current algorithms usually have a pre-execution phase to  generate a traditional pseudotree from a general DCOP instance.
The utility functions represent soft constraints but can also represent hard constraints by using arbitrarily large negative values.
This includes DFS, breadth-first search, and best-first search based traversals.
DCOP has been formalized in slightly different ways in recent literature, so we will adopt the definition as presented in [6].
