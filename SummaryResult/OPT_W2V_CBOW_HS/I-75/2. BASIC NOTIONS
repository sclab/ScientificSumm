(That is, the number of observations to be made by the agents in the system is not infinite.)
We refer to this as the autonomy of the agent: no other agent can directly impose a given  hypothesis to an agent.
Remember that in this paper, we only consider the case of bilateral exchanges (an agent can only speak to a single other agent), and that we also assume that any agent can only engage in a single  exchange in a given round. 
Its connexions with these others agents may The Sixth Intl.
We assume h = Eh(O) to be consistent with O by definition of Eh, so using this function on its  observation set to determine its favourite hypothesis is a sure way for the agent to achieve consistency.
We will abstractly denote by C(ai, aj, t) the communication property, in other words, the fact that agents ai and aj can communicate at time t (note that this relation is assumed to be symetric, but of course not transitive).
• An agent ai consistent with a partner agent aj iff Cons(ai) and Cons(hi, Oj) (that is, this agent is  consistent and its hypothesis can explain the observation set of the other agent).
Each agent is defined as a tuple F, Oi, hi , where: • F, the set of facts, common knowledge to all agents.
In our context, agents evolve in a  dynamic environment, and we classicaly assume the following system cycle: 1.
(i) C(aI , ak1 , t1), (ii) C(akn , aJ , tn+1), (iii) ∀i ∈ [1, n], C(aki , aki+1 , ti) Intuitively, what this property says is that it is possible to find a temporal path in the future that would allow to link agent ai and aj via a sequence of intermediary agents.
This (deterministic) function takes a set of observation and returns a single prefered hypothesis (2O → H).
There exists a  temporal communication path at horizon tf (noted Ltf (aI , aJ )) between ai and aj iff there exists a sequence of time points t1, t2, .
• Two agents ai and aj are mutually consistent (MCons(ai, aj)) iff Cons(ai, aj) and Cons(aj, ai).
As a consequence, only a new observation (being it a new perception, or an observation communicated by a fellow agent) can result in a modification of its prefered hypothesis hi (but not necessarily of course).
Note that the time points are not necessarily successive, and that the sequence of agents may involve the same agents several times.
Agent Cycle Now we need to see how these agents will evolve and interact in their environment.
A system is temporaly connex iff ∀t ∀(i, j)∈[1, n]2 Lt(ai, aj) In short, a temporaly connex system guarantees that any agent will be able to communicate with any other agents, no matter how long it might take to do so, at any time.
We are now in a position to define two essential properties of our system.
We say that: • An agent is consistent (Cons(ai)) iff Cons(hi, Oi) (that is, its hypothesis is consistent with its  observation set).
Environment Let O be the (potentially infinite) set of possible  observations.
We assume the sensors of our agents to be perfect, hence the observations to be certain.
Who an agent can communicate with will be defined dynamically (for instance, this can be a  consequence of the agents being close enough to get in touch).
Let Cons(h, O) be the consistency relation, a binary relation between a hypothesis h ∈ H and a set of observations O ⊆ O.
• Oi ∈ 2O , the set of observations made by the agent so far.
We finally define a property of the system that we shall use in the rest of the paper: Definition 3 (Bounded Perceptions).
Any agent can only be involved in one communication with another agent by step.
, tn from t is an ordered set of time points t1, t2, .
Environment dynamics: the environment evolves  according to the defined rules of the system dynamics.
Typically, an agent can only communicate with agents that it can sense, but one could imagine evolving topological constraints on communication based on a network of communications  between agents where the links are not always active.
the agent can only see a portion of a map).
At a given time, an agent will only be able to communicate with a number of neighbours.
We define below sequences of time points to deal with it: Definition 1 (Sequence of time points).
Let H be the set of hypotheses, uncertain and revisable.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 999 evolve with its situation in the environment.
To put it another way, it is never the case that an agent will be isolated for ever from another agent of the system.
• A system is consistent iff ∀(i, j)∈[1, n]2 it is the case that MCons(ai, aj).
To ensure its consistency, each agent is equipped with an abstract reasoning machinery that we shall call the  explanation function Eh.
A key notion governing the formation of hypotheses is that of consistency, defined below: Definition 2 (Consistency).
In most cases, Cons will refer to classical consistency relation, however, we may overload its meaning and add some additional properties to that relation (in which case we will mention it).
Note however that an hypothesis does not need to be generated by Eh to be  consistent with an observation set.
Reasoning step: agents compare perception with predictions, seek explanations for (potential)  difference(s), refine their hypothesis, draw new conclusions.
• hi ∈ H, the favourite hypothesis of the agent.
As a concrete example of such a function, and one of the main inspiration of this work, one can cite the Theorist reasoning system [6] -as long as it is coupled with a filter selecting a single prefered theory among the ones initially selected by Theorist.
A  sequence of time points t1, t2, .
We start by defining the basic elements of our system.
Action step: agents do some practical reasoning using the models obtained from the previous steps and select an action.
A system involves a bounded perception for agents iff ∃n0 s.t.
Communication In our system, agents will be able to communicate with each other.
Agent We take a system populated by n agents a1, .
Note also that hi may only be modified as a consequence of the application Eh.
We will next discuss the detail of how communication  concretely takes place in our system.
Communication step: agents can communicate  hypotheses and observations with other agents through a defined protocol.
Perception step : agents get perceptions from the  environment.
They can then modify the environment by executing it.
We assume a perfect memory, hence this set grows monotonically.
, tn from tf and a sequence of agents k1, k2, .
The communication of the agents will be further  constrained by topological consideration.
However, due to the aforementionned topological  constraints, they will not be able to communicate with any agents at anytime.
The environment may include some dynamics, and change over the course of time.
These perceptions are typically partial (e.g.
, tn such that t1 ≥ t and ∀i ∈ [1, n − 1], ti+1 ≥ ti.
