Many of these works however make the assumption that this approach is beneficial to start with, and study the technical facets of the problem (or instead emphasize other advantages of using argumentation).
In this paper we  exhibit some sufficient conditions on the system dynamics and on the protocol/strategy structures that allow to guarantee that property, and we experimentally study some contexts where (some of) these assumptions are relaxed.
Section 4 details one of 998 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the main results of the paper, namely the fact that under the aforementioned conditions, the constraints that we put on the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system towards global consistency, at the condition that no agent ever gets completely lost forever in the system, and that unlimited time is allowed for computation and argument  exchange.
If, in addition, the communication  opportunities are severely constrained (for instance, agents can only communicate when they are close enough to some other agent), and dynamically changing (for instance, agents may change their locations), it becomes crucial to carefully  design protocols that will allow agents to converge to some desired state of global consistency.
We put special attention at clearly emphasizing the conditions on the system dynamics and protocols/strategies that will be exploited in the rest of the paper.
The results reported here show that the effectiveness of argument exchange  crucially depends upon the nature of the building, and provide some insights regarding the design of optimal protocol for hypotheses refinement in this context. 
If each agent computes only locally its favoured hypothesis, it is only  natural to assume that agents will seek to coordinate and  refine their hypotheses by confronting their observations with other agents.
To get a clearer picture of the situation induced when time is a critical factor, we have set up an  experimental framework that we introduce and discuss in Section 5.
They show in particular that the number of messages required to establish this global  diagnosis is bound to be prohibitive, unless the communication is enhanced with some suitable protocol.
The benefits of enhancing communication with supporting information to make convergence to a desired global state of a system more efficient has often been put forward in the literature.
Roos and  colleagues [8, 9] in particular study a situation where a number of distributed entities try to come up with a satisfying global diagnosis of the whole system.
Section 2 specifies the basic elements of our model, and Section 3 goes on to presenting the different protocols and strategies used by the agents to exchange hypotheses and observations.
We consider a multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives its environment, and we assume that some unexpected event occurs in that system.
While the conditions on protocols and strategies are fairly mild, it is also clear that these system requirements look much more problematic, even frankly unrealistic in  critical situations where distributed approaches are precisely advocated.
This is for instance one of the main idea  underlying the argumentation-based negotiation approach [7], where the desired state is a compromise between agents with  conflicting preferences.
However, they do not put any restrictions on agents" communication options, and do not assume either that the system is dynamic.
While problems of diagnosis are among the venerable  classics in the AI tradition, their multiagent counterparts have much more recently attracted some attention.
Notable exceptions are the works of [3, 4, 2, 5], which studied in contexts different from ours the efficiency of argumentation.
The rest of the paper is as follows.
The critical situation involves a number of agents aiming at escaping from a burning building.
