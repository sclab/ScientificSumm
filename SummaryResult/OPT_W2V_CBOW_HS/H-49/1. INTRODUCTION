We would be more comfortable with a retrieval where scores are consistent between related documents.
That is, if a and b are both on the topic of the query, we would like them both to receive a high score; if a and b are not on the topic of the query, we would like them both to receive a low score.
In this paper, we demonstrate a strong correlation between IM and retrieval performance.
If we randomly select pairs of documents from this set, we expect some pairs to share the same topic and other pairs to not share the same topic.
If the scores of a and b are very different, we may be concerned about the  performance of our system.
Because of this, we interpret  autocorrelation as measuring the degree to which a retrieval function satisfies the clustering hypothesis.
Our paper studies the quantification of this inconsistency in a retrieval from a spatial perspective.
As we shall see, a retrieval function"s spatial autocorrelation  measures the degree to which closely-related documents receive similar scores.
We might become more worried as we find more differences between scores of related documents.
A theoretical treatment of the similarities and  motivations behind several state-of-the-art performance  prediction techniques (Section 4).
Spatial analysis is appropriate since many retrieval models embed documents in some vector space.
The first large-scale experiments of zero-judgment,  single run performance prediction (Sections 5 and 6). 
A general, robust method for predicting the  performance of retrievals with zero relevance judgments  (Section 3).
In this work, we provide the following contributions, 1.
The cluster hypothesis states: closely-related documents tend to be relevant to the same request [12].
The system retrieves n documents each receiving a  realvalued score indicating the predicted degree of relevance.
If this connection is  reasonable, in Section 6, we present evidence that failure to satisfy the cluster hypothesis correlates strongly with poor performance.
Score  consistency can be measured by the spatial version of  autocorrelation known as the Moran coefficient or IM [5, 10].
If documents are embedded in a space, proximity correlates with topical relationships.
The discussion up to this point is reminiscent of the  cluster hypothesis.
In information retrieval, a user poses a query to a system.
Take two topically-related  documents from the set and call them a and b.
