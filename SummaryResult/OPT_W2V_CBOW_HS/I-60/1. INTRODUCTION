We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular  networks.
We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.
In Section 2 we review related work in the field of self-interested agents and V2V communications.
This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.
We build on the notion of Gossip Networks, introduced by Shavitt and Shay [15], in which the agents can obtain road congestion information by gossiping with peer agents using ad-hoc communication.
The second type of behavior, described in Section 5, is modeled by the self-interested agents" objective to cause disorder in the network, more than they are interested in maximizing their own utility.
In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a  selfish agent in vehicular networks.
To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents, we have used a simulation environment, which  models the transportation network in a central part of a large real city.
Our findings can motivate future research in this field in order to minimize the effect of selfish-agents.
An important advancement in this  respect is the introduction of ad-hoc communication networks (such as Wi-Fi), which enable the exchange of information between cars, e.g., for locating road congestions [1] and  optimal routes [15] or improving traffic safety [2].
In this paper we focus mainly on the attractiveness of selfish behavior by these agents, while we also provide some insights 327 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS into the possibility of detecting self-interested agents and minimizing their effect.
This situation can be modeled in real life by car owners, whose aim is to reach their destination as fast as  possible, and would like to have their way free of other cars.
Sections 4 and 5 describe the different behaviors of the  selfinterested agents and our findings.
That is, we investigate the benefits achieved by car owners, who tamper with on-board devices and incorporate their own self-interested agents in them, which act for their benefit.
However, the introduction of mechanisms to deal with self-interested agents is costly and time consuming.
For example, GM"s proprietary algorithm [6], called the threat assessment  algorithm, constantly calculates, in real time, other vehicles" positions and speeds, and enables messaging other cars when a collision is imminent; Also, Honda has began testing its system in which vehicles talk with each other and with the highway system itself [7].
This kind of behavior could be generated, for example, by vandalism or terrorists, who aim to cause as much mayhem in the network as possible.
The simulation environment is further described in Section 3.
In the first behavior, described in Section 4, the objective of the self-interested agents is to maximize their own utility, expressed by their average journey duration on the road.
This is similar, though in a different context, to the problem introduced by Lamport et al.
Our simulations provide insights to the benefits of self-interested agents cheating.
We continue and formally  describe our environment and simulation settings in Section 3.
To this end they will let their agents cheat the other agents, by injecting false information into the network.
Finally, we conclude the paper with open questions and future research directions. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
As technology advances, more and more cars are being equipped with devices, which enable them to act as  autonomous agents.
Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) communication is already  onboard by some car manufactures, enabling the  collaboration between different cars on the road.
