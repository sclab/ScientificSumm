In the next section we describe another scenario for the self-interested agents, in which they are not concerned with their own utility, but rather interested in maximizing the average journey length of other gossip agents. 
That is, even with just one self-interested car, we can see that both the gossip agents that follow the same route as the lies spread by the self-interested agents, and other  regular agents, increase their journey length by more than 14%.
It is also interesting to note the large value attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration.
We will investigate the game, in which the self-interested and the regular gossip agents can choose the following actions.
Thus, spreading the lies in the first iteration does not help the self-interested agent to free the route he is about to travel, in the first iteration.
UTILITY In the first set of experiments we investigated the benefits achieved by the self-interested agents, whose aim was to  minimize their own journey length.
In the second set of experiments, the self-interested agents have the objective to help another agent, who is supposed to enter the network some time  after the self-interested agent entered.
In order to prevent the  gossip agents from detecting the lies and just discarding those values, the self-interested agents send lies in a given range, [Ts, Tmax], with an inverse geometric distribution, that is, the higher the T value, the higher its frequency.
By  contradiction, again assume that the self-interested agents choose another value Ts > Tavg.
In this case, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg + 1, since by doing so they increase their own utility: ug (Ts, Tg + 1) = Tg + 1 − Tavg.
In this scenario, just like the previous one, in the first iterations, not only does the beneficiary agent not avoid the jammed roads, since he ignores all heavy traffic, he also does not benefit from the lies spread by the self-interested agent.
This is mainly due to the fact that the lies do not bypass the self-interested agent and reach other cars that are ahead of the self-interested car on the same route.
We can see from the results that the first time the  selfinterested agents traveled the route while spreading the false data about the roads did not help them (using the paired t-test we show that those agents had significantly lower  journey lengths in the scenario in which they did not spread any lies, with p < 0.01).
In the case of one self-interested agent there is a significant difference  between the average journey length of when the agent spread lies and when no lies are spread (p < 0.001), while when The Sixth Intl.
Thus, the regular gossip cars, attempting to  mitigate the effect of the liars, can choose a strategy to ignore abnormal congestion values above a certain threshold, Tg.
In the next subsection we analyze the scenario as a game and show that when in equilibrium the exchange of gossiping between the agents becomes inefficient.
Communicate the following data to other agents: (a) If the road is not in the agent"s route - send the true data about it (e.g., data about roads it has received from other agents) (b) For all roads in the agent"s route, which the agent has not yet traversed, send a random high weight.
This is mainly due to the  complexity of incorporating and maintaining such mechanisms, as well as due to the dynamics of the network, in which  interactions between different agents are frequent, agents may leave the network, and data about the road might change as time progresses (e.g., a road might be reported by a regular gossip agent as free at a given time, yet it may currently be jammed due to heavy traffic on the road).
In each simulation in this experiment, 6 different agents were randomly chosen to be part of the group of self-interested agents, as described above.
1 In other simulations we have run, in which there had been several real congestions in the network, we indeed saw that even when the roads are jammed, the self-interested agents were less affected if they ignored all reported heavy traffic, since by such they also discarded all lies roaming the network Table 1: Normalized journey length values,  selfinterested agents with the same route Iteration Self-Interested Gossip - Gossip - Regular Number Agents SR Others Agents 1 1.38 1.27 1.06 1.06 2 0.95 1.56 1.18 1.14 3 1.00 1.86 1.28 1.17 4 1.06 2.93 1.35 1.16 5 1.13 2.00 1.40 1.17 6 1.08 2.02 1.43 1.18 Thus, several cars, which had the same origin and  destination points, were designated as self-interested agents.
That is, (Ts, Tg) is a Nash equilibrium if the self-interested agents have no other value Ts such that us (Ts, Tg) > us (Ts, Tg), and similarly for the gossip agents.
We denote the time the self-interested agents spread as Ts, such that Tavg ≤ Ts ≤ Tmax.
We recall from [12], that the Nash equilibrium is a strategy  profile, where no player has anything to gain by deviating from his strategy, given that the other agent follows his strategy profile.

The utility functions are defined as: us = 0 if Ts ≥ Tg Ts − Tavg + 1 if Ts < Tg (1) ug = Tg − Tavg if Ts ≥ Tg Ts − Tg if Ts < Tg (2) We are interested in finding the Nash equilibrium.
We also assume that the objective of the self-interested agents is to minimize their own journey length, thus they spread lies on their routes, as described in Section 4.1.
As opposed to the gossip agents, we can see how little effect the self-interested agents have on the regular agents.
Since we noticed that cheating by the self-interested agents does not benefit them in the first iteration, we devised  another set of experiments.
Thus, the utility value of the  selfinterested agents in this case is 0.
The reason for this is that other  gossip agents received this data and used it to recalculate their shortest path, thus avoiding entrance to the roads, for which the self-interested agents had spread false information about congestion.
From the regular gossip agents point-of-view, if they accept messages from the self-interested agents, then they  incorporate the lies in their calculation, thus they will lose utility points.
Yet, as the number of self-interested agents increases, the normalized value also increases.
In such cases, the normalized value is larger than 1, and the self-interested agents journey length becomes significantly higher than their journey length, in cases where there are no self-interested agents in the system.
However, the self-interested agent acts differently when the road is in its route.
The self-interested agents can choose how much to lie, that is, they can choose to spread how long (not necessarily the true duration) it takes to traverse certain roads.
Table 1 summarizes the normalized results for the self-interested agents, the gossip agents (those having the same origin and destination points as the self-interested agents, denoted  Gossip - SR, and all other gossip agents, denoted Gossip -  Others) and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration number.
In each of these simulation one agent was randomly selected as a self-interested agent, and then another agent, with the same origin as the  selfinterested agent, was randomly selected as the beneficiary agent.
In the next subsection we describe the simulation results, involving the self-interested agents.
While an agent can also divert cars from its route by falsely reporting congested roads in parallel to its route as free, this behavior is not very likely since other agents,  attempting to use the roads, will find the mistake within a short time and spread the true congestion on the road.
Also, the regular gossip agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another strategy Tg −1, in which their utility value is higher: ug (Ts, Tg −1) = Ts − Tg + 1.
4.3 When Gossiping is Inefficient We continued and modeled our scenario as a game, in  order to find the equilibrium.
As compared to the gossip agents on the same route that have traveled as much as 193% more, when self-interested agents are introduced, the average journey length for the regular agents has only increased by about 15%.
To this end, for all the roads in its route, which the agent has not yet passed, the agent generates a random weight, which is above the  average weight of the roads in the network.
In this simulation, we selected only 6 agents to be part of the group of the self-interested agents, as we wanted to investigate the effect achieved by only a small number of agents.
Still, in most of the iterations, the average journey length of the beneficiary agent is longer than in the case when no lies are spread.
On the other hand, if the self-interested agents spread traversal time which is lower than the threshold, they will gain a positive utility value.
This can be seen, for example, in iterations 4-6, in which the normalized value of the self-interested agents increased above 1.00.
This is due to the fact that the lies are not yet incorporated by other gossip agents.
Since the objective of the self-interested agents is to spread messages as though some roads are jammed, the  traversal time they report is obviously larger than the average time.
Formally, we use us to denote the utility of the self-interested agents and ug to denote the utility of the regular gossip agents.
We refer to the latter agent as the beneficiary agent.
In the second case we have Tavg < Ts < Tg ≤ Tmax.
In this section we first describe the simulations with the self-interested agents.
In addition, to avoid being influenced by its own lies and other lies spreading in the network, all self-interested agents will ignore data received about roads with heavy traffic (note that data about roads that are not heavily traffic will not be ignored)1 .
In the first set of experiments, we created a scenario, in which a small group of self-interested agents spread lies on the same route, and tested its  effect on the journey length of all the agents in the network.
When each agent i ∈ {regular gossip, self-interested} chooses a strategy Ti resulting in a strategy profile T = (Ts, Tg) then agent i obtains a utility of ui (T).
We can see that as the number of iterations advances, the lower the normalized value for the beneficiary agent.
As opposed to the first set of experiments, in this set the self-interested agents were selected randomly, and we did not enforce the constraint that they will all have the same origin and destination points.
If the self-interested agents spread traversal times higher than or equal to the regular gossip cars" threshold, they will not benefit from those lies.
Thus, for this equilibrium point the exchange of  gossiping information between agents is inefficient, as the gossip agents are unable to detect any anomalies in the network.
This is in order to free the path for itself, by making other agents recalculate their paths, this time without including roads on the self-interested agent"s route.
Only when the self-interested agents had repeated their journey in the next iteration (iteration 2) did it help them significantly (p = 0.04).
A strategy profile T∗ ∈ S is a Nash equilibrium if no deviation in the strategy by any single agent is profitable, that is, if for all i, ui (T∗ ) ≥ ui (Ti, T∗ −i).
Basically, the self-interested agent acts the same as the  gossip agent.
Assume, by contradiction, that the gossip agents choose another value Tg > Tavg.
As they started spreading lies about this road, more cars shifted from this route, thus making the road free for the future iterations.
While the gossip agents, which are not on the route of the beneficiary agent, virtually are not affected by the self-interested agent, those on the route and the  regular agents are affected and have higher normalized values.
Using these simulations we examined what the threshold could be for the number of randomly selected self-interested agents in order to allow themselves to benefit from their selfish behavior.
In each simulation 11 runs were made, each run with different numbers of self-interested agents: 0 (no self-interested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.
4.1 Modeling the Self-Interested Agents"  Behavior While the gossip agents gather data and send it to other agents, the self-interested agents" behavior is modeled as follows: 1.
Figure 1 shows the normalized value achieved by the self-interested agents as a function of their number.
We will show that any other tuple (Ts, Tg), such that Tavg < Tg ≤ Tmax and Tavg < Ts ≤ Tmax is not a Nash equilibrium.
On the other hand, if they discard the false values the self-interested agents send, that is, they do not  incorporate the lies, they will gain utility values.
There are two possible types for the agents: (a) regular gossip agents, and (b) self-interested agents.
Motivated by the  results of the simulations we have described above, we saw that the agents are less affected if they discard the heavy traffic values.
On the other hand, if we compare the average journey length in all of the iterations, there is no significant difference between the two settings.
We can also see the impact on the other agents in the system.
This situation occurred since the self-interested agents ignored all heavy traffic data, and thus ignored the fact that the road was jammed.
To model this we randomly selected  selfinterested agents, whose objective was to minimize their average journey length, assuming the cars were repeating their journeys (that is, more than one iteration was made).
In this case, the self-interested agents have an incentive to deviate and choose another  strategy Tg − 1, in which their utility value is higher: us (Tg − 1, Tg) = Tg − 1 − Tavg + 1 = Tg − Tavg > 0.
Also, we have seen in the previous set of experiments and we have  provided explanations as to why the self-interested agents do not gain much from their behavior in the first iteration.
4.2 Simulation Results To test the benefits of cheating by the self-interested agents we ran several experiments.
We can see that up to 8 self-interested agents, the average normalized value is below 1.
It then associates these new weights with the roads in its route and sends them to the other agents.
The self-interested agents also have no incentive to deviate from this strategy.
Since the agent"s goal is to reach its destination as fast as possible, the agent will falsely report that all the roads in its route are heavily congested.
Thus, if we compare the average journey length in the first iteration when lies are spread and when there are no lies, the average is significantly lower when there are no lies (p < 0.03).
In the last case we have Tavg < Ts = Tg ≤ Tmax.
In our third set of experiments we examined a setting in which there was an increasing number of agents, and the agents did not necessarily have the same origin and  destination points.
On the other hand, if an agent manages to persuade other agents not to use a road, it will be harder for them to detect that the said roads are not congested.
That is, they benefit from their malicious behavior.
We analyzed the average journey length of the self-interested agents as opposed to the average journey length of other regular gossip agents traveling along the same route.
This result is even lower than the effect on other gossip agents in the entire network.
Thus, the regular gossip agents have no incentive to  deviate from this strategy.
In addition, one road, on the route of these agents, was randomly selected to be partially blocked, letting only one car go through that road at each time step.
It collects data regarding the weight of the roads (either by traversing the road or by getting the data from other agents) and sends the data it has collected to other agents.
Then, we model the scenario as a The Sixth Intl.
Just like a self-interested agent, the beneficiary agent also ignores all data regarding heavy traffic.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 329 game with two types of agents, and prove that the  equilibrium result can only be achieved when there is no efficient exchange of gossiping information in the network.
The first iteration is not shown  intentionally, as we assume repeated journeys.
This is mainly due to several self-interested agents, who  entered the jammed road.
About 8,000 agents were randomly selected as regular gossip agents, and the other 32,000 agents were  designated as regular agents.
We note that the advantage of using gossiping in  transportation networks is to allow the agents to detect anomalies in the network (e.g., traffic jams) and to quickly adapt to them by recalculating their routes [14].
Using the paired t-test to compare these values with the values achieved by these agents when no lies are used, we see that there is no significant difference between the two scenarios.
Each of these agents is a representative of its group, and thus all agents in the same group have similar behavior.
As in the first set of experiments, 5 simulations were run for each scenario, with a total of 25 simulations.
Now we construct the utility functions for each type of agents, which is defined by the values of Ts and Tg.
The self-interested agents adopted a cheating approach, in which they sent false data to their peers.
The other 8,000 and 32,000 agents were designated as regular gossip agents and regular agents, respectively.
In real-life this can be modeled, for  example, by a husband, who would like to help his wife find a faster route to her destination.
As in the previous sets of experiments we ran 5  different simulations per scenario.
332 The Sixth Intl.
In the first Tavg < Tg < Ts ≤ Tmax.
However, we also recall that the self-interested agents  ignore all information about the heavy traffic roads.
Let Tavg be the average time it takes to traverse an edge in the transportation network (that is, the average load of an edge).
We also assume that sophisticated methods for identifying the self-interested agents or  managing reputation are not used.
The figure shows these values for iterations 2-6.
We also denote the strategy profile in the game as {Ts, Tg}.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 331 there are 2, 4, 8 and 16 self-interested agents there is no significance difference.
First we will show that (Tavg, Tavg) is a Nash  equilibrium.
We will now show that the above solution is unique.
Let Tmax be the maximum time it takes to  traverse an edge.
Table 2 summarizes the  normalized values for the different agents.
Each agent adopted the behavior modeled in Section 4.1.
Thus, us (Ts, Tg) = 0 and ug (Ts, Tg) = Tg − Tavg.
We have three cases.
Thus, 330 The Sixth Intl.
Thus, us (Ts , Tavg) = 0, while us (Tavg, Tavg) = 0.
Calculate the shortest path from origin to destination.
(Tavg, Tavg) is the only Nash equilibrium.
On the other hand, ug (Tavg, Tavg) = 0.
Thus, ug (Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg < 0.
Thus, ug (Tavg, Tg ) = Tavg − Tg < 0.
We now have the following theorem.
Thus, us (Ts, Tg) = Ts − Tg = 0.
