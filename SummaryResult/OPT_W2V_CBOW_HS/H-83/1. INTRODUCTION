In the context of a localized search engine, if the PageRanks are computed using only the local subgraph, then we would  expect the resulting PageRanks to reflect the perceived  popularity within the local community and not of the web as a whole.
By restricting themselves to smaller, more manageable sections of the web, localized search engines can also provide more precise and complete search capabilities over their respective domains.
We construct this supergraph by iteratively crawling global pages on the current web frontier-i.e., global pages with inlinks from pages that have already been crawled.
Section 2 gives an overview of localized search engines and outlines their  advantages over global search.
A person wishing to research the opinions on global warming within the conservative political community may encounter  numerous such opinions across various websites.
Section 4 formally defines our problem, and section 5 presents our page selection criteria and derives our algorithms.
In this work, we present a method of approximating the global PageRanks of a local domain while only using resources of the same  order as those needed to compute the PageRanks of the local subgraph.
Thus, for many localized search engines, incorporating global PageRanks can improve the quality of search results.
In order to provide 116 Research Track Paper a good approximation to the global PageRanks, care must be taken when choosing which pages to crawl next; in this paper, we present a well-motivated page selection algorithm that also performs well empirically.
In general, the PageRank of a given page is  dependent on pages throughout the entire web graph.
Compared to the web graph crawled and indexed by large-scale search engines, the size of such local communities is typically orders of magnitude smaller.
Consequently, the computational resources needed to build such a search engine are also similarly lighter.
For example, consider a localized search engine that indexes political pages with conservative views.
Finally, we empirically demonstrate that, given a local domain of size n, we can provide good approximations to the global PageRank values by crawling at most n or 2n additional pages.
Section 6 provides  experimental results, section 7 gives an overview of related work, and, finally, conclusions are given in section 8. 
Localized search engines are small-scale search engines that index only a single community of the web.
To evaluate performance, we measure the difference between the current global PageRank estimate and the global PageRank, as a function of the number of pages crawled.
We experiment across several types of local subgraphs, including four topic related communities and several  sitespecific domains.
Localized search engines do not have the bandwidth, storage capacity, or computational power to crawl, download, and compute the global PageRanks of the entire web.
Our proposed method looks for a supergraph of our local subgraph such that the local PageRanks within this  supergraph are close to the true global PageRanks.
This algorithm is  derived from a well-defined problem objective and has a  running time linear in the number of local nodes.
One drawback of localized indexes is the lack of global information needed to compute link-based rankings.
Such  communities can be site-specific domains, such as pages within the cs.utexas.edu domain, or topic-related  communitiesfor example, political websites.
However, the number of pages a local search engine indexes is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the number of pages indexed by their large-scale counterparts.
We compare our algorithm against several heuristics and also against a baseline algorithm that chooses pages at random, and we show that our method outperforms these other methods.
The PageRank algorithm [3], has proven to be an effective such measure.
However, if global PageRanks are also available, then the results can  additionally reflect outsiders" views of the conservative  community (those documents that liberals most often access within the conservative community).
If only local  PageRank values are available, then the search results will reflect only strongly held beliefs within the community.
Section 3 provides background on the PageRank algorithm.
The paper is organized as follows.
