This method first chooses a random starting vector r(0) , and iteratively multiplies the current vector by the PageRank matrix PU ; see Algorithm 1.
By  exploiting the sparsity of the PageRank matrix, the work per iteration can be reduced to O(km), where k is the average number of links per web page.
We define the PageRank matrix PU to be: PU = αUD−1 U + (1 − α)veT , (1) where DU is the (unique) diagonal matrix such that UD−1 U is column stochastic, α is a given scalar such that 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, e is the vector of all ones, and v is a non-negative,  L1normalized vector, sometimes called the ‘random surfer"  vector.
Let U be an m × m adjacency matrix for a given web graph such that Uji = 1 if page i links to page j and Uji = 0 otherwise.
Choose (randomly) an initial non-negative vector r(0) such that r(0) 1 = 1. i ← 0 repeat i ← i + 1 ν ← αUD−1 U r(i−1) {α is the random surfing  probability} r(i) ← ν + (1 − α)v {v is the random surfer vector.}
In each step of the random walk, the ‘surfer" either follows an outlink from the current page (i.e.
The PageRank vector r is the dominant eigenvector of the PageRank matrix, r = PU r. We will assume, without loss of generality, that r has an L1-norm of one.
Note that the matrix D−1 U is well-defined only if each column of U has at least one non-zero entry-i.e., each page in the webgraph has at least one outlink.
However, in practice, the number of links in a web graph will be of the order of the number of pages.
Thus, the PageRank algorithm uses what is sometimes referred to as the ‘random surfer" model.
In general, each iteration of the power method can take O(m2 ) operations when PU is a dense  matrix.
[3], is to replace each zero column of U by a non-negative, L1-normalized vector.
the current node in the chain), or jumps to a random page on the web.
Finally, the total space needed is also O(km), mainly to store the matrix U.
It has also been shown that the total number of iterations needed for convergence is  proportional to α and does not depend on the size of the web graph [11, 7].
Computationally, r can be computed using the power method.
The algorithm works by building a Markov chain from the link structure of the web graph and computing its stationary distribution.

The PageRank algorithm defines the importance of web pages by analyzing the underlying hyperlink structure of a web graph.
One way to compute the  stationary distribution of a Markov chain is to find the limiting distribution of a random walk over the chain.
In the presence of such ‘dangling nodes" that have no outlinks, one commonly used solution, proposed by Brin et al.
We now precisely define the PageRank problem.
