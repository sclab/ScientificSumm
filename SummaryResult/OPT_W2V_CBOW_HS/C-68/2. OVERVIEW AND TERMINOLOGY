The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.
Si Size of data item i fi Frequency of access to data item i. Replication Parameters Ri Normalized frequency of access to data item i ri Number of replicas for data item i n Characterizes a particular replication scheme.
Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 
Assume a network of N AutoMata-equipped cars, each with storage capacity of α bytes.
The number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri = min (N, max (1, Ri·N·α Si )).
Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the client"s request for any data item i will be satisfied.
We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.
In cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (N, max (0, Ri·N·α Si )).
δi Average availability latency of data item i δagg Aggregate availability latency, δagg = T j=1 δj · fj AutoMata System Parameters G Number of cells in the map (2D-torus).
We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by Ri, as: Ri = (fi)n T j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.
This serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when  zebroids are deployed.
The frequency of access to data item i is denoted as fi, with T j=1 fj = 1.
In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.
Let the trip duration of the client AutoMata under consideration be γ.
This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.
There are T data items in the database, each with Database Parameters T Number of data items.
Ri is normalized to a value between 0 and 1.
This indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.
γ Trip duration of the client AutoMata.
N Number of AutoMata devices in the system.
However, in most practical circumstances γ may not be so large as to find every data item.
The total storage capacity of the  system is ST =N ·α.
A square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5].
α Storage capacity per AutoMata.
If this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ.

Table 1 summarizes the notation of the parameters used in the paper.
ST Total storage capacity of the AutoMata system, ST = N · α.
Below we introduce some terminology used in the paper.
