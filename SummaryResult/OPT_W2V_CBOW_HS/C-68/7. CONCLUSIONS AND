FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this study, we examined the improvements in latency that can be obtained in the presence of carriers that deliver a data item from a server to a client.
We are currently  analyzing the performance of zebroids on a real world data set  comprising of an ad-hoc network of buses moving around a small  neighborhood in Amherst [4].
This will also serve as a validation for the utility of the Markov mobility model used in this study.
To better reflect reality we would like to validate the observations obtained from this study with some real world  simulation traces of vehicular movements (for example using  CORSIM [1]).
Extensions to zebroids that satisfy such application  requirements presents an interesting future research direction. 
Zebroids may also be used for delivery of data items that carry delay sensitive information with a certain expiry.
Below we summarize some key future research directions we  intend to pursue.
We quantified the variation in availability  latency as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per car, title database size, and replacement policies  employed by zebroids.
