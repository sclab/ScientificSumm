In this paper the authors discussed  mediators for a two-person game, which is known to the players but not to the mediators, and they looked for Nash  equilibrium in the new game generated by the mediator.
Notice that we assume that the multi-agent interaction (formalized as a game) is given, and all the mediator can do is to perform actions on behalf of the agents that explicitly allow it to do so.2 In order to illustrate the power of mediators for games with incomplete information consider the following pre-Bayesian game G that does not possess an ex post equilibrium.
One such mediator has already been discussed for other purposes in the literature: An English auction type of algorithm was constructed in [3] that takes as an input the valuations of the players and outputs bids for the next-price position auction.
The mediator generates a new pre-Bayesian game,which is called the mediated game.
We believe that such mediators are not realistic, and therefore we concentrate on the search for valid  mediators that generate an ex post equilibrium and satisfy the additional rationality condition: an agent"s payoff can not be negative regardless of the actions taken by the agents who did not choose the mediator"s services, or agents who report false types to the mediator.
It was proved there that  reporting the true type to this algorithm by each player forms an ex post equilibrium, which generates the VCG outcome.
A mediator is a reliable entity that can interact with the players and perform on their behalf actions in a given game.
Another type of mediators is discussed in [13].
In the mediated game player 1 has three actions: Give the mediator the right of play, denoted by m, or play directly a or b.
A strategy of player 2 is a function g2 : {A, B} → {a, b}.That is, player 2 has 4 strategies.
In G, the column player has two possible types: A and B. a b a 5, 2 3, 0 b 0, 0 2, 2 A a b a 2, 2 0, 0 b 3, 0 5, 2 B A mediator for G should specify the actions it will choose on behalf of the players that give it the right to play.
The mediated game is described in the following figure: m − A m − B a b m 5, 2 2, 2 5, 2 3, 0 a 3, 0 5, 2 5, 2 3, 0 b 2, 2 0, 0 0, 0 2, 2 A 1 For games with complete information the main interest is in leading agents to behaviors, which are stable against  deviations by coalitions.
The game is denoted by H. a b a 5, 2 3, 0 b 0, 0 4, 2 A a b a 2, 2 0, 0 b 3, 3 5, 2 B At the game H there are two players.
What is missing, is a  component that punishes players who send their bids directly to the auctioneer, and a proof that using the mediator services and reporting the true type by each player is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game defined by the algorithm and by the additional component.
Indeed, an agent is free to participate in the game without the help of the mediator.
The leading solution concept for pre-Bayesian games is the ex post  equilibrium: A profile of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has a profitable deviation independently of the types of the other players.
Consider the following mediator: If both players give the mediator the right of play, then the mediator will play on their behalf (a, a) if player 2 reports A and (b, b) if player 2 reports B.
In this paper we introduce another use of mediators, in establishing  behaviors which are stable against unilateral deviations in games with incomplete information.
Mediators that can obtain the right of play but can not enforce the use of their services have been already defined and discussed for games with complete information in [14].1 The topic of mediators for games with complete information has been further generalized and analyzed in [16].
We prove the existence of such desired mediators for the next-price (Google-like) position auctions5 , as well as for a richer class of position auctions, including all k-price position auctions, k > 1.
The column player, player 2, has a private type, A or B (player 1 has only one possible type).
Both players can choose among two actions: a and b.
m − A m − B a b m 2, 2 5, 2 2, 2 0, 0 a 0, 0 2, 2 2, 2 0, 0 b 5, 2 3, 0 3, 0 5, 2 B It is now easy to verify that giving the mediator the right of play, and reporting truthfully, is an ex-post equilibrium at the mediated game.
We therefore suggest the use of mediators in order to attempt and implement the output of the VCG position auction, by transforming other (and in particular current) position auctions into a VCG position auction.4 More specifically, the mediated game will have an ex post equilibrium, which generates the outcome of the VCG position auction.
We introduce mediators for games with incomplete information, and apply them in the context of position auctions.
4 In general, except for the VCG position auction we do not expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium (see Footnote 7).
The mediator"s  behavior on behalf of the agents that give it the right of play is pre-specified, and is conditioned on information the agents would provide to the mediator.
In this conference version we make the formal  definition of mediators and implementing by mediation for the special case of position auctions, and only in the full version we present the general theory of mediators for pre-Bayesian games.
Consider an interaction in a multi-agent system, in which every player holds some private information, which is called the player"s type.
Our choice of positions  auctions as the domain of application is not an accident; indeed, positions auctions have become a central issue in  advertisement and the selection of appropriate position auctions for that task is a subject of considerable amount of study [17, 3, 9, 4].3 Current position auctions however do not possess ex-post equilibrium, i.e.
Position auctions are a restricted type of general pre-Bayesian games.
If player 2 wants to give the mediator the right to play it should also report a type.
In our language this algorithm can be almost considered as a mediator for the next-price position auction that implement the VCG outcome function.
Consider the following simple example of a pre-Bayesian game, which possesses an ex post equilibrium.
In this game the strategy profile (g1, g2) is an ex post equilibrium, where g1 = b and g2(A) = b, g2(B) = a.
A mediator may generate a desired outcome by punishing the players who do not use its services with very high bids by the players that use its services.
A special case of mediators was already discussed in [8].
2 This natural setting is different from the one discussed in the classical theories of implementation and mechanism  design, where a designer designs a new game from scratch in order to yield some desired behavior.
If only player 1 gives the mediator the right of play then the mediator will choose a on his behalf.
In contrast, in the VCG position auction, which is currently not used in practice, there is a truth-revealing ex post equilibrium, which yields optimal surplus.
Every player has a set of actions, and a strategy of a player is a function that maps each of its possible types to an action.
The simplest form of a mediator discussed in the game theory literature is captured by the notion of correlated equilibrium [1].
However, a mediator can not enforce  behavior.
Player 2 has four actions: m − A, m − B,a,b, where m − A (m − B) means reporting A (B) to the mediator and give it the right of play.
If only player 2 gives the mediator the right of play, the mediator will choose action a (resp.
However, in all these settings the mediator can not perform actions on behalf of the agents that allow it to do so.
This game is called a Bayesian game, when a commonly known probability measure on the profiles of types is added to the system.
Otherwise it is called a pre-Bayesian game.
Unfortunately, pre-Bayesian games do not, in general,  possess ex post equilibria, even if we allow mixed strategies.
For example, in an auction interaction the type of a player is its valuation, or, in more complex auctions, its valuation function.
solutions which are stable against unilateral deviations regardless of the agents" private  information, nor guarantee optimal social surplus.
A strategy of player 1 is g1,where g1 = a or g1 = b.
In this paper we deal only with pre-Bayesian games.
Mediators in one-item auctions (in particular first price and second price auctions) have been already discussed in [6, 11, 2]; however they all used a Bayesian model.
This interaction is modeled as a game with incomplete information.
280 istence of such mediator depends on the tie breaking rule used in the auction.
This notion is highly  natural; in many systems there is some form of reliable party or 279 administrator that can be used as a mediator.
This notion was generalized to communication equilibrium by [5, 15].
In order to address this problem we suggest in this paper the use of mediators.
For k=1, the self-price position auction, we show that the  ex3 See also [12], where position auctions are titled ad auctions.
That is, (f1, f2) is an ex post  equilibrium, where f1 = m, and f2(A) = m−A, f2(B) = m−B.
5 Our proof uses an algorithm, which is different from the algorithm in [3] discussed earlier.
