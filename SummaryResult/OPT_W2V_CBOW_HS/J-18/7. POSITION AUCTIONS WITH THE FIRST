More specifically: Definition: Let G be a position auction with the  firstarrival rule, and let m be a directed mediator for G. The 11 It is clear however, that the resulting order γ is consistent with the well-defined order of bids of N \ i. T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium with respect to m if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions hold: F1: i is not better off when he gives the directed mediator the right of play and reports a false type.
However, all mediators discussed in this paper will use the same rule to determine the order of bids: If all players report the vector of types ˆv, the  mediator uses the order of bids γˆv , which is defined as follows: γˆv i < γˆv k if and only if ˆvi > ˆvk, or ˆvi = ˆvk and i < k. For example, if n = 3 and the reported types are ˆv = (6, 7, 6), then γˆv = (2, 1, 3).
A directed mediator for G is valid, if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a non-negative level of utility.
For every order of bids γ and a vector of bids b we define s(b, γ, i) as the position assigned to i.
On the other hand, when this player sends a bid directly to the auctioneer, the resulting outcome is not clear, because the order of bids is not clear.11 A good desired directed mediator would be one that no player would want to deviate from the T strategy  independently of the order in which the bids are recorded because of his deviation.
ARRIVAL RULE Let G be a position auction with the first-arrival rule.
That is for every bi ∈ Bi, and for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the order of bids of members of N \ i resulting from the vector of types v−i, wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i) ) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\i(v−i)), γ).
Formally, a directed mediator m for G is valid, if for every player i with type vi, for every subset S ⊆ N such that i ∈ S, for every vS\i, and for every b−S, wi(vi, mS(vS), b−S, γ) ≥ 0 for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the standard order of bids of S determined by the mediator when the reported types are vS.
If the following conditions hold then there exists a valid directed mediator for G that implements the VCG outcome function in G. 1.
For every j ∈ K and every b1 , b2 ∈ B such that b1 (l) = b2 (l) for every l ≥ j, pj(b1 ) = pj(b2 ).
Our previous results remain true for directed mediators for position auctions with the first arrival rule.
We denote the payment of i when the vector of bids is b and the order of bidding is γ by qi(b, γ) = ps(b,γ,i)(b), and we denote wi(vi, b, γ) the utility of i.
Every mediator for G has the ability to determine the order in which the bids he submits on behalf of the players are recorded; He can just submit the bids sequentially, waiting for a confirmation before submitting the next bid.
Next we show that in contrast to Theorem 6, it is possible to implement the VCG outcome function in every self-price position auction with the first-arrival rule.
A mediator for a position auction with the first arrival rule is therefore defined by a vector m = (mS)S⊆N .
That is, for every ˆvi ∈ Vi wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i) ) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i), γ(ˆvi,v−i) ).
Every order of bidding can be described by some γ ∈ Γ; i bids before k if and only if γi < γk.
To summarize: If all players use the directed mediator m, and the reported bids are ˆv, then the directed mediator bids mN (ˆv)i on behalf of i, i receives the position s(ˆv, γˆv , i), and pays qi(mN (ˆv), γˆv ).
If only the subset S uses the  mediator"s services, the reported types are ˆvS, and the other players bid directly b−S then the actual order of bids is not uniquely determined.
Let G = G(α, p) be the self-price position auction with the first arrival rule.
If this order is γ then the position of i ∈ N is s(b, γ, i), and its payment is qi(b, γ), where b = (mS(ˆvS), b−S).
If only a strict subset of the players use the mediator"s services, the mediator applies the same order of bids rule to this subset.
Let G = G(α, p) be a position auction with the first-arrival rule.
A mediator for G should determine the bids of the players who use its services and also the order of bids as a function of the reported types.
Assume all players but i use the T strategy.
There exists a valid  directed mediator that implements the VCG outcome function in G. In the following theorem we provide sufficient conditions for implementing that the VCG outcome function in a  position auction with the first-arrival rule.
If player i deviates from the T strategy by reporting a false type to the directed mediator, the resulting outcome is well-defined.
For every v ∈ V there exists b ∈ B such that pj(b) = v(j) for every j ∈ K. 2.
F2: i is not better off when he bids directly independently of the resulting order of recorded bids.
The notion of valid directed mediators is analogously  defined: Definition: Let G be a position auction with the  firstarrival rule.
3. pj(b) ≥ pj+1(b) for every j ∈ K and every b ∈ B.
The notion of implementation by mediation remains as before: The directed mediator m implements the VCG  outcome function in G if ψm = ϕvcg .
Hence, an order of bids can serve as a priority rule.
In particular, if every player is using the T-strategy and the players" profile of types is v, then the outcome generated by the directed mediator is ψm (v) = (s(v, γv ), q(mN (v), γv ).
However, such a mediator is called a directed mediator in order to stress the fact that it  determines not only the bids but also the order of bids.
But why should the players use the T strategy?
A special  characteristic of auctions satisfying these sufficient conditions is that players" payments may depend also on their own bid, in contrast to the auctions discussed in Theorem 3.
The long proof of this theorem is in the spirit of all previous proofs, and therefore it is omitted.
G is monotone.
We need the following notations.
