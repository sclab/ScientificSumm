We first show it for s(v, i) = 1, that is δ(v, 1) = i.
We define a mediator m, which will implement the VCG outcome function in G: For every v ∈ V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is defined as follows: For every player i such that 2 ≤ s(v, i) ≤ m let bi(v) = pvcg s(v,i)−1(v).8 For every i ∈ δ(v, m + 1), bi(v) = pvcg m (v).
Observe that for every player i such that s(b(v), i) ∈ K ps(b(v),i)(b(v)) = pvcg s(v,i)(v).
If j /∈ K then player i"s 8 Recall that s(b, i) denotes the position of player i under the bid profile b, and δ(b, j) denotes the set of players assigned to position j.
Suppose j ∈ K. Then αk(vi − pk(b(v))) = αk(vi − pvcg k (v)) ≥ αj(vi − pvcg j (v−i, bi)) ≥ αj(vi − v(j+1)), where the first equality follows from ϕm = ϕvcg , the first inequality follows since VCG is truthful, and the second  inequality follows from the first part of Lemma 1.
If s(v, i) > 1, we  distinguish between two cases.
Since pj is position j"s payment function in the next-price position auction, αj(vi − v(j+1)) = αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)).
If all players choose the mediator then by the first part of Lemma 1 each player which uses the T-strategy will not pay more than his value.
AUCTIONS We now show that there exists a valid mediator, which  implements the VCG outcome function in next-price position auctions.
Hence, ϕm = ϕvcg .
1. pvcg j (b) ≤ b(j+1) for every j ∈ K. 2. pvcg j (b) ≥ pvcg j+1(b) for every j = 1, ..., m − 1 and for every b ∈ B, where for every j, equality holds if and only if b(j+1) = b(j+2) = · · · = b(m+1).
This completes the description of the mediator m. We show that ϕm (v) = ϕvcg (v) for every v ∈ V .
That is v(j+1) = vi, and therefore by the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg s(v,i)(v).
Let k = s(v, i).
Next we show that it is not beneficial for a single player i ∈ N to participate in the auction directly if all other players use the T-strategy.
There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G. Theorem 2 follows from a more general theorem given in the next section.
Therefore αk(vi − pk(b(v))) ≥ αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)).
Therefore, since ϕm = ϕvcg , s(b(v), i) = k. Let j be player i"s position in the deviation.
Since s(v, i) < s(v, l), the fixed priority rule implies that i < l. By the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v).
Let j + 1 = s(v, i).
Finally we show that m is valid.
Note that by the truthfulness of VCG, it is not beneficial for any player i to miss report her value to the mediator, given that all other players use the T-strategy.
In this case bδ(v,1)(v) > bj(v) for every j = i, s(b(v), i) = 1.
It is sufficient to show that whenever 1 ≤ s(v, i) < s(v, l) ≤ m + 1 for some i = l, then s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
Whenever j ∈ K, we slightly abuse notations, and also refer to δ(b, j) as the player that is assigned to position j.
This completes the proof that s(b(v)) = s(v) for all v ∈ V .
The proof of Lemma 1 is given in the full version.
Since s(v, i) ≤ s(v, l) − 1, by the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v).
Let bi be player i"s bid.
Therefore qi(b(v)) = qvcg i (v) for every i ∈ N. This shows that q(b(v)) = qvcg (v) for all v ∈ V .
Since the mediator submits the reported values on behalf of the other players, these other players will not pay more than their reported values.
Therefore pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg s(v,l)−1(v), which yields bi(v) > bl(v).
Let v ∈ V be an arbitrary valuation vector.
Therefore bi(v) ≥ bl(v), which yields s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
We proceed to prove that the T-strategy is an ex-post equilibrium.
We have to show that s(b(v)) = s(v) and that q(b(v)) = qvcg (v): We begin by showing that s(b(v)) = s(v).
Assume that player i is the only player that participates directly in the auction.
Lemma 1.
Hence j = s((v−i, bi), i).
Let bδ(v,1)(v) = 1 + max{i:s(v,i)≥2}bi(v).
Although in the following section we prove a more general result, we present this result first, given the  importance of next-price position auctions in the literature and in practice.
Hence, v−i is the vector of bids submitted by the mediator.
Therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
We can now show: Theorem 2.
Therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
Fix some v ∈ V .
Let pvcg be the VCG payment scheme.
Let G be a next-price position auction.
However, we still provide a proof since a more simple and intuitive mediator is constructed for this case.
Proof of Theorem 2.
283 utility is zero and therefore deviating is not worthwhile for i.
For every S ⊆ N such that S = N and for every vS ∈ VS let mS(v) = vS.
Hence, player i does not gain from participating directly in the auction.
Hence a player which used the T-strategy will not pay more than his value.
1. vi = vl.
Our proof makes use of the following technical lemma.
Consider the situation in which a subset of players, S,  participate directly in the auction.
2. vi > vl.
