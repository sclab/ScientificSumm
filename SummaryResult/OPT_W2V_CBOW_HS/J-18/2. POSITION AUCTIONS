That is, bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and only if i < k. Given this fixed priority rule we can make the following definitions, which apply to all position auctions: We denote by s(b, i) the position player i is assigned to when the bid profile is b.
If i holds a position then every visitor to this position gives i a revenue of vi > 0, where vi is called the valuation of i.
Hence, the action set of player i in the mediated game is Bi ∪Vi, where conveniently Vi denotes both, (0, ∞) , and a copy of (0, ∞), which is disjoint from 6 We use the standard payment function of the VCG  mechanism.
It is useful to define for every position auction two dummy positions m + 1 and −1, which more than one player may be assigned to.
That is for every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B pj(b) = b(j+1) (2) VCG position auctions: In a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) position auction the payment function for position j ∈ K is defined as follows.6 For every b ∈ B pvcg j (b) = Pm+1 k=j+1 b(k)(αk−1 − αk) αj (3) Note that the VCG position auction is not the next-price position auction unless there is only one position and α1 = 1.
Self-price position auctions: Each player who is assigned to a position with a positive click-through rate pays his own bid.
Every vector of bids b and a permutation γ uniquely determine an allocation.
The T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions hold: E1: i is not better off when he gives the mediator the right of play and report a false type.
An assignment of players to positions is called an  allocation.
2.1 Tie breaking rules In practice, the most commonly used tie breaking rule is the First-Arrival rule: if a set of players submit the same bid, their priority in receiving the positions is determined by the times their bids were recorded; An earlier bid receives a higher priority.
Anonymity is modeled by the requirement that for every two bid profiles b, d ∈ B, p(b) = p(d) whenever b∗ = d∗ .
More specifically, let Γ be the set of all permutations, γ = (γ1, ..., γn) of N. Every such γ defines a priority rule as follows: i has a higher priority than k if and only if γi < γk.
The utility function for player i, wi : Vi × B → R+ is defined as follows: wi(vi, b) = αs(b,i)(vi − qi(b)) = αs(b,i)(vi − ps(b,i)(b)).
That is for every bi ∈ Bi, wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i)) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\i(v−i))).
Hence, an allocation is a vector s = (s1, s2, · · · , sn) with si ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} such that if si ∈ K then si = sl for every l = i; si is the position of player i.
This is modeled as follows: Let b ∈ B = B1 × B2 × · · · × Bn be a bid profile.
For example if b = (3, 7, 3, 0, 2) then b(1) = 7, b(2) = 3, b(3) = 3, b(4) = 2, b(5) = 0.
That is, for every j ∈ K and every b ∈ B pj(b) = b(j) (1) Next-price position auctions: In this auction (run with a slight variation by Google), every player who is assigned to a position with a positive click-through rate pays the bid of the player assigned to the position right after him if there is such a player, and zero otherwise.
All players, who  participate in the auction but do not get a position in K are assigned to position m + 1 and all players who choose not to participate are assigned to position −1.
2.4 Mediators for position auctions We denote by G = G(α, p) the position auction with the click-through rate vector α and the payment scheme p. Recall that the set of types of i is Vi = (0, ∞).
Therefore, a player with a bid 0 is not assigned to any  position, and it pays 0.
That is, for every position j there exists a real-valued function ˜pj defined over all ordered vectors of bids such that for every b ∈ B pj(b) = ˜pj(b∗ ).
For each position j there is a commonly-known number αj > 0, which is interpreted as the expected number of visitors at that position.
We assume that bidding 0 is a symbol for non-participation.
Given the above, a position auction is defined by its tie breaking rule, which determines the allocation in case of ties, and by its payment scheme.
Let G be a position  auction with a position payment scheme p. For every player i we denote qi(b) = ps(b,i)(b), 281 and q(b) = (q1(b), q2(b), · · · qn(b)).
That is, for every ˆvi ∈ Vi wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i)) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i)).
In this game every player i receives his type vi and can either send a type, ˆvi (not necessarily the true type) to the  mediator, or send a bid directly to the auction.
That is pj(b) ≤ b(j) for every b ∈ B and for every j ∈ K. It is convenient in certain cases to describe the payment functions indexed by the players.
We call the vector of payment functions pα = (pα j )j∈K the position payment scheme.
In a position auction there is a seller who sells a finite number of positions j ∈ K = {1, ..., m}.
For  convenience, a position auction will be described either by its position payment scheme or by its player payment scheme.
Let V = V1 × V2 × · · · × Vn be the set of profile of types, and for every S ⊆ N let VS = ×i∈SVi.
When the priority rule γ is told to the players before they make their bids, the tie breaking rule is called a fixed priority rule.
Whenever the T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in Gm, the mediator m implements an outcome function in G. This outcome function is denoted by ϕm , and it is defined as follows: ϕm (v) = (s(mN (v)), q(mN (v)).
In all position auctions we consider, the player with the highest positive bid receives the first position, the player with the second highest positive bid receives the second  position, and so on.
Each position j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} is associated with a payment function, pα j : B → R+, where pα j (b) is the payment for position j when the bid profile is b.
The set of possible valuations of i is Vi = (0, ∞).
2.2 The payment schemes Let α be a click-trough rate vector.
The allocation determined by b is denoted by s(b) = (s(b, 1), s(b, 2), · · · , s(b, n)).
the players" payments to the auctioneer are not influenced by their identities.
An auctioneer who is using the random priority rule chooses a fixed priority rule γ by randomizing uniformly over Γ.
We denote by b(j) the jth highest bid in b.
That is, if player i is assigned to position j and pays pi per click then his utility is αj(vi − pi).
A general VCG mechanism may be obtained from the standard one by adding an additional payment function to each player, which depends only on the types of the other players.
We assume that the players" utility functions are  quasilinear.
We further assume that a player never pays more than his bid.
Dealing with a fixed priority rule simplifies notations and proofs, and in most cases, and in particular in this paper, results that are obtained with this tie breaking rule are identical to the results obtained with the random priority rule.
Every player is required to submit a bid, bi ∈ Bi = [0, ∞).
Naturally we assume that pα −1 is identically zero.
We introduce the following terminology: The T-strategy for a player in the mediated game is the strategy, in which this player uses the mediator"s services and reports his true value to the mediator.
For every j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} we denote by δ(b, j) the set of players assigned to position j.
Remark: Whenever α is fixed or its value is clear from the context we will allow ourselves to omit the superscript α from the payment and other functions.
In auction theory this tie breaking rule is typically modelled by assuming that the auctioneer is using a random priority rule.
If S is the set of players that send a type to the mediator, the mediator bids on their behalf mS(ˆvS).
We call q the player payment scheme.
Without loss of generality we assume that the fixed  priority rule is defined by the natural order, ˜γ = (1, 2, ..., n).
Hence, a participant who is not assigned a real position pays nothing.
We denote b∗ = (b(1), · · · , b(n)).
Note that for j ∈ K, δ(b, j) contains at most one player.
However, we also assume that pα m+1 is identically zero.
We assume that there are more bidders than positions, i.e.
Unless we say specifically otherwise we assume in this  paper a fixed priority rule.
Hence, the range of the function ϕm is the Cartesian product of the set of allocations with Rn +. 
αj is called the click-through rate of position j.
However, the resulting priority rule is not told to the players before they make their bids.
All our assumptions about the position payment schemes can be transformed to analogous assumptions about the player payment schemes.
The T-strategy profile is the profile of strategies in which every player is using the T-strategy.
For j > n we let b(j) = 0.
There is a finite number of (potential) bidders i ∈ N = {1, ..., n}.
2.3 Central position auctions We next describe the payment schemes of three central position auctions.
Note that the correspondence p → q is one-to-one.
The mediator m generates a  preBayesian game Gm, which is called the mediated game.
E2: i is not better off when he bids directly.
We also define αm+1 = α−1 = 0.
According to this  terminology we actually deal with VC position auctions.
We deal with anonymous position payment schemes, i.e.
A mediator for G is a vector of functions m = (mS)S⊆N , where mS : VS → BS.
n > m. The positions are sold for a fixed period of time.
Therefore we will assume this tie breaking rule.
In contrast, in Section 7 we discuss a non-standard approach for analyzing directly the first-arrival tie breaking rule.
Some authors (see e.g., [7]) call the standard VCG mechanism, the VC mechanism.
However, we decided to use the more common terminology.
We assume that α1 > α2 > αm > 0.
These are discussed below.
