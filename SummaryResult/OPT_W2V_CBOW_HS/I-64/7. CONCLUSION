We have also evaluated the performance of the organizations generated by the agents following our approach with the bespoke organization formation that takes place in the Contract Net protocol and have demonstrated that our approach is better than the Contract Net approach as evident by the larger number of tasks completed, larger quality achieved and lower response time.
Finally, we tested the performance of three different resource allocation heuristics on various performance metrics and also evaluated the robustness of our approach. 
In this paper, we have presented a run-time approach to  organization in which the agents use Organizational Self-Design to come up with a suitable organizational structure.
