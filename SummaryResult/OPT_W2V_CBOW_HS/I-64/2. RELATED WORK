Other approaches to OSD include the work of So and Durfee [14], who describe a top-down model of OSD in the context of Cooperative Distributive Problem Solving (CDPS) and Barber and Martin [1], who describe an adaptive decision making framework in which agents are able to reorganize decision-making groups by dynamically changing (1) who makes the decisions for a particular goal and (2) who must carry out these decisions.The latter work is primarily concerned with coordination decisions and can be used to complement our OSD work, which primarily deals with task and resource allocation. 
Hence, our approach also deals with explicit organization formation and the coordination of the agents" tasks which are not handled by their approach.
OSD is used in their work to change the interaction patterns between the agents and results in the agents  using different subtasks or different resources to achieve their goals.
Our research primarily builds on the work done by Gasser and Ishida [10], in which they use OSD in the context of a  production system in order to perform adaptive work allocation and load balancing.
According to their scheme, the type of reorganization done by our agents falls into the category of  structural changes and the reorganization decision can be described as shared command.
Hence, agent cloning can be thought of as akin to agent spawning in our approach.
[8] have described OSD in the context of the reorganization of agent societies and attempt to classify the various kinds of reorganization possible according to the the reason for  reorganization, the type of reorganization and who is responsible for the reorganization decision.
However, their approach assumes a fixed number of agents with  designated (and fixed) roles.
In this approach, the authors present agent cloning as a possible response to agent overload - if an agent detects that it is overloaded and that there are spare (unused) resources in the system, the agent clones itself and gives its clone some part of its task load.
Horling and Lesser [9] present a different, top-down approach to OSD that also uses TÆMS as the underlying representation.
The concept of OSD is not new and has been around since the work of Corkill and Lesser on the DVMT system[4], even though the concept was not fully developed by them.
However, the two approaches are  different in that there is no specialization of the agents in the  formerthe cloned agents are perfect replicas of the original agents and  fulfill the same roles and responsibilities as the original agents.
In our approach, on the other hand, the spawned agents are specialized on a subpart of the spawning agent"s task structure, which is no longer the responsibility of the spawning agent.
The main difference between their work and our work is that we use TÆMS as the underlying representation for our problems, which allows, firstly, the representation of a larger, more general class of problems and, secondly, quantitative reasoning over task structures.
The latter also allows us to incorporate different design-to-criteria schedulers [16].
al.,[13] on Agent Cloning, which is another approach to resource allocation and load balancing.
In their approach, they define two organizational  primitives - composition and decomposition, which are similar to our  organizational primitives for agent spawning and composition.
We also extend on the work done by Sycara et.
