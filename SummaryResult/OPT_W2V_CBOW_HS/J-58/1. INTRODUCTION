More generally, we study how to design truthful mechanisms for binary demand games where the allocation of an agent is either selected or not selected.
We complement this existence theorem with a general framework to design such a payment scheme P. Furthermore, we present general techniques to compute the payment when the output is a composition of the outputs of subgames through the operators or and and; through round-based combinations; or through intermediate results, which may be themselves computed from other subproblems.
Archer and Tardos [2] studied a scheduling problem where it is NP-Hard to find the optimal output.
As shown in this paper, the MAX and IF-THEN-ELSE  combinations are special cases of the composition-based techniques that we present in this paper for computing the payments in  polynomial time under mild assumptions.
The Internet is a complex distributed system where a multitude of heterogeneous agents cooperate to achieve some common goals, and the existing protocols and  algorithms often assume that all agents will follow the prescribed rules without deviation.
Given any allocation rule O for a binary demand game, we showed that a truthful mechanism M = (O, P) exists for the game if and only if O satisfies a certain monotonicity  property.
In contrast to the VCG mechanisms, we do not require that the allocation should optimize the objective function.
A framework is then proposed in Section 4 to compute the payment P in  polynomial time for several types of allocation rules O.
Towards this end, Nisan and Ronen [14] proposed the framework of algorithmic mechanism design and applied VCG mechanisms to some fundamental problems in computer science, including  shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and scheduling on unrelated machines.
However, in some settings where the agents are selfish instead of altruistic, it is more reasonable to assume these agents are rational - maximize their own profits - according to the neoclassic economics, and new models are needed to cope with the selfish behavior of such agents.
Recall that a mechanism M = (O, P) consists of two parts, an allocation rule O and a  payment scheme P. Previously, it is often assumed that there is an objective function g and an allocation rule O, that either optimizes g exactly or approximately.
The VCG mechanisms [5, 11, 21] are applicable to mechanism design problems whose outputs optimize the  utilitarian objective function, which is simply the sum of all agents"  valuations.
The work of Mu"alem and Nisan [13] is the closest in spirit to our work.
They pointed out that a certain monotonicity property of the output work load is a  necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a truthful  mechanism for their scheduling problem.
In Section 2, we discuss preliminaries and previous works, define binary  demand games and discuss the basic assumptions about binary  demand games.
They provided a family of  deterministic truthful (2 + )-approximation mechanisms for any fixed  number of machines and several (1 + )-truthful mechanisms for some NP-hard restrictions of their scheduling problem.
Some mechanisms other than VCG mechanism are needed to address these issues.
In fact, we do not even require the existence of an  objective function.
They also pointed out that a certain monotonicity in the  allocation rule can lead to a truthful mechanism.
They  characterized all truthful mechanisms based on a certain monotonicity  property in a single-minded auction setting.
[3] studied a similar scheduling problem.
Unfortunately, some objective functions are not utilitarian; even for those problems with a utilitarian objective function,  sometimes it is impossible to find the optimal output in polynomial time unless P=NP.
In Section 5, we provide several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework.
In Section 3, we show that O satisfying a certain monotonicity property is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a truthful mechanism M = (O, P).
They also showed how to used MAX and IF-THEN-ELSE to combine outputs from  subproblems.
[12] studied the single-minded combinatorial auction and gave aâˆš m-approximation truthful mechanism, where m is the number of goods.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
We also assume that the valuations 213 of agents are uncorrelated, i.e., the valuation of an agent only  depends on its own allocation and type.
The monotonicity property only guarantees the existence of a payment scheme P such that (O, P) is truthful.
We conclude our paper in Section 6 with some possible future directions. 
In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, many protocols and algorithms have been proposed to make the Internet more efficient and reliable.
