When ci = κi(O, c−i), Oi(c) can be  either 0 or 1 depending on the tie-breaker of the allocation rule O. Hereafter, we will not consider the tie-breaker scenario in our proofs.
This theorem implies that for the binary demand games we can always normalize the payment to an agent i such that the payment to the agent is 0 when it is not selected.
An output method O is said to satisfy the monotone non-increasing property if for every agent i and two of its possible costs ci1 < ci2 , Oi(c|i ci2 ) ≤ Oi(c|i ci1 ).
For any strategy-proof mechanism for a binary demand game G with setting S, if we fix the cost c−i of all agents other than i, the payment to agent i is a constant p1 i if Oi(c) = 1, and it is another constant p0 i if Oi(c) = 0.
If it does not, then there is no payment scheme P such that mechanism M = (O, P) is truthful.
Fixed the setting S for a binary demand game, if mechanism M = (O, P) satisfies IC, then mechanism M = (O, P ) with the same output method O and pi(c) = pi(c) − δi(c−i) for any function δi(c−i) also satisfies IC.
For binary demand games, this definition implies that if Oi(c|i ci2 ) = 1 then Oi(c|i ci1 ) = 1.
We prove this by constructing a payment scheme and proving that this payment scheme is truthful.
Otherwise, define the payment scheme P as follows.
215 3.2 Existence of Strategyproof Mechanisms Notice, given the setting S, a mechanism design problem is  composed of two parts: the allocation rule O and a payment scheme P. In this paper, given an allocation rule O we focus our attention on how to design a truthful payment scheme based on O.
There exists a value κi(O, c−i)(which we will call a cut value, such that Oi(c) = 1 if ci < κi(O, c−i) and Oi(c) = 0 if ci > κi(O, c−i).
If a mechanism M = (O, P) satisfies IC, then ∀i, if Oi(t|i ti1 ) = Oi(t|i ti2 ), then pi(t|i ti1 ) = pi(t|i ti2 ).
In the following we prove that this payment scheme also satisfies IC property.
Thus, its utility is κi(O, c−i) − ci > 0, which implies that the payment scheme satisfies the IR.
Given an allocation rule O for a binary demand game, we first present a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a truthful payment scheme P. DEFINITION 1 (MONOTONE NON-INCREASING PROPERTY (MP)).
In this case, when i reveals its true valuation, its payment is 0 and the utility is 0.
The allocation rule O satisfies MP.
Since M = (O, P) is truthful, we have p0 i < p1 i − ci2 .
Stage 2: Based on the allocation rule O, find the cut value κi(O, c−i) for agent i such that Oi(c|i di) = 1 when di < κi(O, c−i), and Oi(c|i di) = 0 when di > κi(O, c−i).
To prove this direction, we assume there exists an agent i and two valuation vectors c|i ci1 and c|i ci2 , where ci1 < ci2 , Oi(c|i ci2 ) = 1 and Oi(c|i ci1 ) = 0.
In this case, when i declares its true cost ci, its utility is κi(O, c−i) − ci > 0.
Now consider the scenario when the actual valuation of agent i is ci = ci2 .
Now fix c−i, the utility for i when ci = ci1 is ui(ci1 ) = p0 i .
There exists a truthful payment scheme P for this binary  demand game.
The equivalence of the monotonicity property of the allocation rule O and the existence of a truthful mechanism using O can be extended to games beyond binary demand games.
Hereafter, we will only consider normalized payment schemes.
The payment scheme is: If Oi(c) = 1, then agent i gets payment pi(c) = κi(O, c−i); else it gets payment pi(c) = 0.
Since M = (O, P) is truthful, we have p0 i > p1 i − ci1 .
This inequality implies that ci1 > ci2 , which is a contradiction.
Fix the setting S, c−i in a binary demand game G with the allocation rule O, the following three conditions are equivalent: 1.
Stage 3: The payment for agent i is 0 if Oi(c) = 0; the payment is κi(O, c−i) if Oi(c) = 1.
Case 2: ci ≥ κ(O, c−i).
Now consider the situation when i declares a valuation di = ci.
The payment defined by our general framework is minimum among all truthful payment schemes using O as output. 
When agent i lies its valuation to ci2 , its utility is p1 i − ci1 .
3.1 Properties of Strategyproof Mechanisms We discuss several properties that mechanisms need to satisfy in order to be truthful.
If di > κi(O, c−i), then i gets the same payment and utility since it is still not selected.
Now consider the  situation when i declares a cost di = ci.
General Framework 1 Truthful mechanism design for a binary demand game Stage 1: Check whether the allocation rule O satisfies MP.
Case 1: ci < κ(O, c−i).
From corollary 2, we know that pi(c|i ci1 ) = p0 i and pi(c|i ci2 ) = p1 i .
If di < κi(O, c−i), then i gets the same payment and utility since it is still selected.
Similarly, if it lies its valuation to ci1 , its utility is p0 i .
Its utility is p1 i − ci2 when it reports its true valuation.
We then show Condition 1 implies Condition 3.
This definition is not restricted only to binary demand games.
If di ≤ κi(O, c−i), then its utility becomes κi(O, c−i) − ci ≤ 0 since it is selected now.
We now summarize the process to design a truthful payment scheme for a binary demand game based on an output method O.
The proof that Condition 2 implies Condition is  straightforward and is omitted here.
If di > κi(O, c−i), then its utility becomes 0 since it is not selected anymore.
We then show Condition 3 implies Condition 2.
From condition 1, if Oi(c) = 1 then ci > κi(O, c−i).
The proofs of above theorems are straightforward and thus  omitted due to space limit.
Consequently, we have p1 i −ci2 > p0 i > p1 i −ci1 .
Thus, it has no incentive to lie in this case.
THEOREM 1.
The proof of this is similar to a proof in [13].
Thus, it has no incentive to lie.
COROLLARY 2.
THEOREM 3.
THEOREM 5.
There are two cases here.
THEOREM 4.
The details are omitted here due to space limit.
