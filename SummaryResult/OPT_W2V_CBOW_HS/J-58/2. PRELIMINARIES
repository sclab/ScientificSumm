In addition, the binary demand game studied here is different from the traditional packing IP"s: we only require that the allocation to each agent is binary and the  allocation rule satisfies a certain monotonicity property; we do not put any restrictions on the objective function.
Thus, throughout his paper, we only consider these direct-revelation mechanisms in which every agent only needs to reveal its valuation vi = v(ti, 1).
The allocation rule O studied here does not necessarily  optimize an objective function, while a VCG mechanism only uses the output that optimizes the objective function.
Throughout this paper, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, the setting S of the game is fixed and we are only interested in how to design P for a given allocation rule O.
For example, the type ti can be the cost that agent i incurs for forwarding a packet in a network or can be a payment that the agent is willing to pay for a good in an auction.
The VCG  mechanism applies to (affine) maximization problems where the  objective function is utilitarian g(o, t) = P i v(ti, o) (i.e., the sum of all agents" valuations) and the set of possible outputs is assumed to be finite.
A direct-revelation mechanism is a mechanism in which the only actions available to each agent are to report its private type either truthfully or falsely to the mechanism.
Archer and Tardos characterized that all truthful mechanism should have decreasing work curves w and that the truthful payment should be Pi(bi) = Pi(0) + biwi(bi) − R bi 0 wi(u)du Using this model, Archer and Tardos  designed truthful mechanisms for several scheduling related  problems, including minimizing the span, maximizing flow and  minimizing the weighted sum of completion time problems.
The main differences between the binary demand games and those problems that can be solved by VCG mechanisms are: 1.
Here, following a common assumption in the literature, we assume the utility for agent i is quasi-linear, i.e., ui(ti, o) = v(ti, o) + Pi(a).
For an allocation rule satisfying (1) exactness: the set of goods allocated to an agent i is either Si or ∅; (2) monotonicity: proposing more money for fewer goods  cannot cause a bidder to lose its bid, they proposed a truthful payment scheme as follows: (1) charge a winning bidder a certain amount that does not depend on its own bidding; (2) charge a losing  bidder 0.
gave a greedy round-based allocation algorithm, based on the rank ai |Si|1/2 , that has an approximation ratio √ m, where m is the  number of goods in S. Based on the approximation algorithm, they gave a truthful payment scheme.
An action ai is called dominant for i if it (weakly) maximizes the utility of i for all possible strategies b−i of other agents, i.e., ui(ti, O(b−i, ai)) ≥ ui(ti, O(b−i, ai)) for all ai = ai and b−i.
A direct revelation mechanism M = (O(t), P(t)) belongs to the VCG family if (1) the allocation O(t) maximizesP i v(ti, o), and (2) the payment to agent i is pi(t) = P j=i vj(tj, O(t))+ hi (t−i), where hi () is an arbitrary function of t−i.
Then, in a direct-revelation mechanism satisfying IC, the  payment scheme should satisfy the property that, for each agent i, v(ti, O(t)) + pi(t) ≥ v(ti, O(t|i ti)) + pi(t|i ti).
Examples of binary demand games include: unicast [14, 22, 9] and multicast [23, 24, 8] (generally subgraph  construction by selecting some links/nodes to satisfy some property),  facility location [7], and a certain auction [12, 2, 13].
Let a|i ai = (a1, · · · , ai−1, ai, ai+1, · · · , an), i.e., each agent j = i plays an action aj except that the agent i plays ai.
Furthermore, the main focus of this paper is to design some general techniques to find the truthful payment scheme for a given allocation rule O satisfying a certain monotonicity property. 
In a binary demand game, if we want to optimize an  objective function g(o, t), then we call it a binary optimization demand game.
In [2], Archer and Tardos showed how to design truthful  mechanisms for several combinatorial problems where each agent"s  private information is naturally expressed by a single positive real number, which will always be the cost incurred per unit load.
An incentive compatible (IC) mechanism is a direct-revelation mechanism in which if an agent reports its type ti truthfully, then it will maximize its  utility.
In [12], it is assumed that the set of goods allocated to an agent i is either Si or ∅, which is known as exactness.
Everything about a game S, M ,  including the setting S, the allocation rule O and the payment scheme P, is public knowledge except the agent i"s actual type ti, which is private information to agent i.
All of their methods required the welfare function associated with the output satisfying bitonic property.
We assume that the agents" valuations are not correlated in a binary demand game, while the agents" valuations may be correlated in a VCG mechanism.
Here the payment pi(·) is the money given to agent i and depends on the strategies used by the agents.
They devised a randomized  rounding method that is incentive compatible and gave a truthful  mechanism for combinatorial auctions with single parameter agents that approximately maximizes the social value of the auction.
Another  common requirement in the literature for mechanism design is so called individual rationality or voluntary participation: the agent"s utility of participating in the output of the mechanism is not less than the utility of the agent of not participating.
Notice the assumption of exactness reveals that the single minded auction is indeed a binary demand game.
A valuation function v(ti, o) assigns a monetary amount to agent i for each possible output o.
The allocation rule of a VCG mechanism is required to  maximize the objective function in the range of the allocation function.
But notice that their proof is heavily based on the assumption that the output is a continuous function of the cost, thus their conclusion can"t directly apply to binary demand games.
Let a−i = (a1, · · · , ai−1, ai+1, · · · , an) denote the actions of all agents  except i.
All our results can apply to the case where the agents receive the service rather than provide by setting ci to negative, as in auction.
2.1 Mechanism Design As usually done in the literatures about the designing of  algorithms or protocols with inputs from individual agents, we adopt the assumption in neoclassic economics that all agents are rational, i.e., they respond to well-defined incentives and will deviate from the protocol only if the deviation improves their gain.
Under mild  assumptions, VCG mechanisms are the only truthful implementations for utilitarian problems [10].
Let ui(ti, o) denote the utility of agent i at the outcome of the game o, given its preferences ti.
The objective function is utilitarian (or affine maximization problem) for a problem solvable by VCG while there is no  restriction on the objective function for a binary demand game.
They proved that all truthful mechanisms should have a monotonicity output and their payment scheme is based on the cut value.
For the convenience of  presentation, we define the cost of agent as ci = −v(ti, 1), i.e., it costs agent i ci to provide the service.
Theorem 4 also depends on the  monotonicity property, but it is applicable to a broader setting than the  single minded combinatorial auction.
, an) where agent i plays strategy ai ∈ Ai, the mechanism M = (O, P) computes an output o = O(a) and a payment vector p(a) = (p1(a), .
In this paper, we assume for technical convenience that the  objective function g(o, c), if exists, is continuous with respect to the cost ci, but most of our results are directly applicable to the discrete case without any modification.
In this paper, we study how to design a truthful mechanism that does not optimize a utilitarian objective function.
The valuation v(ti, oi) is a publicly known value and is  normalized to 0.
Notice when the load of the problems is w = {0, 1}, it is indeed a binary demand game.
The valuation of the agents are not correlated, i.e., v(ti, o) is a function of v(ti, oi) only is denoted as v(ti, oi).
Distinction between our contributions and previous results: It has been shown in [2, 6, 12, 13] that for the single minded combinatorial auction, there exists a payment scheme which  results in a truthful mechanism if the allocation rule satisfies a certain monotonicity property.
A game is defined as G = (S, M), where S is the setting for the game G. Here, S consists the parameters of the game that are set before the game starts and do not depend on the players" strategies.
The mechanism"s output could be arbitrary real number but their  valuation is a quasi-linear function t · w, where t is the private per unit cost and w is the work load.
They clearly stated that we only discussed a limited class of bidders, single minded bidders, that was introduced by [12].
On the contrary, in this paper, we study how to design a deterministic mechanism that is truthful based on some given allocation rules.
Each agent i has a set of strategies Ai from which it can choose.
2.2 Binary Demand Games A binary demand game is a game G = (S, M), where M = (O, P) and the range of O is {0, 1}n .
We even do not require the existence of an objective function.
Furthermore, replacing an optimal algorithm for  computing the output with an approximation algorithm usually leads to untruthful mechanisms if a VCG payment scheme is used.
, n and each agent i has some private  information ti, called its type, only known to itself.
In a  singleminded combinatorial auction, each agent i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) only wants to buy a subset Si ⊆ S with private price ci.
If we apply their characterization of the truthful mechanism, their decreasing work curves w implies exactly the monotonicity property of the output.
With a simple generalization, we get our conclusion for general binary demand game.
As they pointed out, their method is strongly truthful in sense that it is  truthful with high probability 1 − , where is an error probability.
A direct-revelation  mechanism is strategproof if it satisfies both IC and IR properties.
214 Notice that in applications where agents providing service and receiving payment, e.g., unicast and job scheduling, the valuation vi of an agent i is usually negative.
This makes the mechanism computationally intractable in many cases.
A single-minded  bidder i declares a bid bi = Si, ai with Si ⊆ S and ai ∈ R+ .
Their payment scheme inspired our payment scheme for binary demand game.
[12] studied how to design an efficient truthful mechanism for single-minded combinatorial auction.
studied the combinatorial auctions where multiple copies of many different items are on sale, and each  bidder i desires only one subset Si.
A standard model for mechanism design is as follows.
Arguably the most important positive result in mechanism  design is the generalized Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism by Vickrey [21], Clarke [5], and Groves [11].
, On(t)), where Oi(t) = 1 (respectively, 0) means that agent i is (respectively, is not) selected.
Throughout this paper, we will use ci instead of vi in our analysis.
This assumption is needed to guarantee the IR property.
The paper of Ahuva Mu"alem and Noam Nisan [13] is closest in spirit to our work.
Hereafter, we make the following further assumptions.
For example, in a unicast routing game [14], the setting consists of the topology of the network, the source node and the destination node.
For each input vector a = (a1, .
The agents" types define the type  vector t = (t1, t2, .
There are n agents 1, .
Sometimes, we write (a−i, bi) as a|i bi.
In other words, the  output is a n-tuple vector O(t) = (O1(t), O2(t), .
, pn(a)).
They proposed several combination methods including MAX, IF-THEN-ELSE construction to perform partial search.
