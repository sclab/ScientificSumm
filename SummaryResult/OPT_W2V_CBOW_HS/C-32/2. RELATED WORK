In contrast, BuddyCache uses application level multicast and a sender-reliable  coherence protocol to provide similar access latency  improvements for transactional objects.
Multiprocessor systems and distributed shared memory systems [14, 4, 17, 18, 5] use fine-grain coherence techniques to avoid the performance penalty of false sharing but do not address issues of availability when nodes fail.
[11, 15])  investigate issues of maintaining a directory of objects cached in nearby proxy caches in wide-area environment, using  distributed directory protocols for tracking cache changes.
BuddyCache provides similar bandwidth improvements when objects are available in the group cache. 
These techniques use the server to provide redirection and do not consider issues of high network  latency.
Cooperative caching techniques [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] provide access to client caches to avoid high disk access latency in an environment where servers and clients run on a fast local area network.
last-writer-wins policy for broadcast applications, to deal with concurrent updates but is limited to file systems.
The schema supports small multi-sender groups appropriate for collaborative  applications and considers coherence issues in the presence of  failures but does not support strong consistency or fine-grained sharing.
Mazieres studies a bandwidth saving technique [24] to  detect and avoid repeated file fragment transfers across a WAN when fragments are available in a local cache.
This work does not consider issues of consistent concurrent  updates to shared fine-grained objects.
Cheriton and Li propose MMO [12] a hybrid web  coherence protocol that combines invalidations with updates using multicast delivery channels and receiver-reliable  protocol, exploiting locality in a way similar to BuddyCache.
This multicast transport level solution is geared to the single writer semantics of web objects.
The protocol uses leases to provide fault-tolerant call-backs and takes  advantage of nearby caches to reduce the cost of lease extensions.
Cooperative Web caching techniques, (e.g.
Anderson, Eastham and Vahdat in WebFS [29] present a global file system coherence protocol that allows clients to choose 27 on per file basis between receiving updates or invalidations.
Yin, Alvisi, Dahlin and Lin [32, 31] present a  hierarchical WAN cache coherence scheme.
In contrast, our work uses implementation and analysis to evaluate the costs and benefits of redirection and fine grained updates in an optimistic system.
Application level multicast solution in a middle-ware system was described by  Pendarakis, Shi and Verma in [27].
The study uses simulation to investigate latency and fault tolerance issues in hierarchical avoidance-based coherence scheme.
The  protocol exploits application specific methods e.g.
Updates and invalidations are multicast on separate  channels and clients subscribe to one of the channels.
