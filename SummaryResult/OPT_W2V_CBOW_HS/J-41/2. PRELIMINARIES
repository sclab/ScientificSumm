Introducing this element into the model is an important next step for future work.10 2.2 Auction Formats In a slot auction a bidder provides to the seller a declared value per click ˜xi(xi, αi) which depends on his true value and relevance.
That is, the expected utility to bidder i of obtaining the slot of rank j at a price of b per click is ui(j, b) = γjαi(xi − b) If the advertising firms bidding in the slot auction are  riskneutral and have ample liquidity, quasi-linearity is a  reasonable assumption.
This is consistent with the practice in real slot auctions where ties are broken by the bidders" order of arrival. 
Hence bidder i"s advertisement will have a clickthrough rate of γjαi if placed in slot j.
If k = N, bidder σ(k) pays 0 per click.11 Intuitively, a second-price payment rule sets a bidder"s  payment to the lowest bid it could have declared while  maintaining the same ranking, given the allocation rule used.
The assumption that clickthrough rate decays monotonically with lower slots-by the same factors for each agent-is unique to the slot auction  problem.
Note that no matter what the payment rule, a bidder that is not allocated a slot will pay 0 since his listing cannot receive any clicks.
We consider two types of allocation rules, rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR): 10 Models with budget constraints have begun to appear in this research area.
Bidder i assigns a value of Xi to each click received on its advertisement, regardless of this advertisement"s rank.9 The probability that i"s advertisement will be clicked if viewed is Ai ∈ [0, 1].
Since a bidder"s relevance αi is observable to the seller, the bidder cannot misrepresent it.
Each bidder"s value and relevance pair (Xi, Ai) is  independently and identically distributed on [0, ¯x] × [0, 1] according to a continuous density function f that has full support on its domain.
The Xi, Ai, and Ri are random 9 Indeed Kitts et al.
2.1 The Model There is a fixed number K of slots to be allocated among N bidders.
[3] design multi-unit auctions for budget-constrained bidders, which can be interpreted as slot auctions, with a focus on revenue optimization and truthfulness.
With budget constraints keyword auctions cannot be considered independently of one another, because the budget must be allocated across  multiple keywords-a single advertiser typically bids on multiple keywords relevant to his business.
The bidder allocated slot k, namely σ(k), pays ˜xσ(k) per click under both the RBB and RBR  allocation rules.
We denote the kth highest of the N declared values by ˜x(k) , and the kth highest of the N declared revenues by ˜r(k) , where the declared revenue of bidder i is ˜ri = αi ˜xi.
Google then followed in 2000 with a second-price RBR scheme.
However, for the purposes of our model it is also important that bidders believe that conversion rate does not vary with rank.
There is a permutation of the agents κ : [N] → [N] that is fixed beforehand.
We often denote this declared value (bid) by ˜xi for short.
Both bidder i and the seller know the realization αi of Ai, but this realization remains unobservable to the other bidders.
Of course, an advertisement does not receive any clicks if it is not allocated a slot.
Our model lacks budget constraints, which are an  important feature of real slot auctions.
We focus on a slot auction for a single keyword.
[7] state that their actual clickthrough data is fitted extremely well by an exponential decay model with δ = 1.428.
The probability that an advertisement will be viewed if placed in slot j is γj ∈ [0, 1].
In a setting of incomplete information, a bidder knows only  distributions over others" private information (value per click and relevance).
We will commonly represent an allocation by a one-to-one function σ : [K] → [N], where [n] is the set of integers {1, 2, .
We assume that ties are broken as follows in the event that two agents make the exact same bid or declare the same revenue.
We first describe the model for the case with incomplete information, and drop the  distributional information from the model when we come to the complete-information case in Section 4.
We assume that bidders have quasi-linear utility  functions.
We view it as a main contribution of our work to show that this assumption allows for tractable analysis of the slot auction problem using standard tools from  singleitem auction theory.
If the bids of agents i and j are tied, then agent i obtains a higher slot if and only if κ(i) < κ(j).
We refer to Ri = AiXi as bidder i"s revenue.
If k < N, bidder σ(k) pays ˜xσ(k+1) per click under the RBB rule, and pays ˜rσ(k+1)/ασ(k) per click under the RBR rule.
Overture introduced the first slot auction design in 1997, using a first-price RBB scheme.
, γK are common knowledge.
With complete information, a bidder knows others" private information, and so does not need to rely on distributions to strategize.
A common model of  decaying clickthrough rate is the exponential decay model, where γk = 1 δk−1 with decay δ > 1.
Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜ri = ˜r(k) .
The assumptions of independence, symmetry, and  riskneutrality made above are all quite standard in single-item auction theory [11, 19].
Only bidder i knows the  realization xi of its value per click Xi.
Hence slot k goes to bidder σ(k).
[10] find that in their sample of actual click data, the correlation between rank and conversion rate is not statistically significant.
We refer to Ai as bidder i"s relevance.
Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜xi = ˜x(k) .
We assume without loss of generality that K ≤ N, since superfluous slots can remain blank.
In 2002, Overture (at this point acquired by Yahoo!)
We also consider two different types of payment rules.
One possible reason for the switch is given in Section 4.
[14] address the problem of matching user queries to budget-constrained advertisers so as to maximize revenue.
then switched to second pricing but still allocates using RBB.
