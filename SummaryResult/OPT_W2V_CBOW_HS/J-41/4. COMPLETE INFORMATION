Since xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for i > j, the system of inequalities in Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the allocation is the result of some Nash equilibrium bid profile.
Since this holds for any two consecutive bidders, it follows that in a Nash equilibrium all bidders must be bidding 0 (since the bidder ranked last matches the bid directly below him, which is 0 by default because there is no such bid).
The next two lemmas give conditions that characterize the allocations that can occur as a result of an equilibrium profile of bids, given fixed agent values and revenues.
For instance, according to Lemma 2, with two agents and two slots any allocation can arise in a RBR equilibrium because no  constraints apply.
Finally, the agent in slot i + 1 sees no change in the price of any slot, so his slot remains most preferred.
Note that we cannot have bi > bi+1, or else the agent in slot i can make a profitable deviation by instead bidding bi − > bi+1 for small enough > 0.
In the first case we have σ(i) = i + 1.
We first argue that  constraints (6) can be removed, because the inequalities above can be satisfied if and only if the inequalities without (6) can be satisfied.
Note that for RBR, the standard value is also the  efficient value by Theorem 1.
For an allocation σ that results from a  purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBB slot  auction, we have g(σ) ≥ Lg(ηx).
For the remainder of the paper, we assume that there are as many slots as bidders.
Let σ : [K] → [N] be the allocation of slots to the agents resulting from their bids.
16 We do not claim that bidders will actually learn each  others" private information (value and relevance), just that for a stable set of bids there is a corresponding equilibrium of the complete information game.
With δ = 1.428 (see  Section 2.1), the factor is L ≈ 1/3.34, so the total value in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot auction is always within a factor of 3.34 of the efficient value with such a discount.
Given an allocation σ, there exists a Nash  equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBB slot auction if and only if „ 1 − γi γj+1 « xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2.
An agent in slot k < i sees the price of slot i decrease from bi+1 to bi+1 = bi, but this does not make i more preferred than k to this agent because we have πk ≥ γi−1(rσ(k) − bi) ≥ γi(rσ(k) − bi) = γi(rσ(k) −bi+1) (i.e.
We denote by g(σ) = PN i=1 γixσ(i) allocation σ"s value when assuming all agents have identical relevance, normalized to 1.
To prove the theorem, we will make repeated use of the fact thatP k akP k bk ≥ mink ak bk when the ak and bk are positive.
Now if we wish to raise zσ(i)j above 0 by one unit for j = i, we must lower zσ(i)i by one unit because of the constraint of type (8).
There exists a desired vector b which constitutes a Nash equilibrium if and only if the following set of  inequalities can be satisfied (the variables are the πi and bj): πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj) ∀i, ∀j < i (3) πi ≥ γj(rσ(i) − bj+1) ∀i, ∀j > i (4) πi = γi(rσ(i) − bi+1) ∀i (5) bi ≥ bi+1 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 (6) πi ≥ 0, bi ≥ 0 ∀i Here rσ(i) is the revenue of the agent allocated slot i, and πi and bi may be interpreted as this agent"s surplus and declared revenue, respectively.
Hence if the following inequalities hold: rσ(i) ≤ „ γi γj « rσ(i) + rσ(j−1) (9) for 2 ≤ j ≤ N − 1 and i > j, raising some zσ(i)j with i > j cannot make the objective positive, and there is no z that satisfies all inequalities above.
By the Farkas lemma, the remaining inequalities can be satisfied if and only if there is no vector z such that X i,j (γj rσ(i)) zσ(i)j > 0 X i>j γjzσ(i)j + X i<j γj−1zσ(i)j−1 ≤ 0 ∀j (7) X j zσ(i)j ≤ 0 ∀i (8) zσ(i)j ≥ 0 ∀i, ∀j = i zσ(i)i free ∀i Note that a variable of the form zσ(i)i appears at most once in a constraint of type (8), so such a variable can never be positive.
Because γjrσ(i) ≤ γirσ(i) for i < j, raising 224 zσ(i)j with i < j while adjusting other variables to maintain feasibility cannot make the objective P i,j(γjrσ(i))zσ(i)j  positive.
Thus, γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri + γirσ(i) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi , 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ff If slot i is not inverted, then on one hand we may have σ(i) ≤ i, in which case rσ(i)/ri ≥ 1.
By our arguments above two consecutive slots cannot be inverted, so we can write f(σ) f(γr) = P i∈I ` γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) ´ + P i∈I γirσ(i) P i∈I (γiri + γi+1ri+1) + P i∈I γiri ≥ min  min i∈I  γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ff , min i∈I  γirσ(i) γiri ffff ≥ L and this completes the proof.
Then by Lemma 2, rσ(i) ≥ rj  1 − γi+2 γi+1  ≥ ri  1 − γi+2 γi+1  .
Then γirσ(i) + γi+1rσ(i+1) γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ γi+1ri + γiri+1 γiri + γi+1ri+1 ≥ min  γi+1 γi , γi γi+1 ff = γi+1 γi In the second case we have σ(i) > i+1.
The following result shows that there can be no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with first pricing.17 Note that the argument holds for both RBB and RBR allocation rules.
By the same type of argument but appealing to Lemma 2 for RBR, there exists a Nash equilibrium bid profile such that bidders are ranked according to their true revenues.
There exists no complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the first-price slot auction, for any possible values of the agents, whether using a RBB or RBR allocation rule.
Then since all agents in S except the one in slot i lie strictly below slot i + 1, and 225 the agent in slot i is not agent i + 1, it must be that agent i+1 is in a slot strictly below slot i+1.
Assume we have a vector (π, b) which satisfies all inequalities above except (6).
With first pricing, there will always be some bidder that feels compelled to adjust his bid.
This bidder can obtain the top spot and increase his revenue by (γ1 −γK)rK > 0 by bidding some > 0, and for small enough this is necessarily a profitable deviation.
We brush over such issues by assuming that an agent can bid infinitesimally higher than another.
It may be the case that for some slot i, we have σ(i) > i and for slots k > i + 1 we have σ(k) > i.
If the process  stabilizes the result can then be modeled as a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of the static one-shot game of complete  information, since each bidder will be playing a best-response to the others" bids.16 This argument seems especially  appropriate for Yahoo!
Conversely, if some inequality (9) does not hold, the objective can be made  positive by raising the corresponding zσ(i)j and adjusting other variables so that feasibility is just maintained.
But this is impossible: consider the bidder ranked last.
That is, if ri > rj then with RBR agent j can be ranked higher than i only if the ratio rj/ri is sufficiently large; similarly for RBB.
For an allocation σ of slots to agents, we denote its  total value by f(σ) = PN i=1 γirσ(i).
Given an allocation σ, there exists a Nash  equilibrium profile of bids b leading to σ in a second-price RBR slot auction if and only if „ 1 − γi γj+1 « rσ(i) ≤ rσ(j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N − 2 and i ≥ j + 2.
Also, zσ(i)1 = 0 for all i = 1 by constraint (7), since such variables never appear with another of the form zσ(i)i.
[7] find through their simulations that with a  bivariate normal distribution over value-relevance pairs, and with 5 slots, 15 bidders, and δ = 2, RBR dominates RBB in terms of revenue for any level of correlation between value and relevance.
The desired Nash equilibrium exists if and only if a related set of inequalities can be satisfied; by the Farkas lemma, this occurs if and only if an alternate set of inequalities cannot be satisfied.
For an allocation σ that results from a  purestrategy Nash equilibrium of a second-price RBR slot  auction, we have f(σ) ≥ Lf(ηr).
If slot i is inverted, it is occupied by some agent from S. Also all slots strictly lower than i + 1 must be occupied by the remaining agents from S, since σ(k) > i for k ≥ i + 2.
The agent in slot i sees the price of this slot go down, which only makes it more preferred.
Then there is some i for which bi < bi+1.
The identity of this bidder is always clear given the deterministic tie-breaking rule.
According to Lemmas 2 and 3, a ranking that results from a Nash equilibrium profile can only deviate from the standard  allocation by having agents with relatively similar values or revenues switch places.
because the agent in slot k did not  originally prefer slot i − 1 at price bi, he will not prefer slot i at price bi).
By Theorem 1, this latter allocation is efficient.
We number the agents so that agent i has the ith highest revenue, so r1 ≥ r2 ≥ .
Indeed we expect that in many cases there will be multiple allocations (and hence equilibria) which satisfy the  conditions of Lemmas 2 and 3.
Google keeps bids private, but  experimentation can allow one to discover other bids, especially since second pricing automatically reveals to an agent the bid of the agent ranked directly below him.
We then recursively apply the change until we eventually obtain a vector that satisfies all inequalities.
This means that it is at least two slots below the agent that actually occupies slot i, and by Lemma 2 we then have rσ(i) ≥ ri+1  1 − γi+2 γi+1  .
If this objective is positive, then this is due to some component zσ(i)j with i > j being positive.
Simply substitute bidder values for bidder revenues in the proof of Theorem 4, and appeal to Lemma 3. 
There always exists an efficient complete  information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the  secondprice RBR slot auction.
However, they assume that bidding behavior in a second-price slot auction can be well approximated by truthful bidding.
Let ri and bi be the revenue and bid of the agent ranked ith , respectively.
A similar argument applies for agents in slots k > i + 1.
Now for the constraints of type (7), if i > j then zσ(i)j appears with zσ(j−1)j−1 (for 1 < j < N).
The agent in slot i + 1 must then have an index σ(i + 1) ≤ i (note this means slot i + 1 cannot be inverted).
This suggests that the value of an equilibrium allocation cannot differ too much from the value obtained in the standard allocation, and the following theorems confirms this.
We then say that slot i is inverted.
Second pricing is more convenient because an equilibrium can be reached, and this reduces the cost of bid management.
4.1 Equilibrium Analysis In this section we ask whether a pure-strategy Nash  equilibrium exists in a RBB or RBR slot auction, with either first or second pricing.
4.2 Efficiency For a given allocation rule, we call the allocation that would result if the bidders reported their values truthfully the standard allocation.
Again for RBB we have an analogous result.
[2] have proven this result in a model with three bidders and three slots, and we generalize their  argument.
On the other hand, we find that in a second-price slot  auction there can be a multitude of pure strategy Nash  equilibria.
and Google, bidders can adjust their bids up or down at any time.
Let S be the set of agents with indices at least i + 1; there are N − i of these.
On the other hand we may have σ(i) > i but there is some agent with index j ≤ i that lies at least two slots below slot i.
The proof technique is the same as in the previous lemma.
We first make this change to the bi+1 where bi < bi+1 and index i is smallest.
Hence in the standard RBB  allocation bidders are ranked by true values, and in the standard RBR allocation they are ranked by true revenues.
In our model we allow bids to be  nonnegative real numbers for mathematical convenience, but this can become problematic because there is then no bid that is just higher than another.
So to raise the former variable γ−1 j units and maintain feasibility, we must (I) lower zσ(i)i by γ−1 j units, and (II) lower zσ(j−1)j−1 by γ−1 j−1 units.
"s slot auction design where all bids are 14 To be entirely rigorous and consistent with our initial  assumptions, we should have constructed a continuous  probability density with full support over an appropriate domain.
There always exists a complete information Nash equilibrium in pure strategies in the second-price RBB slot auction.
We safely ignore inequalities (6) from now on.
Hence we must have bi = bi+1 (i.e.
Then if we can exhibit an allocation that satisfies these conditions, there must exist at least one equilibrium.
Note that according to Lemma 2, if agent i lies at least two slots below slot j, then rσ(j) ≥ ri  1 − γj+2 γj+1  .
Let L = min i=1,...,N−1 min  γi+1 γi , 1 − γi+2 γi+1 ff (where by default γN+1 = 0).
In particular, not all equilibria of a second-price RBR auction will be efficient.
The two lemmas above immediately lead to the following result.
The conditions that  determine whether the latter holds are given in the statement of the lemma.
Construct a new vector (π, b ) identical to the original except with bi+1 = bi.
For RBB, bids should be interpreted as declared values, and for RBR as declared revenues.
By a slight reindexing, inequalities (9) yield the statement of the  theorem.
We saw in Section 3.1 that this does not induce truthfulness from bidders.
We now have bi = bi+1.
We first consider the RBR case.
[6] have noted, this can be viewed as a continuous-time process in which bidders learn each other"s bids.
We write i ∈ I if slot i is inverted, and i ∈ I if neither i nor i − 1 are inverted.
In typical slot auctions such as those run by Yahoo!
Hence inequalities (3)-(5) remain valid at (π, b ).
with one bidder bidding infinitesimally higher than the other).
Suppose agents are ranked according to their true values.
Hence there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies.
Let ηx and ηr be the standard allocations when using RBB and RBR, respectively.
This does not change its allocation, but increases its profit.
Now there are two cases.
[0, 1] × [0, 1] and a continuous density with full support that is sufficiently concentrated around (1, 1/2) and (1/2, 1), with roughly equal mass around both, would yield the same conclusion.
The necessary direction is immediate.
Before dealing with the first-price case there is a technical issue involving ties.
This is imprecise but allows us to focus on the intuition behind the result that follows.
They only illustrate the fact with an example because the result is quite immediate.
The RBB case is entirely analogous.
Theorems 2 and 3 taken together provide a possible  explanation for Yahoo!
First consider RBB.
Also note that for an exponential decay model, L = min ˘1 δ , 1 − 1 δ ¯ .
This theorem establishes existence but not uniqueness.
Hence the standard allocation has value f(ηr) = PN i=1 γiri.
