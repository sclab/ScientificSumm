Figure 5(d) provides the time to solution for all the  configurations with VAX (for varying epsilons).
X-axis denotes the approximation parameter, δ  (percentage to optimal) used, while Y-axis denotes the time taken to compute the solution (on a log-scale).
In 3-chain and 4-star configurations, it is  remarkable that both PAX and VAX obtained almost the same actual  quality as the global optimal algorithms, despite the approximation  parameter and δ.
For instance, in the 3-chain case there was a total speedup of 170-fold when the δ was changed from 70 to 30.

For instance, in the  3chain configuration, SPIDER-ABS provides 230-fold speedup over GOA and 2-fold speedup over SPIDER and for the 4-chain  configuration it provides 58-fold speedup over GOA and 2-fold speedup over SPIDER.
We performed two sets of  experiments: (i) firstly, we compared the run-time performance of the above algorithms and (ii) secondly, we experimented with PAX and VAX to study the tradeoff between run-time and solution quality.
Figure 5(a) provides run-time comparisons between the optimal algorithms GOA, SPIDER, SPIDER-Abs and the approximate  algorithms, PAX ( of 30) and VAX(δ of 80).
X-axis denotes the  approximation parameter, used, while Y-axis denotes the time taken to compute the solution (on a log-scale).
For 5-P configuration, the global optimal algorithms did not terminate within the limit of 10000 seconds, so the bar for optimal quality indicates an upper bound on the optimal solution quality.
Figure 5(c) provides the time to solution with PAX (for  varying epsilons).
For instance, in the 4-star case there was a total speedup of 73-fold when the was changed from 60 to 140.
For instance, in the 5-star configuration VAX provides a 15-fold speedup and PAX provides a 8-fold speedup over SPIDER-Abs.
Interestingly, even with a low δ of 30%, the actual solution quality remained equal to the one obtained at 70%.
Figures 5(b) provides a comparison of the solution quality  obtained using the different algorithms for the problems tested in  Figure 5(a).
Since GOA, SPIDER, and SPIDER-Abs are all global optimal algorithms, the solution  quality is the same for all those algorithms.
X-axis denotes the sensor network configuration while Y-axis indicates the solution quality.
X-axis denotes the 1 Machine specs for all experiments: Intel Xeon 3.6 GHZ processor, 2GB RAM sensor network configuration used, while Y-axis indicates the  runtime (on a log-scale).
The time horizon for all the configurations was 4.
For other configurations as well, the loss in quality was less than 20% of the optimal solution quality.
As δ was decreased from 70 to 30, the time to solution decreased drastically.
The time horizon for all the configurations was 4.
With both the  approximations, we obtained a solution quality that was close to the optimal solution quality.
For each configuration (3-chain, 4-chain, 4-star and 5-star), there are five bars indicating the time taken by GOA, SPIDER,  SPIDERAbs, PAX and VAX.
As was increased, the time to solution  decreased drastically.
We compare against GOA because it is the only global optimal algorithm that considers more than two agents.
Algorithms that we experimented with are GOA, SPIDER, SPIDER-ABS, PAX and VAX.
Again, the actual solution quality did not change with varying epsilon.
The time horizon of policy computation was 3.
The two approximation approaches, VAX and PAX provided further improvement in performance over SPIDER-Abs.
GOA did not terminate within the time limit for 4-star and 5-star configurations.
The five network configurations employed are shown in Figure 4.
All our experiments were conducted on the sensor network  domain from Section 2.
SPIDER-Abs dominated the SPIDER and GOA for all the configurations.
Experiments were terminated after 10000 seconds1 .
