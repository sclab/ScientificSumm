This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the database"s strict consistency semantics.
Ganesh is able to use  cryptographic hashes to detect similarity with previous results and send WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 319 compact recipes of results rather than full results.
The growing use of dynamic web content generated from  relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.
Our results also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results to detect similarity is crucial to this performance improvement. 
The essence of the Ganesh architecture is the use of computation at the edges to reduce  communication through the Internet.
Our experimental evaluation confirms that Ganesh, while  conceptually simple, can be highly effective in improving throughput and response time.
Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction are often ineffective for such content.
Our design uses interposition to achieve complete transparency: clients, application servers, and database servers are all unaware of Ganesh"s presence and require no modification.
