It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques.
The metrics of interest are: the localization error (defined as the distance between the computed location and the true location - known from the manual placement), the percentage of nodes correctly  localized, the convergence of the label relaxation algorithm, the time to localize and the robustness of the node ID mapping to errors in the Image Processing module.
Through  simulations of color assignment (not connectivity) we are able to investigate the influence that the size of the coloring space has on the accuracy of localization.
The same trend, of a less accurate localization can be  observed in Figure 21, which shows the percentage of nodes correctly localized (i.e., 0 ft localization error).
The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by  Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment.
Localization error vs. number of colors For this, we fix the number of available colors to either 4, 6 or 8 and vary the number of nodes that are given unique colors, from 0, up to the maximum number of colors (4, 6 or 8).
To estimate the accuracy of our simple model, we plot the number of radio links that exist in the networks, and the number of links that are missing, as functions of the distance between nodes.
In order to investigate the influence the radio connectivity has on localization accuracy, we vary the height above ground of the deployed sensor nodes.
For this evaluation, we ran our localization algorithm with empirical data, but dropped a percentage of nodes from the list of nodes detected by the Image Processing algorithm (we artificially introduced false negatives in the Image  Process0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Number of Colors %CorrectLocalized[x100] Low Connectivity High Connectivity Figure 23.
As seen in the figure if the number of false negatives is 15%, the error in position estimation  doubles when 4 colors are available.
The parameters that we vary in simulations (subsequent to image acquisition and  connectivity collection) the number of colors, the number of  anchors, the number of false positives or negatives as input to the Node ID Matching component, the distance between the imaging device and sensor network (i.e., range),  atmospheric conditions (light attenuation coefficient) and CCR reflectance (indicative of its quality).
The parameters that we vary experimentally are: the  angle under which images are taken, the focus of the camera, and the degree of connectivity.
As shown, for an estimate of 20 ft for the radio range (as  predicted by our Radio Model) we obtain the smallest  localization errors, as small as 2 ft, when enough colors are used.
Percentage of nodes correctly localized We then execute the localization algorithm, which uses the empirical data.
In this section we investigate the effect unique colors have on the localization accuracy.
In this case, the localization algorithm is presented with two sets of nodes of different sizes, that need to be matched: one coming from the Image Processing (which misses some nodes) and one coming from the  network, with the connectivity information (here we assume a fully connected network, so that all sensor nodes report their connectivity information).
It is very probable that the chosen label is incorrect, since the probabilities of some of labels are constantly changing (with each iteration).The convergence of relaxation based algorithms is a well known issue.
The three major research questions that our evaluation tries to answer are: the feasibility of the proposed framework (can sensor nodes be optically detected at large distances), the localization accuracy of one actual implementation of the StarDust framework, and whether or not atmospheric  conditions can affect the recognition of sensor nodes in an  image.
Both the  connectivity constrained and time constrained techniques increase linearly with the network size (for the time constrained, the Central device deploys sensor nodes one by one, recording an image after the time a sensor node is expected to reach the 68 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 Color Connectivity Time Space  ColorConenctivity Color-Time Localization technique Localizationtime[sec] 50 nodes 100 nodes 150 nodes 200 nodes Figure 25.

The apparent radiance Nt r of a target at a  distance r from the light source, is given by: Nt r = Na + Iρte−2σr πr2 (11) where I is the intensity of the light source, ρt is the  target reflectance, σ is the spectral attenuation coefficient (≈ 0.12km−1 and ≈ 0.60km−1 for a clear and a hazy  atmosphere, respectively) and Na is the radiance of the  atmospheric backscatter, and it can be expressed as follows: Na = Gσ2I 2π 2σrZ 0.02σr e−x x2 dx (12) where G = 0.24 is a backscatter gain.
While our light source (3 million candlepower) was  sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million  candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]),  powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet.

The apparent contrast Cr is quantitatively expressed by the formula: Cr = (Nt r −Nb r )/Nb r (10) where Nt r and Nb r are the apparent target radiance and  apparent background radiance at distance r from the light source, respectively.

When the number of colors  becomes relatively large (twelve for our 26 sensor node  network), both scenarios (low and high connectivity) have  comparable localization errors, of less that 2 ft.
Both Figures 17 and 18 confirm our intuition that a larger number of colors available significantly decrease the error in localization.
For each set of pictures the graph shows the number of false positives (the IPA determines that there is a node 65 Figure 13.
As shown, if we increase the number of colors that are uniquely assigned, the percentage of nodes correctly localized decreases.
As shown in Figure 15, the radio range is between 20 ft and 25 ft. For the higher connectivity network, the radio range was between 30 ft and 40 ft. We choose two conservative estimates of the radio range: 20 ft for the low connectivity case and 35 ft for the high  connectivity case, which are in good agreement with the values predicted by our Radio Model.
The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).
Since we are interested in the feasibility of identifying colored sensor nodes at large distance, the end result of our IPA is the 2D location of sensor nodes (position in the image).
Specifically, if 8 colors are available and all are assigned uniquely, the system would be less accurately localized (error ≈ 7 ft), when compared to the case of 6 colors and no unique assignments of colors (≈ 5 ft localization error).
As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is  achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.
The results presented here represent averages over the randomly generated  colorings and over all experimental data sets.
For one experimental data set we generate 50 random assignments of colors to sensor nodes.
If the  algorithm does not converge in a predetermined number of steps, it will terminate and the label with the highest probability will provide the identity of the node.
5.2.1 Radio Model From experiments, we obtain the average number of  observed beacons (k, defined in Section 3.3.2) for the low  connectivity network of 180 beacons and for the high  connectivity network of 420 beacons.
In both scenarios, as expected, localization error decrease with an increase in the number of colors.
5.4 Localization Time In this section we look more closely at the duration for each of the four proposed relaxation techniques and two combinations of them: color-connectivity and color-time.
It is important to observe that, for the evaluation of the Node ID Matching algorithm (color and connectivity constrained), we simulate the color assignment to sensor nodes.
From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.
Two set-ups are used: one in which the sensor nodes are on the ground, and the second one, in which the sensor nodes are raised 3 inches above ground.
5.2.4 Localization Error vs. Connectivity We collected empirical data for two network deployments with different degrees of connectivity (high and low) in  order to assess the influence of connectivity on location  accuracy.
Localization error vs. number of colors proves the localization accuracy quicker, from the additional number of colors available.
The metrics of interest are the number of false positives and false negatives in the Image Processing Algorithm.
One set of pictures obtained as part of our experiment is shown in Figures 10 and 11.

The algorithm is run for three different radio ranges: 15, 20 and 25 ft, to investigate its influence on the localization error.
We assume that 50 unique color filters can be manufactured, that the sensor network is deployed from 2,400 ft  (necessary for the time-constrained relaxation) and that the time required for reporting connectivity grows linearly, with an initial reporting period of 160sec, as used in a real world tracking application [1].
The execution of our IPA  algorithm results in Figure 12 which filters out the background, and Figure 13 which shows the output of the edge detection step of IPA.
From here on, we will refer to these two experimental set-ups as the low connectivity and the high connectivity networks, respectively because when nodes are on the ground the communication range is low resulting in less neighbors than when the nodes are elevated and have a greater communication range.
Image Processing Errors So far we investigated the sources for error in  localization that are intrinsic to the Node ID Matching component.
Also, for a given size of the coloring space (e.g., 6 colors available), if more colors are uniquely assigned to sensor nodes then the localization accuracy decreases.
The  localization duration in this case is identical with the connectivity constrained technique.
Considering our assumptions, only for a network of size 50 the color constrained relaxation works.
In the remaining cases, we obtained a number of false positives of at most one, and a number of false negatives of at most two.
From our Radio Model  (Equation 7, we obtain a radio range R = 25 ft for the low  connectivity network and R = 40 ft for the high connectivity  network.

5.2.2 Localization Error vs. Coloring Space Size In this experiment we investigate the effect of the number of colors on the localization accuracy.
Specifically, we want to experimentally verify our intuition that assigning more nodes to a color can benefit the localization accuracy, by enforcing more constraints, as opposed to uniquely  assigning a color to a single node.
We first investigate the accuracy of our proposed Radio Model, and subsequently use the derived values for the radio range in the evaluation of the Node ID matching component.
It would be very interesting to consider other scenarios, where the strength of the space constrained relaxation (0sec for any sensor network size) is used for improving the other proposed relaxation techniques.
For this, we randomly assign colors from a pool of a given size, to the sensor nodes.
The  localization duration for all other network sizes (100, 150 and 200) is infinite (i.e., unique color assignments to sensor nodes can not be made, since only 50 colors are unique), when only color constrained relaxation is used.

We take 13 sets of pictures using different  orientations of the camera and different zooming factors.
The experimental results are depicted in Figure 20 (localization error) and Figure 21 (percentage of sensor node correctly localized).
In this experiment we investigate how Image Processing errors (false negatives) influence the localization accuracy.
We wanted to evaluate the  performance of the Image Processing Algorithm in a long range, realistic, experimental set-up, while the Node ID Matching required a relatively large area, available for long periods of time (for connectivity data gathering).
Off-line we  investigate the influence of coloring on the metrics of interest, by randomly assigning colors to the sensor nodes.
In this scenario, the set of sensor nodes is split in batches, with each batch  having a set of unique colors.
As expected, the localization accuracy increases with the increase in the number of colors available (larger coloring space).
The number of existing and missing radio  connections in the high connectivity experiment eter ε used in Algorithm 2 was 0.001.
The effect of false negatives on localization accuracy is depicted in Figure 24.
For the evaluation of the Image Processing module, we performed experiments in a football stadium where we  deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3×2 grid.
The same applies to the color constrained relaxation, for which the localization time is 0sec (if the number of colors is  sufficient).
We exclude two pairs of pictures from Figure 14.
By  carefully examining the pictures, we realized that the first pair was taken out of focus and that a car temporarily appeared in one of the pictures of the second pair.
We define the average radio range R to be the distance over which less than 20% of potential radio links, are missing.
The results are depicted in Figure 17 (localization error) and Figure 18 (percentage of nodes correctly localized).
Impact of false negatives on the localization error ing).
Naturally, if we have a maximum number of colors of 4, we can assign at most 4 anchors.
The percentage of successful runs (when the algorithm  converged) is depicted in Figure 19.
Each set is  composed of a picture taken in the dark and of a picture taken with a light beam pointed at the nodes.
All pictures were taken from the same location.
5.5 System Range In this section we evaluate the feasibility of the  StarDust localization framework when considering the realities of light propagation through the atmosphere.
Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the  distance increases).
False Positives and Negatives for the 6 nodes while there is none), and the number of false negatives (the IPA determines that there is no node while there is one).
5.2 Node ID Matching We evaluate the Node ID Matching component of our  system by collecting empirical data (connectivity information) from the outdoor deployment of 26 nodes in the 120×60 ft2 area.
5.2.3 Localization Error vs. Color Uniqueness As mentioned in the Section 3.3.1, a unique color gives a sensor node the statute of an anchor.
As mentioned in Section 4 the size of the coloring space available to us was 5 (5 colors).
For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.
The results obtained from running our localization algorithm are depicted in Figure 22 and Figure 23.
It is interesting to observe that by assigning colors uniquely to nodes, the benefit of  having additional colors is diminished.
As shown, for all practical purposes the time required by the space constrained relaxation techniques is 0sec.

The experimental results are depicted in  Figure 14.
The first two questions are investigated by evaluating the two main components of the StarDust framework: the Image Processing and the Node ID Matching.
As previously presented, luminous objects can be  mistakenly detected to be sensor nodes during the location  detection phase of the Image Processing module.
The localization duration results, as presented in Table 1, are depicted in Figure 25.
In the first excluded pair, we obtain 42 false positives and in the second pair 10 false positives and 7 false negatives.
Figures 26 and 27 depict the apparent contrast Cr as a function of the distance r for a clear and for a hazy  atmosphere, respectively.
The anomaly in the second set was due to the fact that we waited too long to take the second picture.
We collect 20 sets of data for the high connectivity and low connectivity network deployments.
The benefit of having more colors available is still being maintained, at least for the range of colors we investigated (4 through 12 colors).
These false  positives can be eliminated by the color recognition procedure of the Image Processing module.
In this section we present the performance evaluation of a system implementation of the StarDust localization  framework.
The combination of color and time constrained  relaxations is even more interesting.
For the evaluation of the Node ID Mapping component, we deploy 26 sensor nodes in an 120 × 60 ft2 flat area of a stadium.
In about 45% of the cases, we obtained perfect results, i.e., no false positives and no false negatives.
For a reasonable  localization duration of 52seconds a perfect (i.e., 0 ft localization error) localization system can be built.
The results are shown in Figures 15 and 16.
We  varied the number of colors available and assigned no anchors (i.e., no unique assignments of colors).
As shown, in several  situations, the algorithm failed to converge (the algorithm  execution was stopped after 100 iterations per node).
5.1 Image Processing For the IPA evaluation, we deploy 6 sensor nodes in a 3 × 2 grid.
It is interesting to observe that the scenario when more colors are available (e.g., 12  colors) is being affected more drastically than the scenario with less colors (e.g., 4 colors).
The well known fact that relaxation algorithms do not  always converge, was observed during our experiments.
More problematic are false negatives (when a sensor node does not reflect back enough light to be detected).
If the pictures had been taken a few milliseconds apart, the car would have been represented on either both or none of the pictures and the IPA would have filtered it out.
The distance between the Central device and the sensor nodes is approximately 500 ft.
We process the  pictures offline using a Matlab implementation of IPA.
It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.
A sensor node that is an anchor can unequivocally be identified through the Image Processing module.
They need to be handled by the  localization algorithm.
We leave the investigation and rigorous classification of such technique combination for future work.
The apparent contrast is investigated for reflectance coefficients ρt ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 (perfect  reflector).
The performance dramatically  deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.
These  components have been evaluated separately mainly because of lack of adequate facilities.

The third research question is investigated through a computer modeling of  atmospheric phenomena.
The  transformation to 3D coordinates can be done through standard computer graphics techniques [23].
