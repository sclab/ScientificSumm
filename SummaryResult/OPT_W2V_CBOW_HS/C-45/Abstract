We propose and develop localization techniques based on four types of constraints: node color, neighbor information,  deployment time for a node and deployment location for a node.
An image processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes.
We evaluate the performance of a localization system based on our framework by localizing a network of 26  sensor nodes deployed in a 120 Ã— 60 ft2 area.
In the StarDust framework, sensor nodes are equipped with optical retro-reflectors.
The problem of localization in wireless sensor networks where nodes do not use ranging hardware, remains a  challenging problem, when considering the required location  accuracy, energy expenditure and the duration of the  localization phase.
In this paper we propose a framework, called StarDust, for wireless sensor network localization based on passive optical components.
For matching a node ID to a location we propose a constraint-based label relaxation algorithm.
An aerial device projects light towards the deployed sensor  network, and records an image of the reflected light.

The localization accuracy ranges from 2 ft to 5 ft while the localization time ranges from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes.
