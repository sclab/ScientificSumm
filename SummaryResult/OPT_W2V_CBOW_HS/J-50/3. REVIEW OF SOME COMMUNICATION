For the purposes of this paper, we will consider a nondeterministic protocol correct if for every input vector, there is some  sequence of nondeterministic choices the players can make so that the players know the value of f when the protocol  terminates.
Therefore, technically, we do not prove the lower bound for (number of candidates, number of voters) pairs (m, n) that do not satisfy these assumptions (for  example, if we make the above assumption, then we technically do not prove the lower bound for any pair (m, n) in which n is even).
To simplify the proofs of our lower bounds, we make  assumptions such as the number of voters n is odd in many of these proofs.
This will strengthen our lower bound results (because it implies that even finding out whether one given candidate wins is hard).5 Thus, a fooling set in our  context is a set of vectors of votes so that a wins (does not win) with each of them; but for any two different vote vectors in the set, there is a way of taking some voters" votes from the first vector and the others" votes from the second vector, so that a does not win (wins).
80 For the purposes of this paper, f is the voting rule that maps the votes to the winning candidate, and xi is voter i"s vote (the information that the voting rule would require from the voter if there were no possibility of multistage communication-i.e.
Each player 1 ≤ i ≤ n knows (only) input xi.
Nevertheless, we always prove the lower bound for a representative set of (m, n) pairs.
In a deterministic protocol for computing f, in each stage, one of the players announces (to all other players) a bit of information based on her own input and the bits announced so far.
A fooling set is a set of input vectors {(x1 1, x1 2, .
For example, for  every one of our lower bounds it is the case that for infinitely many values of m, there are infinitely many values of n such that the lower bound is proved for the pair (m, n). 
Eventually, the communication terminates and all players know f(x1, x2, .
It is known that if a fooling set of size k exists, then log k is a lower bound on the communication complexity (even the nondeterministic communication complexity) [12].
(That is, we can mix the inputs from the two input vectors to obtain a vector with a different function value.)
However, when we derive our lower bounds, f will only signify whether a  distinguished candidate a wins.
The nondeterministic communication complexity of a problem is the worst-case number of bits sent in the best (correct) nondeterministic protocol for it.
, xi n) = f0 for some constant f0, but for any i = j, there exists some vector (r1, r2, .
The  deterministic communication complexity of a problem is the  worstcase number of bits sent in the best (correct) deterministic protocol for it.
The goal is to minimize the worst-case (over all input vectors) number of bits sent.

We are now ready to give the definition of a fooling set.
In a nondeterministic protocol, the next bit to be sent can be chosen nondeterministically.
(That is, f is 1 if a wins, and 0 otherwise.)

COMPLEXITY THEORY In this section, we review the basic model of a  communication problem and the lower-bounding technique of  constructing a fooling set.
