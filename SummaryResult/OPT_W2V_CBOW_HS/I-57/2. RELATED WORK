They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.
These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.
Moreover, they  provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an  approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient  statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.
They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always  truthfully report their trust estimates.
The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers.
He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.
Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple  variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.
Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].
However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta  distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agent"s belief over multiple dimensions. 
They  provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.
In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).
We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must  estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.
However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.
use the beta distribution to describe an agent"s belief in the probability that another agent will  successfully fulfill its commitments [11].
Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.
By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more  principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.
Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated  confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.
Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.
take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5].
Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.
The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.
They define  multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a supplier"s estimated behaviour.
In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic  meaning.
Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and  quality [4].
Likewise, Teacy et al.
