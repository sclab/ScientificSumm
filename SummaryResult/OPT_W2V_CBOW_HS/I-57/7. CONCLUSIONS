Our starting point was an agent  estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet  distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent.
In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated dimensions.
We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate  reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems.
Our future work in this area is to extend the exchange of  reputation to the case where contracts are not homogeneous.
addressing this challenge, we hope to be able to apply these  techniques to a setting in which a suppliers provides a range of services whose failures are correlated, and agents only have direct  experiences of different subsets of these services. 
This is a challenging extension, since in this case, the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution can not be used directly.
That is, not all agents observe the same contract dimensions.
