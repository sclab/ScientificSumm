A session includes a single query and all the URLs that a user clicked after issuing the query [24].
Specifically, given the query in a session, we obtain its top-ranked results using the search engine from which we obtained our log data, and extract the snippets of the URLs that are clicked on according to the log information in the corresponding session.
Our idea of using search engine logs is to treat these logs as past history, learn users" interests using this history data automatically, and represent their interests by  representative queries.
Some are looking for renting a car, thus may submit a query like car rental; some are more interested in buying a used car, and may submit a query like used car; and others may care more about buying a car accessory, so they may use a query like car audio.
Each session contains the information of the text query and the clicked Web page URLs, together with the time that the user did the clicks.
All the titles, snippets, and URLs of the clicked Web pages of that query are used to represent the session.
For example, in the search logs, a lot of queries are related to car and this reflects that a large number of users are interested in information about car.
That is, for each unique query, we build a pseudo-document which consists of all the descriptions of its clicks in all the sessions aggregated.
In order to learn aspects from search engine logs, we  preprocess the raw logs to build a history data collection.
They generally have the following  information: text queries that users submitted, the URLs that they clicked after submitting the queries, and the time when they clicked.
1. car rental, hertz car rental, enterprise car rental, ... 2. car pricing, used car, car values, ... 3. car accidents, car crash, car wrecks, ... 4. car audio, car stereo, car speaker, ...
Different sessions may contain the same queries.
By mining all the queries which are related to the concept of car, we can learn the aspects that are likely interesting from a user"s perspective.
Search engine logs are separated by sessions.
Search engine logs record the activities of Web users, which reflect the actual users" needs or interests when conducting ID Query URL Time 1 win zip http://www.winzip.com xxxx 1 win zip http://www.swinzip.com/winzip xxxx 2 time zones http://www.timeanddate.com xxxx ... ... ... ... Table 1: Sample entries of search engine logs.
As an example, the following is some aspects about car learned from our search log data (see Section 5).
As shown above, search engine logs consist of sessions.
All these pseudo-documents form our history data collection, which is used to learn interesting aspects in the following section. 
The keywords contained in the queries themselves can be regarded as brief summaries of the pseudo-documents.
To gather rich information, we enrich each URL with additional text content.
Thus the number of sessions could be quite huge and the  information in the sessions with the same queries could be  redundant.
In order to improve the scalability and reduce data sparseness, we aggregate all the sessions which contain  exactly the same queries together.
Different users are probably interested in different aspects of car.
Web search.
A small sample of search log data is shown in Table 1.
However, this information is limited since URLs alone are not informative enough to tell the  intended meaning of a submitted query accurately.
Different ID"s mean different sessions.
