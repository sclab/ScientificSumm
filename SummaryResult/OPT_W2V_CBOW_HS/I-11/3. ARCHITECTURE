First, we can generate the pheromone fields directly from the observed locations of individual entities, so there is no need for the ghosts to make deposits.
At the insertion horizon, each ghost"s behavioral parameters (desires and dispositions) are sampled from distributions to explore alternative personalities of the entity it represents.
At each step, Ghosts reaching the = t page are evaluated for fitness and removed or evolved; New ghosts from the avatars and from the evolutionary process are inserted at the insertion horizon; A population of ghosts based on the fittest ghosts are inserted at = t to run into the future; Ghosts that have moved beyond the prediction horizon are removed; All ghosts plan their next actions based on the pheromone field in the pages they currently occupy; The system computes the next state of each page, including executing the actions elected by the ghosts, and (in future pages) evaporating pheromones and recording new deposits from the recently arrived ghosts.
BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.
Second, we can adjust the pheromone intensities based on the changed locations of entities from page to page, so we do not need to evaporate or propagate the pheromones.
Real-world observations.-Observations from the real world are encoded into the pheromone field each increment of BEE time, as a new current page is generated.
Dispositions are relatively stable, and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE, while Emotions vary based on the agent"s disposition and the stimuli to which it is  exposed.
Key elements of the BEE  architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute.
An important advance in BEE"s emotional model is the recognition that agents may differ in how sensitive they are to triggers.
As ghosts move from page to page, they interact with this past state, based on their behavioral parameters.
Statistical estimates of threat regions.-Statistical  techniques1 estimate the level of threat to each force (Red or Blue), based on the topology of the battlefield and the known disposition of forces.
At each step, The former now + 1page is replaced with a new current page, whose pheromones correspond to the locations and strengths of observed units; An empty page is added at the prediction horizon; The oldest page is discarded, since it has passed the insertion horizon.
In pages representing the past ( t), we have an observed state of the real world.
The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion (e.g., fear, compassion,  aggression), and the use of the term personality in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking  anthropomorphically, though they do not use emotion to describe the effect they are trying to achieve.
In our current system, the insertion horizon is at - t = -30, meaning that ghosts are inserted into a page representing the state of the world 30 minutes ago.

3.1 Agent Model The agents in BEE are inspired by two  bodies of work: our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through  digital pheromones in a shared environment [2, 13, 17, 18, 21], and the success of previous  agentbased combat modeling.
Table 1 identifies the entities that generate each flavor of pheromone.
For example, threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear, but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran.
The Sixth Intl.
Since there are about 50  entities in the battlespace (about 20 units each of Red and Blue and about 5 of Green), we must support about 400 ghosts per page, or about 24000 over the entire book.
EINSTein [6] represents an agent as a set of six weights, each in [-1, 1], describing the agent"s response to six kinds of  information.
In our experiments, we apply BEE to a simulated battle, and domain time is the time stamp published by the simulator.
Digital pheromones are scalar variables that agents deposit and sense at their current location a c b d a c b d Figure 1: Tracking a  nonlinear dynamical system.

Four of these describe the number of alive friendly, alive enemy, injured friendly, and injured enemy troops within the agent"s sensor range.
Ghosts include their distance to such points in their action decisions, achieving the  result of gradient following without the computational expense of maintaining a pheromone field. 
The distribution of each pheromone flavor over the  environment forms a field that represents some aspect of the state of the world at an instant in time.
The behavior of the pheromones on each page  depends on whether the page represents the past or the future.
Emotions are modeled as agent hormones (internal pheromones) that are augmented in the presence of the triggering environmental condition and evaporate over time.
Each active entity in the battlespace has an persistent avatar that continuously  generates a stream of ghost agents  representing itself.
Ghosts deposit pheromone each time they move to a new page, and pheromones evaporate and propagate from one page to the next.
The other two weights relate to the agent"s distance to its own flag and that of the adversary, representing objectives that it seeks to protect and attack, respectively.
The personality vectors in MANA and EINSTein reflect both rational and emotive aspects of decision-making.
The right side is the emotive component, where an appraisal of the agent"s beliefs, moderated by the disposition, leads to an emotion that in turn influences the BDI analysis.
Then a shift rate of n/p shifts per second will permit ghosts to run from the  insertion horizon to the current time at least once before a new page is generated.
Thus BEE has three distinct notions of time, all of which may be distinct from real-world time.
The fittest ghosts have three functions.
The Sixth Intl.
A BEE agent"s rationality is a vector of seven desires, which are values in [-1, +1]: ProtectRed (the adversary), ProtectBlue (friendly forces), ProtectGreen (civilians), ProtectKeySites, AvoidCombat, AvoidDetection, and Survive.
The personality of each entity"s fittest ghost is reported to the rest of the system as the likely personality of that entity.
Each ghost that runs into the future explores a different possible future of the battle, analogous to how some people plan ahead by mentally simulating different ways that a situation might unfold.
Each page between the insertion horizon and = t (now) records the historical state of the world at the point in the past to which it corresponds.
At this point, each ghost is evaluated based on its location compared with the actual location of its corresponding real-world entity.
Ghosts live on a timeline indexed by that begins in the past and runs into the future.
The results of this process are posted to the pheromone pages as RedThreat pheromone (representing a threat to red) and BlueThreat pheromone (representing a threat to Blue).
During actual runs, the simulator is often paused, so domain time runs slower than real time.
OCC define emotions as valanced  reactions to agents, states, or events in the environment.
The relation between shift time and real time depends on the processing resources available.
Execution of the pheromone infrastructure proceeds on two time scales, running in separate threads.
Their movements change the deposit patterns.
They evolve against the entity"s recent observed behavior, and the fittest ghosts run into the future to generate predictions.
3.3 Information sources The flexibility of the BEE"s pheromone infrastructure  permits the integration of numerous information sources as input to our characterizations of entity personalities and predictions of their future behavior.
The second thread moves the ghosts from one page to the next, as fast as the processor allows.
Each page of the timeline is a  complete pheromone field for the world at the BEE time represented by that page.
For example, RED-CASUALTY pheromone stimulates both Anger and Fear in a Red agent, but not in a Blue agent.
In  addition, it defines a set of triggers (e.g., reaching a waypoint, being shot at, making contact with the enemy, being injured) that shift the agent from one personality vector to another.
A default state defines the personality vector when no trigger state is active.
Thus we use simple agents coordinated using pheromone mechanisms.
When we replay logs from simulation runs, we can speed them up so that domain time runs faster than real time.
Our soldier agents are inspired by EINSTein and MANA.
We  dynamically configure a Bayes net based on heuristics to identify the likely goals that each entity may hold.2 The destinations of these goals function as virtual pheromones.
We call the combined modeling entity consisting of avatar and ghosts a polyagent [14].
The fittest ghosts for each entity form the basis for a population of ghosts that run past the avatar's present into the future.
Each node maintains a scalar value for each flavor of pheromone, and provides three functions: It aggregates deposits from individual agents, fusing information across multiple agents and through time.
This notion of reaction is captured in MANA"s trigger states.
BEE time for a page records the domain time corresponding to the state of the world represented on that page, and is offset from the current domain time.
This section describes this process at a high level, then details the multi-page pheromone infrastructure that  implements it.
Domain time t is the current time in the domain being modeled.
When we introduce noise and uncertainty, we will probably need to introduce dynamic pheromones in the past as well as the future.
This information enables us to characterize individual warriors as unusually cowardly or brave.
Each avatar generates a stream of ghosts that sample the personality space of its entity.
Interviews with military domain experts identified the two most crucial emotions for combat behavior as Anger (with the corresponding disposition Irritability) and Fear (whose disposition is Cowardice).
For example, a negative value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red, and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to  REDALIVE, RED-CASUALTY, and MOBILITY pheromone, and will move at maximum speed.
3.2.2 Pheromone Infrastructure BEE must operate very rapidly, to keep pace with the ongoing battle.
The first thread updates the book of pages each time the  domain time advances past the next page boundary.
These interactions mean that their fitness depends not just on their own actions, but also on the behaviors of the rest of the  population, which is also evolving.
If BEE is applied to a real-world situation, this time is the same as real-world time.
Shift time is incremented every time the ghosts move from one page to the next.
Both of these simplifications reflect the fact that in our current system, we have complete knowledge of the past.
It evaporates pheromones over time, providing an innovative alternative to traditional truth maintenance.
Ghost movement based on pheromone gradients is a simple process, so this system can support realistic agent populations without excessive computer load.
The fittest ghosts breed genetically and their offspring return to the insertion horizon to continue the fitting process.
is offset with respect to the current time t. The timeline is divided into discrete pages, each representing a successive value of .
This has two consequences for pheromone management.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1429 In pages representing the future ( > t), the usual pheromone mechanisms apply.
a = system state space; b = system trajectory over time; c = recent measurements of system state; d = short-range prediction.
Thus our model includes not only  Emotions, but Dispositions.
The left side is a straightforward BDI model (we prefer the term goal to intention).
In our current system, each  avatar generates eight ghosts per shift.
For example, a living member of the  adversary emits a RED-ALIVE pheromone, while roads emit a MOBILITY pheromone.
Table 2 shows which pheromones trigger which emotions.
Our current system draws on three sources of information, but others can readily be added.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1427 in the environment.
Analysis of the behaviors of these different possible futures yields predictions.
Let n be the number of pages between the insertion horizon and = t. In our current system, n = 30.
This feedback loop, together with processes of evaporation and propagation in the environment, support complex patterns of interaction and  coordination among the agents [15].
This infrastructure runs on the nodes of a graph-structured environment (in the case of BEE, a rectangular lattice).
Agents respond to local concentrations of these variables tropistically, climbing or descending local  gradients.
A non-zero emotion modifies the agent"s actions.
The emotive component of a BEE"s personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) framework [11], and is described in detail elsewhere [12].
We have described the basic dynamics of our pheromone  infrastructure elsewhere [2].
Let p be the real-time  duration of a page in seconds.
Each Emotion has a corresponding  Disposition.
Thus inconsistencies automatically remove themselves within a known period.
Table 1 shows the BEE"s  current pheromone flavors.
The avatar inserts the ghosts at the  insertion horizon.
Figure 2 summarizes the BEE"s personality model.
The notion of waypoints to which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality.
It diffuses pheromones to nearby places, disseminating information for access by nearby agents.
Pheromone-based systems immediately begin to forget everything they learn, unless it is continually reinforced.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 3.2 The BEE Cycle BEE"s major innovation is  extending the nonlinear systems technique of Section 2.2 to agent behaviors.
A  positive weight indicates attraction to the entity described by the weight, while a negative weight indicates repulsion.
Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label.
Elevated level Anger increases movement likelihood, weapon firing  likelihood, and tendency toward an exposed posture.
Because advances faster than real time, eventually = t (actual time).
If each page represents 60 seconds of domain time, and we are replaying a simulation at 2x domain time, p = 30.
BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model.
Friendly and enemy flags are replaced by the waypoints pursued by each side.
Elevated Fear decreases these likelihoods.
AI-based plan recognition.-While plan recognition is not sufficient for effective prediction, it is a valuable input.
3.2.1 Overview Figure 3 is an overview of  Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation.
How fast a processor do we need?
Traditionally, knowledge bases remember everything they are told unless they have a reason to forget.
For example, a broad open area with no cover is  threatening, especially if the opposite force occupies its margins.
Empirically, this level is a lower bound for reasonable performance, and easily achievable on stock WinTel platforms.
MANA includes low, medium, and high threat enemies.
MANA [9] extends the concepts in EINSTein.
