Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed  learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) to capture complex forms of interaction between  heterogeneous and/or self-interested learners in an architecture that can be used as the foundation for implementing systems that use complex interaction and reasoning mechanisms to enable agents to inform and improve their learning abilities with information provided by other learners in the system,  provided that all agents engage in a sufficiently similar learning activity.
In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here, and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a useful  integration of different agents" learning processes.
These issues, together with a more systematic and  thorough investigation of advanced interaction and  communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and  competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.
This framework constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt 684 The Sixth Intl.
To illustrate that the abstract principles of our  architecture can be turned into concrete, computational systems, we described a market-based distributed clustering system which was evaluated in the domain of vessel tracking for purposes of identifying deviant or suspicious behaviour.
Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g.
Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical  evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of  communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.
Although our experimental results only hint at the potential of using our architecture, they underline that what we are proposing is feasible in principle and can have beneficial  effects even in its most simple instantiation.
In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining.
This is of course  inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of  learning results.
