Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.
Our work focuses on query performance prediction for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page finding task in the context of web retrieval.
Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.
For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.
However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.
In fact, according to the report on the NP task of the 2005 Terabyte Track [3], about 40% of the test queries perform poorly (no correct answer in the first 10 search results) even in the best run from the top group.
Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.
With the popularity and influence of the Web, prediction techniques that will work well for web-style queries are highly preferable.
For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].
Current prediction techniques can be vulnerable to these characteristics of web collections.
To our knowledge, little research has explicitly addressed the problem of NP-query performance prediction.
Query feedback and first rank change, which are our second and third prediction techniques, perform well for content-based queries and NP queries respectively.
Most work on prediction has focused on the traditional ad-hoc retrieval task where query performance is measured according to topical relevance.
In this paper, we present three techniques to address the above challenges that current prediction models face in Web search environments.
The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.
Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.
Our main contributions include: (1) considerably improved prediction accuracy for web content-based queries over several state-of-the-art techniques.
In addition, one minor contribution is that we find that the robustness score [1], which was originally proposed for performance prediction, is helpful for query classification. 
We find that WIG offers consistent prediction accuracy across various test collections and query types.
Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.
First, web collections, which are much larger than conventional TREC collections, include a variety of documents that are different in many aspects such as quality and style.
Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using WIG with the help of a query type classifier.
(2) new techniques for successfully predicting NP-query performance.
Query performance prediction has many applications in a variety of information retrieval (IR) areas such as improving retrieval consistency, query refinement, and distributed IR.
For example, the Named-Page (NP) finding task, which is a navigational task, is also popular in web retrieval.
Our first technique, called weighted information gain (WIG), makes use of both single term and term proximity features to estimate the quality of top retrieved documents for prediction.
(3) a practical and fully automatic solution to predicting mixed-query performance.
These prediction models are evaluated on TREC document collections which typically consist of no more than one million relatively homogenous newswire articles.
The importance of this problem has been recognized by IR researchers and a number of new methods have been proposed for prediction recently [1, 2, 17].
Query performance prediction for the NP task is still necessary since NP retrieval performance is far from perfect.
Here we outline some of these challenges.
