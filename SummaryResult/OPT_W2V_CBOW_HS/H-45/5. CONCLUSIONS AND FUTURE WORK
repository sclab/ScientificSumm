To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.
Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.
On the other hand, the computation of QF and FRC is relatively less efficient since QF needs to retrieve the whole collection twice and FRC needs to repeatedly rank the perturbed documents.
Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.
How to improve the efficiency of QF and FRC is our future work.
For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.
Fortunately, since the WIG score is computed just over the terms and the phrases that appear in the query, this calculation can be made very efficient with the support of index.
We demonstrated that the WIG method is particularly suitable for this situation.
In addition, the prediction techniques proposed in this paper have the potential of improving retrieval performance by combining with other IR techniques.
Guided by performance prediction, we can make a better decision on when to or how to modify queries to enhance retrieval effectiveness.
Furthermore, we considered a more realistic case that no prior information on query types is available.
We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.
We would like to carry out research in this direction in the future. 
In this paper, we focus on two types of queries in web search: content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding queries, corresponding to the ad-hoc retrieval task and the Named-Page finding task respectively.
For example, our techniques can be incorporated to popular query modification techniques such as query expansion and query relaxation.
