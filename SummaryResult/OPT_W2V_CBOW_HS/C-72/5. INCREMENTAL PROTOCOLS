Using delete vectors, we can now support updates to the measured signal level.
Update Received OR Local Update Occurs Recovered Susceptible Time-stamp Expires Initial State Additional Update Received Infectious Clean Up Figure 3: State diagram each device passes through as updates proceed in the system • Incremental Gossip Protocol (IGP): When an  update occurs, the updated node initiates the gossiping procedure.
A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level.
• Incremental Random Walk Protocol (IRWP): When an update (or updates) occur in the system,  instead of starting random walks at k random nodes in the network, all k random walks are initiated from the updated node(s).
With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.
We maintain a  separate aggregate delete vector whose value is subtracted from the original aggregate vector"s value to obtain the resulting value as follows.
The vectors are updated as follows.
Therefore, nodes receiving the  update become active and continue communicating with their neighbors until the update protocol terminates, after O(log(N)) time steps.
• s < s: We increase the value of the delete vector by performing (s − s ) coin toss experiments and bitwise OR the result with the current delete vector.
The rest of the protocol proceeds in the same fashion as the standard random walk  protocol.
Now suppose that the measured signal at a node changes from s to s .
• s > s: We simply perform (s − s) more coin toss  experiments and bitwise OR the result with the original bit vector.
AGGINC = (2a−1 /0.77351) − (2b−1 /0.77351) (1) Here, a and b represent the bit positions of the least  significant zero in the original and delete bit vectors respectively.
The allocation of walks to updates is discussed in more detail in [3], where the authors show that the number of walks has an almost negligible impact on network overhead. 
To compute this, we  compute the SUM of all signal level measurements and divide that by the COUNT of the number of measurements.
Other nodes only begin gossiping once they receive the update.
We propose the use of delete vectors, an extension of FM to support updates.
Figure 2 illustrates the sequence by which the average signal energy is computed in a particular band using FM  aggregation.
Due to the probabilistic nature of FM, once bit vectors have been ORed together, information cannot simply be removed from them as each node"s contribution has not been recorded.
5.2 Incremental Routing Protocol We use the following incremental variants of the routing protocols presented in Section 4.2 to support incremental updates to previously computed aggregates.
Next we discuss how these aggregates can be communicated between devices using incremental routing protocols.
Suppose we wish to compute the average signal level  detected in a particular frequency.
Thus, delete vectors provide a low overhead alternative for applications whose data changes incrementally, such as signal level  measurements in a coordinated spectrum sensing environment.
5.1 Incremental FM Aggregates One limitation of FM aggregation is that it does not  support updates.
