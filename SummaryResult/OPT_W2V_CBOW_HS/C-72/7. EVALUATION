We study the improvements of our  incremental gossip protocols over standard gossiping in two  dimensions: execution time and network overhead.
These improvements carry over to a PLRG topology as well (as shown in Figure 4(c)), where IRWP is 1.33 times faster than random walk.
In each run of the simulation, we induce a change in the measured signal at one or more devices.
Finally, in order to isolate the effect of protocol  operation on performance, we do not model the complexities of the wireless channel in our simulations.
We also assume nodes are loosely time  synchronized, the implications of which are discussed further in [3].
Here we focus on how incremental  extensions to gossip protocols can lead to further improvements over standard gossiping techniques, for the problem of  coordinated spectrum sensing.
Incremental Protocols Reduce Network Overhead: Figure 5(a) shows the ratio of data transmitted using  uniform gossip relative to incremental gossip on a clique.
Although random walk and IRWP both use k random walks (in our simulations k = number of nodes), IRWP initiates walks only from  updated nodes (as explained in Section 5.2), resulting in faster information convergence.
A run ends when the new average signal level has converged in the network.
To compute the AVERAGE aggregate, four bit vectors need to be transmitted: the original SUM vector, the SUM delete vector, the original COUNT vector, and the COUNT delete vector.
We use two topologies to represent device connectivity: a clique, to  eliminate the effects of the underlying topology on protocol  performance, and a BRITE-generated [13] power-law random graph (PLRG), to illustrate how our results extend to more realistic scenarios.
We simulate a large deployment of 1,000 devices to analyze protocol scalability.
Because spectrum  utilization is characterized by incremental changes to usage, incremental protocols are ideally suited to solve this  problem in an efficient and cost effective manner. 
Incremental Protocols Reduce Execution Time: Figure 4(a) compares the performance of incremental gossip (IGP) with uniform gossip on a clique topology.
Although each protocol uses the same number of random walks, IRWP uses fewer network resources than random walk because it takes less time to converge.
Each transmission also includes a time stamp of when the update was generated.
From these results it is clear that incremental techniques yield significant improvements over standard approaches to gossip, even on complex topologies.
We observe that both protocols have almost identical execution times.
As more signal changes are introduced into the system, gossip and incremental  gossip incur approximately the same overhead.
In our simulations, we compute the average signal level in a particular band by disseminating FM bit vectors.
Sequential use of the control channel is a worst case for our protocols; in practice, multiple control channels could be used in parallel to reduce execution time.
This improvement also holds true on more  complex PLRG topologies (as shown in Figure 5(c)), where we observe a 33% reduction in network overhead.
We now provide a preliminary evaluation of GUESS in simulation.
This is expected as IGP operates in a similar fashion to 16 uniform gossip, taking O(log(N)) time-steps to converge.
Therefore, one time-step of protocol  execution corresponds to the time required for 1,000 nodes to sequentially send 70 bits at 2 Mbps.
For a small number of signal changes, incremental gossip incurs 2.4 times less overhead than uniform gossip.
We assume nodes communicate on a common control  channel at 2 Mbps.
Figure 4(b) compares the execution times of  incremental random walk (IRWP) and standard random walk on a clique.
IRWP reduces execution time by a factor of 2.7 for a small number of measured signal changes.
Simulation Parameters: Each transmission involves sending 70 bits of information to a neighboring node.
Figure 5(b) shows a 2.7 fold reduction in overhead for small numbers of  signal changes on a clique.
This is because in the early steps of protocol execution, only devices which detect signal changes communicate.
Similarly, incremental random walk (IRWP) incurs much less overhead than standard random walk.
Non-incremental protocols do not transmit the delete vectors.
Simulation Setup: We implemented a custom  simulator in C++.
A more detailed evaluation of this approach can be found in [3].
For each data point, we ran 100 simulations and 95%  confidence intervals (error bars) are shown.
