One challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.
As well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing  information.
Weighted Readings: Although we argued that most devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing  equipment, there may be situations where there are some special infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than others.
The trade-offs of different approaches to implementing GUESS is a subject of future work. 
Therefore, we recommend the use of  spatially decaying aggregates [6], which limits the impact of an update on more distant nodes.
Spatial Decay: Devices performing coordinated sensing are primarily interested in the spectrum usage of their local neighborhood.
Spatially decaying  aggregates work by successively reducing (by means of a decay function) the value of the update as it propagates further from its origin.
Choosing an appropriate operating value for β is application dependent, and explored further in [3].
We have only just scratched the surface in addressing the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing using incremental gossiping.
Deciding if a change is significant can be done using a significance threshold β, below which any  observed change is not propagated by the node.
Implementation Specifics: Finally, implementing  gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open.
Weighting their measurements more heavily could be used to maintain a higher degree of accuracy.
Therefore, finding the optimal decay function is non-trivial, and an interesting subject of future work.
There are a variety of alternatives for  implementing such a channel, some of which are outlined in [4].
Significance Threshold: RF spectrum bands  continually experience small-scale changes which may not  necessarily be significant.
Determining how to assign such weights is an open area of research.
If  implemented at the MAC layer, it may be feasible to piggy-back gossip messages over existing management frames (e.g.
Next, we outline some open areas of research.
