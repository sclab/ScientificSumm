These algorithms are well suited to coordinated spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of the problem: i.e.
This can be done by sensing the environment to detect the presence of primary users.
Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more  important than absolute usage data.
Coordinating sensory data between cognitive radio devices is technically challenging because accurately assessing  spectrum usage requires exchanging potentially large amounts of data with many radios at very short time scales.
The second type of allocation scheme is termed opportunistic spectrum sharing.
Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes  substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an  update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.
New spectrum allocation regimes implemented by the FCC use dynamic spectrum access schemes to either negotiate or  opportunistically allocate RF spectrum to unlicensed secondary users Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
Spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks [4, 17] are broadly classified into three regimes; (1)  centralized coordinated techniques, (2) decentralized coordinated techniques, and (3) decentralized uncoordinated techniques.

Section 2 motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to coordinated spectrum sensing.
We defer the problem of spectrum allocation to future work.
As a result, a new wave of  intelligent radios, termed cognitive radios (or software defined radios), is emerging that can dynamically re-tune their  radio parameters based on interactions with their surrounding environment.
Here, coordination between secondary users is the only way for shadowed users to  detect the primary.
Low-cost sensors collect approximate data: Most  devices have limited sensing resolution because they are low-cost and low duty-cycle devices and thus cannot perform complex RF signal processing (e.g.
In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations.
This data must also be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid changes in the RF environment.
The FCC has already legislated this access method for the 5 GHz band and is also considering the same for TV broadcast bands [1].
This paper presents GUESS, a novel approach to  coordinated spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks.
Thus, exchanging  exact RF information may not be necessary, and more importantly, too costly for the purposes of spectrum sensing.
This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches  because making decisions based only on local information is fallible (as shown in Figure 1).
A novel approach that applies randomized gossiping  algorithms to the problem of coordinated spectrum  sensing.
However, this has come at the cost of increased RF interference, which has caused the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States to re-evaluate its strategy on spectrum allocation.
We argue that  approximate summaries are adequate for performing accurate radio parameter tuning.
However, local sensing is not always adequate, especially in cases where a secondary user is shadowed from a primary user, as illustrated in Figure 1.
To realize this vision of dynamic spectrum access, two  fundamental problems must be solved: (1) Efficient and  coordinated spectrum sensing and (2) Distributed spectrum  allocation.
This allows rapid detection of change while saving the overhead of exchanging unnecessary information.
In general, cooperation improves sensing accuracy by an order of magnitude when compared to not cooperating at all [5].
radios are power-limited, mobile and have limited bandwidth to support spectrum sensing capabilities.
that can use it when the primary user is absent.
There has recently been a huge surge in the growth of wireless technology, driven primarily by the availability of unlicensed spectrum.
Sections 5 and 6 discuss extensions and protocol details of these  techniques for coordinated spectrum sensing.
Many are typically equipped with simple energy detectors that gather only approximate  information.
An application of in-network aggregation for  dissemination of spectrum summaries.
Section 3 discusses related work in the area, while Section 4 provides a background on in-network aggregation and randomized gossiping.
An extension of in-network aggregation and  randomized gossiping to support incremental maintenance of spectrum summaries.
Under the new opportunistic allocation strategy,  secondary users are obligated not to interfere with primary users (senders or receivers).
Compared to standard  gossiping approaches, incremental techniques can further  reduce overhead and protocol execution time by  requiring fewer radio resources.
Our approach is motivated by the following key observations: 1.
Moreover, utilization of a specific RF band affects only that band and not the entire spectrum.
We advocate a decentralized coordinated approach, similar in spirit to OSPF link-state routing used in the Internet.
thousands) of spectrum bands that must be scanned.
Based on these observations, GUESS makes the following contributions: 1.
Moreover, compared to  cen12 tralized approaches, decentralized techniques are more  scalable, robust, and resistant to network failures and security attacks (e.g.
Currently, the FCC has licensed RF spectrum to a variety of public and private institutions, termed primary users.

RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently.
Data size grows rapidly due to the large number (i.e.
