Each topic has a separate page that shows all experts associated with that topic and, if available, a list of related topics.
The UvT Expert collection was extracted from a different  organizational setting than the W3C collection and differs from it in a number of ways.
Another important difference between the two data sets is that the  expertise areas in the UvT Expert collection are self-selected instead of being based on group membership or assignments by others.
(This means that if experts put the full-text versions of their publications on their academic homepage, these were also available for indexing.)
of experts with RD 329 313 no.
Webwijs (http://www.uvt.nl/ webwijs/) is a publicly accessible database of UvT employees who are involved in research or teaching; currently, Webwijs  contains information about 1168 experts, each of whom has a page with contact information and, if made available by the expert, a research description and publications list.
In the UvT Expert collection we have  information about the affiliations of researchers with faculties and institutes, providing us with a two-level organizational hierarchy.

These home pages were crawled and added to the collection.
Tilburg University has 22 organizational units at the faculty level (including the university office and several research institutes) and 71 departments, which amounts to 3.2 departments per faculty.
The UvT Expert collection used in the experiments in this paper fits the scenario outlined in Section 3.
of experts with â‰¥ 1 topic 743 727 no.
In addition, each expert can  select expertise areas from a list of 1491 topics and is encouraged to suggest new topics that need to be approved by the Webwijs editor.

Also realistic are the large differences in the amount of information available for each expert.
In  addition, about 27% of the experts link to their academic homepage from their Webwijs page.
The collection covers a broad range of expertise areas, as one can typically find on intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive institutes.
We ran the TextCat [23] language identifier to classify the language of the home pages and the  fulltext publications.
As to the topical hierarchy used by Webwijs, 131 of the 1491 topics are top nodes in the hierarchy.
of experts 1168 1168 no.
About 42% of the experts teach courses at Tilburg University; these courses were also crawled and included in the profile.
Additionally, our university setting features several types of structure  (topical and organizational), as well as multiple document types.
of PUB citations per expert 25.2 25.2 avg.
Universities tend to have a hierarchical structure that goes from the faculty level, to departments, research groups, down to the  individual researchers.
We restricted ourselves to pages where the  classifier was confident about the language used on the page.
This hierarchy has an average topic chain length of 2.65 and a maximum length of 7 topics. 
of topics 1491 981 no.
This resulted in four document types: research descriptions (RD), course descriptions (CD), publications (PUB; full-text and  citationonly versions), and academic homepages (HP).
of PUBs per expert 27.0 27.0 avg.
Size is another dimension along which the W3C and UvT Expert collections differ: the latter is the smaller of the two.
Everything was bundled into the UvT Expert collection which is available at http: //ilk.uvt.nl/uvt-expert-collection/.
We also obtained 1880 full-text versions of publications from the UvT institutional repository and Dutch English no.
of experts with HP 318 318 no.
Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the UvT Expert collection.
Document-author associations are clear and the data is structured and clean.
This leaves us with 743 Dutch and 727 English usable expert profiles.
The UvT setting is one with relatively small amounts of multilingual data.
The collection is based on the Webwijs (Webwise) system developed at Tilburg University (UvT) in the Netherlands.
