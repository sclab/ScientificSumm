System-3: this system is the same as system-1 except that it uses the new detection procedure which is based on indexing-tree.
7.2 Parameter selection for indexing-tree detection Figure 3 shows the minimum normalized costs obtained by system-3 on TDT3 using different parameters.
System-4 adjusts term weights based on the distance of term distributions between the whole corpus and cluster story set, yielding a good improvement by 0.0468 compared to system-1.
System-2: this system is the same as system-1 except that S-C detection procedure is used.
The following are some other NED systems: System-6: [21] for each pair of stories, it computes three similarity values for named entity, non-named entity and all terms respectively.

System-5 achieves the minimum cost at a false alarm rate of 0.0157 and a miss rate of 0.4310.
System-5 outperforms all other systems including system-6, and it performs only 2.78e+8 comparing times in detection procedure which is only 13.4% of system-1.
Comparing times on TDT3 (δ =0.15) Figure 4 gives the comparing times used by system-3 on TDT3 with the same parameters as figure 3.
And system-3 is basically equivalent to system-1 in accuracy results.

System-4: implemented based on the approach presented in section 5.1, i.e., terms are reweighted according to the distance between term distributions in a cluster and all stories.
This is easy to explain, because when stories belonging to the same topic are put in a cluster, it is more reasonable for the cluster to represent the stories in it.
This is because story-story comparisons usually yield greater similarities than story-cluster ones, so stories tend to be combined Location Person Date Organization Money Percentage NN JJ CD Elections 0.37 1 0.04 0.58 0.08 0.03 0.32 0.13 0.1 Scandals/Hearings 0.66 0.62 0.28 1 0.11 0.02 0.27 0.13 0.05 Legal/Criminal Cases 0.48 1 0.02 0.62 0.15 0 0.22 0.24 0.09 Natural Disasters 1 0.27 0 0.04 0.04 0 0.25 0.04 0.02 Violence or War 1 0.36 0.02 0.14 0.02 0.04 0.21 0.11 0.02 Science and Discovery 0.11 1 0.01 0.22 0.08 0.12 0.19 0.08 0.03 Finances 1 0.45 0.04 0.98 0.13 0.02 0.29 0.06 0.05 Sports 0.16 0.27 0.01 1 0.02 0 0.11 0.03 0.01 together in system-3.
We can observe that  System4 and System-5 obtain lower miss probability at regions of low false alarm probabilities.
Since no heldout data set for fine-tuning the threshold θ new was available for experiments on TDT2, we only report minimum normalized costs for our systems in table 3.
System-5: implemented based on the approach presented in section 5.2, i.e., terms of different types are reweighted according to news class using trained parameters.
Further more, system-5 only needs 1.05e+8 comparing times which is 14.9% of system-1.
Similarity score between two stories belonging to different topics are lower than before, because their overlapping terms are usually not key terms of their topics.

Table 3 and table 4 show topic-weighted normalized costs and comparing times on TDT2 and TDT3 datasets respectively.
In this parameter setting, we can get both low minimum normalized costs and less comparing times.
The hypothesis is that, more weight value is transferred to key terms of topics from non-key terms.
It is implemented based on the basic model described in section 3, i.e., using incremental TF-IDF model to generate term weights, and using Hellinger distance to compute document similarity.
The best system (system-5) has a minimum normalized cost 0.5012, which is 0.0797 better than system-1, and also better than any other results previously reported for this dataset [8, 13].
And the λ parameter is tested on four values 1, 2, 3 and 4.
The comparing times are strongly dependent onθ init.
7.1 Main Results To test the approaches proposed in the model, we implemented and tested five systems: System-1: this system is used as baseline.
Because the greaterθ init is, the less stories combined together, the more comparing times are needed for new event decision.
System-8: [13] it split document representation into two parts: named entities and non-named entities, and choose one effective part for each news class.
System-3 uses the new detection procedure based on news indexing-tree.
System-7: [8] it extended a basic incremental TF-IDF model to include source-specific models, similarity score normalization based on document-specific averages, similarity score normalization based on source-pair specific averages, etc.
System-2 reduces comparing times to 1.29e+9 which is just 18.3% of system-1, but at the same time it also gets a deteriorated minimum normalized cost which is 0.0499 higher than system-1.
We can see that, whenθ init is set to 0.12, which is the closest one toθ new, the costs are lower than others.
The new detection procedure is used.
The new detection procedure is used.

So we useθ init =0.13,λ =3,δ =0.15 for system-3, 4, and 5.
When parameter λ is set to 3 or 4, the costs are better than other cases, but there is no much difference between 3 and 4.
And employ Support Vector Machine to predict new or old using the similarity values as features.
Similarity score normalization is also employed [8].
Theθ init parameter is tested on six values spanning from 0.03 to 0.18.
S-S detection procedure is used.
It requires even less comparing times than system-2.
