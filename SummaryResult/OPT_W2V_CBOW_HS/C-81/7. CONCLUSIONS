Our method has significant advantages over currently used methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and can only provide sub-optimal performance.
It is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the duty cycle.
Specifically, we designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the constraint of energy neutral operation.
However, this work is only the first step towards optimal solutions for energy neutral operation.
We discussed various issues in power management for systems powered using environmentally harvested energy.
It is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit these advanced capabilities. 
Several other power scaling methods, such as DVS,  submodule power switching and the use of multiple low power modes are also available.
We also derived a theoretically optimal bound on the performance and showed that our proposed algorithm operated very close to the optimal.
The proposals were evaluated using real data collected using an energy harvesting sensor node deployed in an outdoor environment.
