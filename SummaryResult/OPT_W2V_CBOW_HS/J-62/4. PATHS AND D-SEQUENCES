For v, w ∈ D and b, c ∈ A, we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Svw .
For −→u ∈ C(−→a ) we define ∆−→a (−→u ) = |−→a |−1 X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)).
The δ-weight of path −→a is defined by δ(−→a ) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 .
Hence ∆−→a (−→u ) − ∆−→a (−→u ) = 0. 
For b, c ∈ A we write Pbc for the set of (b, c)-paths and SPbc for the set of simple (b, c)-paths.
Since ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = u1(a1) + k−1X i=2 (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − uk−1(ak) = u1(b) + k−1X i=2 (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − uk−1(c), ∆−→a (−→u ) − ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=2 ((ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai))) = k−1X i=2 ((ui(ai) − ui(ai)) − (ui−1(ai) − ui−1(ai))).
D-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is compatible with both path (a, b, c, e) and path (a, b, d, e); D-sequence (v, w, u, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (a, b, d, e).
A compatible pair is a pair (−→a , −→u ) where −→a is a path and −→u is a D-sequence satisfying ord(−→u ) = |−→a | and for each i ∈ [k], both ui−1 and ui belong to Dai .
We write C(−→a ) for the set of D-sequences −→u that are compatible with −→a .
For a D-sequence −→u , we write ord(u) for the order of −→u .
Therefore, ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 = δ(−→a ).
D-sequence (x, w, p, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (b, a, d, e).
Let −→u be a D-sequence in C(−→a ) ∩ C(−→a ).
By proposition 6, δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ) and δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ), it suffices to show ∆−→a (−→u ) = ∆−→a (−→u ).
Let k = ord(−→u ) = |−→a |.
Let b, c ∈ A and let −→a , −→a ∈ Pbc.
Noticing both ui−1 and ui belong to Dai ∩ Dai , we have by proposition 5 ui−1(ai) − ui−1(ai) = δaiai = ui(ai) − ui(ai).
For v, w ∈ D we write Svw for the set of (v, w)-sequences.
Hence (a, b, c, e), (a, b, d, e) and (b, a, d, e) are  admissible paths.
For a path −→a , we write |−→a | for the size of −→a .
Let k = ord(−→u ) = |−→a | = |−→a |.
For any compatible pair (−→a , −→u ), ∆−→a (−→u ) = δ(−→a ).
However, path (a, c, d) or path (b, e) is not admissible.
−→a is simple if the ai"s are distinct.
We say that −→a is admissible if C(−→a ) is nonempty.
A path of size k is a sequence −→a = (a1, .
If C(−→a ) ∩ C(−→a ) = ∅ then δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ).
By the definition of a compatible pair, ui ∈ Dai ∩ Dai+1 for i ∈ [k − 1].
We call −→a an (a1,  ak)path.
We call −→u a (u0, uk)-sequence.
A D-sequence of order k is a sequence −→u = (u0, .
, uk) with each ui ∈ D (possibly with repetition).
