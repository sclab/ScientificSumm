Clearly we can apply the above conclusion to v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc and get a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCv w bc with −→a simple and δ(−→a ) ≤ v (b) − v (c).
To prove this, we first fix v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc and show (lemma 11) that every straight (b, c)-path compatible with some linear (v, w)-sequence has the same δ-weight ρbc(v, w).
Furthermore, for any such path −→a , δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c).
For b, c ∈ A, there is a function ρbc : Db × Dc −→ R satisfying that for any (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc , δ(−→a ) = ρbc(v, w).
We want to show that (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ).
So assume b = c. If Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, we pick an arbitrary x from this set and let −→a = (b, c) ∈ SPbc, −→u = (v, x, w) ∈ Lvw .
For a path −→a , (v, w) is compatible with −→a if there is a linear (v, w)-sequence compatible with −→a .
PATHS For v, w ∈ D we write vw for the (closed) line segment joining v and w. A D-sequence −→u of order k is linear provided that there is a sequence of real numbers 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ .
< rk−1 and the fact that these intervals cover vw implies l2 = v, rk−1 = w and for all 2 ≤ i ≤ k − 2, li+1 ≤ ri which further implies li < ri.
L1 = `S −→a ∈P CP(−→a ) ´ ∩ L, L2 = S −→a ∈SPbc−P CP(−→a )  ∩ L are closed by the finiteness of P. This is a contradiction, since it is well known (and easy to prove) that a line segment can not be expressed as the disjoint union of two nonempty closed sets.
For each n ∈ N, since (vn , wn ) ∈ CP(−→a ), there is a linear (vn , wn )-sequence un compatible with −→a , i.e., there are 0 = λn 0 ≤ λn 1 ≤ .
To do this we construct a linear (v, w)-sequence −→u and paths −→a ∗ , −→a ∗∗ ∈ Pbc, both  compatible with −→u , satisfying δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ) and δ(−→a ∗∗ ) = δ(−→a ).
For any b, c ∈ A, there is a real number ρbc with the property that (1) There is at least one straight (b, c)-path of δ-weight ρbc and (2) Every straight (b, c)-path has δ-weight ρbc. 
Finally to show δ(−→a ) ≤ v(b) − v(c), we note v(b) − v(c) = v(a1) − v(ak) = k−1X i=1 (v(ai) − v(ai+1)) and δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = v(a1) − v(a2) + k−1X i=2 (ri(ai) − ri(ai+1)).
For two outcomes d, e ∈ A, let us define fde(z) = z(d)−z(e) for all z ∈ D. It suffices to show faiai+1 (ri) ≤ faiai+1 (v) for 2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Let v = rb and w = lc.
So we can define λx for every point x on vw to be the unique number in [0, 1] such that x = (1 − λx)v + λxw.
, ut) such that −→u and −→u are both subsequences of −→u , i.e., there are indices 0 = i0 < i1 < · · · < ik = t and 0 = j0 < j1 < · · · < jl = t such that −→u = (ui0 , ui1 , .
, uk) by u0 = u1 = v, uk = w and for 2 ≤ i ≤ k−1, ui = ri.
For example, in figure 1, D-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is  linear while (v, w, u, y, z), (x, w, p, y, z), and (x, v, w, y, z) are not.
Furthermore, if x ∈ Dd and y ∈ De with x = y, then fde(x) = x(d) − x(e) ≥ δde ≥ −δed ≥ −(y(e) − y(d)) = fde(y).
For each s ∈ S, Is is maximal, i.e., not contained in any other It, for t ∈ S. In particular, the intervals {Is : s ∈ S} have all left endpoints distinct and all right endpoints distinct and the order of the left endpoints is the same as that of the right endpoints.
If b = c, singleton path −→a = (b) and D-sequence −→u = (v, w) are obviously compatible.
For b, c ∈ A and v, w ∈ D we write LCvw bc for the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Lvw .
Define the linear (v, w)-sequence −→u by uj = (1 − λj )v + λj w (j = 0, 1, .
We write CP(−→a ) for the set of pairs (v, w) compatible with −→a .
ρbc is constant on CP(−→a ) because for each (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ), ρbc(v, w) = δ(−→a ).
Hence (−→a , −→u ) is compatible, implying (v, w) ∈ CP(−→a ).
Moreover, applying the above fact with d = b, e = c, x = v and y = w, we get v(b) − v(c) ≥ v (b) − v (c) ≥ δ(−→a ).
Furthermore, as δa∗ j a∗ j+1 = δarar = 0 for each r ∈ [k], ir−1 < j < ir, δ(−→a ∗ ) = k−1X r=1 δa∗ ir a∗ ir+1 = k−1X r=1 δarar+1 = δ(−→a ).
Suppose for contradiction that there are (v, w), (v , w ) ∈ Db × Dc such that ρbc(v, w) = ρbc(v , w ).
Let Ia = Da ∩ vw for each a ∈ A.
Thus −→a is simple.
Since for each n, λn = (λn 0 , λn 1 , .
Let P = {−→a ∈ SPbc : δ(−→a ) = ρbc(v, w)}.
We now construct a (b, c)-path −→a ∗ compatible with −→u such that δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ).
We say that −→a is straight if L(−→a ) = ∅.
−→a ∗ is defined as follows: for 1 ≤ j ≤ t, a∗ j = ar where r is the unique index satisfying ir−1 < j ≤ ir.
Define the linear D-sequence −→u by u0 = v, uk = w and ui = ui for i ∈ [k − 1].
For the remaining case b = c and Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, notice v = w otherwise v = w ∈ Db ∩ Dc ∩ vw.
This completes the proof for the case that Ib = {v} and Ic = {w}.
For j > 0, each un j belongs to the closed set Daj , so uj ∈ Daj .
Since v ∈ Db, v(b) − v(c) ≥ δbc = δ(−→a ).
For a path −→a , we write L(−→a ) for the set of linear  sequences compatible with −→a .
≤ λk = 1 such that ui = (1 − λi)u0 + λiuk.
290 Next we prove that for any path −→a , CP(−→a ) is closed.
Let L1 = {(x, y) ∈ L : ρbc(x, y) = ρbc(v, w)} and L2 = L − L1.
, λn k ) belongs to the closed bounded set [0, 1]k+1 we can choose an infinite subset I ⊆ N such that the sequence (λn : n ∈ I) converges.
δ(−→a ) = 0 = v(b) − v(c).
By the convexity of D, any sequence of points on vw is a D-sequence.
Then for each j ∈ {0, .
There is a simple path −→a and D-sequence −→u such that (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
It follows immediately that (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
Define the linear D-sequence −→u = (u0, u1, .
We then show in theorem 12 that ρbc(v, w) is the same for all choices of v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc.
Similarly, for j < k each un j belongs to the closed set Daj+1 , so uj ∈ Daj+1 .
L = {((1 − λ)v + λv , (1 − λ)w + λw ) : λ ∈ [0, 1]} is a line segment in Db ×Dc by the convexity of Db, Dc.
However, path (b, a, d, e) is not straight.
It suffices to show δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ).
(An analogous construction gives −→a ∗∗ compatible with −→u such that δ(−→a ∗∗ ) = δ(−→a ).)
≤ λn k = 1 (k = |−→a |) such that un j = (1 − λn j )vn + λn j wn (j = 0, 1, .
Let ((vn , wn ) : n ∈ N) be a convergent sequence in CP(−→a ) and let (v, w) be the limit.
, k}, uj is the limit of the sequence (un j : n ∈ I).
Let |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = k and |−→a | = ord(−→u ) = l. We  select −→u to be any linear (v, w)-sequence (u0, u1, .
For v, w ∈ D we write Lvw for the set of linear (v, w)-sequences.
By lemma 8, we also haveS −→a ∈SPbc CP(−→a ) = Db ×Dc.
Since D = ∪a∈ADa, we have vw = ∪a∈AIa.
Let (−→a , −→u ), (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
For convenience, we write x ≤ y for λx ≤ λy.
(−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc is evident.
Clearly 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λk = 1.
, uik ) and −→u = (uj0 , uj1 , .
Since both uir−1 = ur−1 and uir = ur belong to Dar , uj ∈ Dar for ir−1 ≤ j ≤ ir by the convexity of Dar .
Moreover, by the convexity of Da and vw, Ia is a (possibly trivial) closed interval.
Lemma 7 implies δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ∗∗ ), which will complete the proof.
The main result of this section (theorem 12) says that for any b, c ∈ A, every straight (b, c)-path has the same δ-weight.
We begin by considering the case that Ib and Ic are each a single point, that is, Ib = {v} and Ic = {w}.
Thus for any b, c ∈ A, every straight (b, c)-path has the same  δweight.
The compatibility of (−→a ∗ , −→u ) follows immediately.
Let b, c ∈ A and v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc.
Applying this fact with d = ai, e = ai+1, x = li and y = ri gives the desired conclusion.
Neither b nor c is in S since lb = rb and lc = rc.
For any b, c ∈ A there is a straight (b,  c)path.
For d, e ∈ A, fde(z) is a linear function of z.
Clearly, a∗ 1 = a1 = b and a∗ t = ak = c, so −→a ∗ ∈ Pbc.
Again it is easy to check the compatibility of (−→a , −→u ).
Let k = |S| + 2 and index S as a2, .
Since A is finite, SPbc, the set of simple paths from b to c, is finite as well.
Clearly (v, w) ∈ L1, (v , w ) ∈ L2.
Now we define the path −→a = (a1, a2, .
Now we have Db × Dc covered by finitely many closed subsets on each of them ρbc is a constant.
Hence path (a, b, c, e) and (a, b, d, e) are both straight.
Let λ = (λ0, λ1, .
Let S be a minimal subset of A satisfying ∪s∈SIs = vw.
In particular, each ui belongs to u0uk.
Therefore fde(z) is monotonically nonincreasing along the line ←→ xy as z moves in the direction from x to y.
Denote the interval Iai by [li, ri].
For general Ib, Ic, rb < lc otherwise Db ∩ Dc ∩ vw = Ib ∩ Ic = ∅.
We are now ready for the main theorem of the section: Theorem 12. ρbc is a constant map on Db × Dc.
