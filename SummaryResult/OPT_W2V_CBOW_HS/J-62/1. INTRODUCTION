The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a  necessary condition for truthfulness.
Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical  assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer.
Gf is called the outcome graph of f. The weak monotonicity property mentioned earlier can be defined for arbitrary social choice functions by the  condition that every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle property.
The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2.
Using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains.
The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7.
For functions with unrestricted domain, i.e., whose domain is the set of all real matrices, there are very good characterizations of truthfulness.
Each of these  examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all  social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers.
Both hypotheses are needed to show: (1) the existence of a straight path from a to b for all a, b (lemma 8).
An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice  function with a payment function, which assigns to each player a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the individual preferences.
Associated to any single player function f with domain D we define an edge-weighted directed graph Hf whose vertex set is the image of f. For convenience, we assume that f is surjective and so this image is A.
As is required by proposition 2, each function in the set is local.
For any surjective single player function f : D −→ A where D is a convex subset of RA and A is finite, the nonnegative two-cycle property implies the nonnegative cycle property.
The finite range hypothesis is also needed to reduce theorem 4 to the case that D is closed (section 2) and to prove that every straight path from a to b has the same δ-weight (theorem 12). 
A function g is a subfunction of function f, or f contains g, if g is obtained by restricting the domain of f. A property P of functions is hereditary if it is preserved under taking subfunctions.
The domain constraints considered in both papers are special cases of linear inequality constraints, and it is natural to ask whether W-MON is sufficient for any domain defined by such constraints.
For a player i, a set of valuation matrices is said to be i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for row i.
It is easy to see that Hf has the nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle property if and only if Gf does.
In section 3, for each a ∈ A, we enlarge the set f−1 (a) to a closed convex set Da ⊆ D in such a way that for a, b ∈ A with a = b, Da and Db have disjoint interiors.
A mechanism is truthful (or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if each player"s best strategy, knowing the preferences of the others, is always to declare his own true preferences.
We define an admissible path to be a sequence of outcomes (a1, .
For example, an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row, a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry, and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0.
Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains.
Therefore, to get a set of obstructions for truthfulness, it suffices to obtain such a set for local functions.
286 family has the property, and that every function with the property is in the family.
A local social choice function is truthful if and only if it has the nonnegative cycle property.
In this paper we assume that the range A is finite and that each player"s preference is expressed by a valuation function which  assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing the benefit the player derives from that outcome.
As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal non-truthful functions, this provides the optimal obstruction characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of all social choice functions.
A third notion applies in the case of hereditary properties of functions.
But by restricting attention to  interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class.
We say that f satisfies: • the nonnegative cycle property if every directed cycle has nonnegative weight.
We define Gf to be the  edgeweighted directed graph with exactly one edge from a to b, whose weight δab is the infimum (possibly −∞) of all of the edge weights ex(a, b) for x ∈ f−1 (a).
We prove that for any two outcomes a, b, there is a straight path from a to b (lemma 8 and corollary 10), and all straight paths from a to b have the same weight, which we denote ρab (theorem 12).
The domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that are fixed on all rows but row i.
The convex domain hypothesis is also needed for the convexity of the sets Da (section 3).
Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for  truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property.
1.3 Overview of the Proof of Theorem 4 Let D ⊆ RA be convex and let f : D −→ A be a single player function such that Gf has no negative two-cycles.
To expand on the above summary, we give the definitions of an admissible path and a straight path.
This question is of the following general type: given a class of functions (here, social choice functions) and a  property that holds for some of them (here, truthfulness),  characterize the property.
This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness.
It turns out that the  domain of the function, i.e., the set of allowed valuation  matrices, is crucial.
Thus a social choice function is truthful if and only if every local  subfunction satisfies the nonnegative cycle property.
Since each player seeks to maximize his own benefit, he may find it in his interest to misrepresent his valuation function.
Finally, we mention how the hypotheses of convex domain and finite range are used in the proof.
We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms for the property of truthfulness, but there are significant  results concerning parametric representations and obstruction characterizations of truthfulness.
Social choice theory centers around the general problem of selecting a single outcome out of a set A of alternative  outcomes based on the individual preferences of a set P of  players.
The key step to this proof is showing that the ρ-weight of every directed triangle is 0 (lemma 17).
• the nonnegative two-cycle property if every directed  cycle between two vertices has nonnegative weight.
In particular its domain has size at most the number of possible outcomes |A|.
Since f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from D, we can view f as a function from D to A.
A set of obstructions is complete if every function that does not have the property contains one of them as a subfunction.
Thus the results of Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain subclasses of social choice functions.
287 1.2 Weak Monotonicity and the Nonnegative Cycle Property By proposition 2, a function is truthful if and only if each of its local subfunctions is truthful.
Therefore, f is a social choice function having one player; we refer to such a function as a single player function.
For two vertices a, b, let δ∗ ab denote the minimum weight of any path from a to b.
These are  somewhat technical and rely on the geometry of f. We first observe that, without loss of generality, we can assume that D is (topologically) closed (section 2).
For a hereditary property P, a function g that does not have the property is an  obstruction to the property in the sense that any function containing g doesn"t have the property.
Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain,  every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain.
(Independently, in the context of multi-unit  auctions, Bikhchandani, Chatterji and Sen [3] identified the same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal  utilities (NDMU).)
It turns out that ρ is equal to δ∗ (corollary 20), although this equality is not needed in the proof of theorem 4.
This condition can be viewed as providing a  minimal complete set of non-truthful functions.
The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.
Fix such a function f and let D ⊆ RA be the set of allowed choices for row i.
An  admissible path is straight if there is a straight line that meets one point from each of the sets I1, .
The weight of a set of edges is just the sum of the weights of the edges.
For each a, b ∈ A, x ∈ f−1 (a) there is an edge ex(a, b) from a to b with weight x(a) − x(b).
For any social choice function having  convex domain and finite range, weak monotonicity is necessary and sufficient for truthfulness.
We say a local function g satisfies nonnegative cycle  property/nonnegative two-cycle property if its associated single player function f does.
The set of all functions that don"t satisfy P is a complete (but trivial and uninteresting) set of obstructions; one seeks a set of small (ideally, minimal) obstructions.
Our proof shows that the δ∗ -weight of every cycle is exactly 0, from which theorem 4 follows.
Give an algorithm which, given an appropriate representation of a function in the class, determines whether the function has the property.
This is the result we will prove.
The ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a  valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by outcomes.
There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations,  although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed.
Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is  ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i.
, ak) such that each of the sets Ij = Daj ∩ Daj+1 is nonempty (section 4).
We show that ρab ≤ δab (lemma 14) and that the ρ-weight of every cycle is 0.
The definition of the property itself provides a characterization, so what more is needed?
A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to  implement the social choice function.
There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]).
A  social choice function is truthfully implementable, or truthful if it has a truthful implementation.
A major difficulty connected with social choice functions is that players can not be required to tell the truth about their preferences.
An obstruction is minimal if every proper subfunction has the  property.
The graph Hf has a possibly infinite number of edges between any two vertices.
For general domains, however, the picture is far from complete.
Give an explicit parametrized family of functions and show that each function in the 1 The usual definition of mechanism is more general than this (see [8] Chapter 23.C or [9]); the mechanisms we consider here are usually called direct revelation mechanisms.
• Sets of obstructions.
Based on geometric considerations, we identify a subset of paths in Gf called admissible paths and a subset of admissible paths called straight paths.
This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful functions, but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions.
By carefully choosing the payment function, one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth.
Truthfulness is easily seen to be hereditary.
1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of  truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.
This framework leads naturally to the question: which social choice functions are truthful?
Theorem 1  extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions.
A method for aggregating player preferences to select one outcome is called a social choice function.
The following easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature: Proposition 2.

Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] conjectured that W-MON suffices for convex domains.
Building on work of Roberts [10], Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] defined a condition called weak monotonicity  (WMON).
(The property of  truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility).
(2) that the ρ-weight of a directed triangle is 0 (lemma 17).
Here are some useful notions of characterization: • Recognition algorithm.
These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries.
There seems to be no direct way to compute δ∗ and so we proceed indirectly.
The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to this conjecture: Theorem 1.
We want to conclude that Gf has no negative cycles.
In light of this, theorem 1 follows from: Theorem 4.
Furthermore it is one-to-one.
The following result was obtained by Rochet [11] in a slightly different form and rediscovered by Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5]: Lemma 3.
