It is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set D of real  matrices is a WM-domain.
Let us say that a set D of P × A real valuation matrices is a WM-domain if any social choice function on D  satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful.
What are the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is an AM-domain?
Turning to parametric representations, let us say a set D of P × A matrices is an AM-domain if any truthful  social choice function with domain D is an affine maximizer.
In this paper, we showed that for finite A, any convex D is a WM-domain.
We believe that convexity is the main part of the story, i.e., a WM-domain is, after excluding some exceptional cases, essentially a convex set.
Typically, the domains of social choice functions considered in  mechanism design are convex, but there are interesting examples with non-convex domains, e.g., combinatorial auctions with unknown single-minded bidders.
Roberts" theorem says that the unrestricted domain is an AM-domain.
As stated in the introduction, the goal underlying the work in this paper is to obtain useful and general  characterizations of truthfulness.
