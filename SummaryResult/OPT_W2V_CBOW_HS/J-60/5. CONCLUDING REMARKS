However, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs.
Incentives for  information propagation should be considered as well (e.g., for P2P networks for file sharing).
In this paper we have seen a new partial informational assumption, and we have demonstrated its suitability to networks in which computational agents can easily collect and distribute information.
As a result, the probability that the environment is informed decreases, and  selfish agents would not cooperate.
The challenge is to find more realistic scenarios in which the partial informational  assumption is applicable.
It would be interesting to identify these cases.
Some issues for future work include: • As we have seen, the implementation issue in p-informed environments is straightforward - it is easy to construct incentive compatible mechanisms even for  non-singleparameter cases.
In our examples we choose p such that the maintenance cost over time is negligible.
We then described some  mechanisms using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
• It seems that some social choice goals cannot be  implemented if each player is at least 1/n-malicious (where n is the number of players).
• Mechanisms for information propagation and  maintenance.
