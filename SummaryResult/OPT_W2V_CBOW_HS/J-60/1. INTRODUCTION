We demonstrate this concept through some motivating examples that (i) seem natural in distributed settings and (ii) cannot be implemented in dominant  strategies even if there is an authorized center with a direct  connection to every agent or even if players have single-parameter domains.
1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.
The SPE-implementability concept seems natural for the following reasons: the designed mechanisms usually have non-artificial constructs and a small strategy space.
In particular, the subfield of Mechanism Design deals with the construction of mechanisms: for a given social goal the challenge is to design rules for interaction such that selfish behavior of the agents will result in the desired social goal [23, 33].
We show a simple  decentralized mechanism in which q-malicious players cooperate and in particular, do not use their punishing actions in  equilibrium.
241 1.3 Dominant Strategy Implementations In this subsection we shall refer to some recent results demonstrating that the set-up of private information with the concept of dominant strategies is restrictive in general.
And so it is seems natural to consider environments in which the  information is locally recorded, that is, the information is recorded in the closest neighborhood with some probability p. In this paper we shall see that if the information is  available with some probability, then this enables us to  implement a wider range of social goals.
In most distributed environments, players can take  advantage of the network structure to collect and distribute information about other players.
Naturally, the study of such giant decentralized systems involves aspects of game theory [32, 34].
Recently [20] extends Roberts" result to some leading examples.
The solution concept of dominant strategies - in which each player has a best response strategy regardless of the strategy played by any other player - is well suited to the assumption of private information, in which each player is not assumed to have knowledge or beliefs regarding the other players.
Finally, Moore and Repullo observed that they actually use a  relaxed complete information assumption: it is only required that for every player there exists only one other player who is informed about him.
First, Roberts" classical impossibility result shows that if players" preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy  mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35].
A P2P network is a  distributed network with no centralized authority, in which the participants share their individual resources (e.g.,  processing power, storage capacity, bandwidth and content).
Several recent papers consider relaxations of the dominant strategy concept: [32, 1, 2, 19, 16, 17, 26, 21].
The emergence of popular scalable shared networks with self-interested entities - such as peer-to-peer systems over the Internet and mobile wireless communication ad-hoc  networks - poses fundamental challenges.
In addition, they can distribute this information.
To date, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms are the only known general method for designing dominant  strategy mechanisms for general domains of preferences.
We first show how the subgame perfect techniques of Moore and Repullo [28] can be applied to p-informed environments and further adjusted to the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies (for large enough p).
However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).
As a case study we apply our methods to derive: (1)  Simplified Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing with no  payments in equilibrium.
More formally, we say that agent B is p-informed about agent A, if B knows the type of A with probability p. For such partially-informed environments, we show how to use the solution concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
In this simple game, the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain known sum of money, and the responder either agrees or refuses, in the latter case both players earn zero.
Distributed  Algorithmic Mechanism Design (DAMD) studies mechanism design in inherently decentralized settings [30, 12].
As a result, cooperation is achieved independent of agents" belief.
This was observed and analyzed in [32, 22, 31].
Third, the constructed mechanisms are often  decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their  subgame perfect strategies.
This paper thus studies the effects of relaxing the private information assumption.
Additionally, for some domains of preferences, VCG mechanisms and weighted VCG mechanisms are faced with  computational hardness [22, 20].
One such widely studied case is the Ultimatum Bargaining 2-person game.
Organization of this paper: In section 2 we illustrate the concepts of subgame perfect and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies in completely-informed and partially-informed environments.
Second, as agents dynamically enter and exit from the network, the information might not be always available.
240 One model that has been extensively studied recently is the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network.
As a result, it is straightforward for a player to compute his strategy.1 Second, sequential mechanisms avoid  simultaneous moves, and thus can be considered for distributed networks.
In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability.
Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often  rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g.
This demonstrates that in some computational contexts our approach is far less demanding than the Bayesian approach (that assumes that players" types are drawn according to some identified  probability density function).
Many mechanisms have been constructed using this set-up, e.g., [1, 4, 6, 11, 14, 22].
The concept they used is subgame-perfect  implementations (SPE).
Most of these apply to severely-restricted cases (e.g., single-item auctions with no externalities) in which a player"s  preference is described by only one parameter (single-parameter domains).
1.1 Implementations in Complete Information Set-ups In complete information environments, each agent is  informed about everyone else.
We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed  environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p âˆˆ (0, 1]).
Algorithmic Mechanism Design (AMD) focuses on  efficiently computable constructions [32].
Our approach is similar to [7] (and the references therein), who considered independently such players in different context.
For slightly-restricted preference domains, it is not known how to turn efficiently computable algorithms into dominant strategy mechanisms.
However, no outsider can observe this information.
We suggest a quantified notion of malicious player, who benefits from his own gained surplus and from harm caused to others.
Moore and Repullo implement a large class of social goals using sequential mechanisms with a small number of rounds [28].
Recent work on P2P Incentives include  micropayment methods [15] and reputation-based methods [9, 13].
The following description of a P2P network scenario  illustrates the relevance of our relaxed informational assumption.
They showed that under mild assumptions any dominant  strategy mechanism for variety of Combinatorial Auctions over multi-dimensional domains must be almost weighted VCG.
Recently, global networks have attracted widespread study.
As a result, malicious players might cause severe harm to others.
We consider implementations in various network  structures.
The appropriateness of this set-up stems from the strength of the solution concept, which complements the weak information assumption.
Our mechanisms use reasonable punishments that inversely depend on p. And so, if the fines are large then small p is enough to induce cooperation.
This condition is very restrictive, as many desired natural goals are non-monotone2 .
Many  positive results were shown for such arguably realistic settings.
Additionally, it turns out that the dominant strategy  requirement implies that the social goal must be monotone [35, 36, 22, 20, 5, 37].
This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.
However, in distributed settings without available subsidies from outside sources, VCG mechanisms cannot be accepted as valid solutions due to a serious lack of budget balance.
Specifically, neither the mechanism designer nor the court.
In section 3 we show a mechanism for Peer-to-Peer file sharing networks.
The standard model assumes rational agents with quasi-linear utilities and private information, playing dominant strategies.
That is, each agent observes his own preference and the preferences of all other agents.
Recently, [8, 3] considered implementations for generalized single-parameter players.
However, it is impossible to record all the information  everywhere.
1.2.1 Malicious Agents Decentralized mechanisms often utilize punishing outcomes.
In section 4 we apply our methods to derive a web cache mechanism.
Our approach is (agent, file)-specific.
(2) Web-cache budget-balanced and economically efficient mechanism.
For recent surveys see [25, 27, 18].
Further limitations of the set-up are discussed in subsection 1.3.
Whenever agent B uploads a file from agent A, all peers along the routing path know that B has loaded the file.
The most popular P2P networks are those for sharing media files, such as Napster, Gnutella, and Kazaa.
Consider a Peer-to-Peer network for file  sharing.
They can record this information about agent B.
Essentially, large p implies a large amount of recorded information.
Future work is briefly discussed in section 5. 
and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).
[12] suggests several categories to classify non-cooperating players.
The aggregation of such resources provides inexpensive  computational platforms.
First, such duplication induces huge costs.
