If Alice misreports LA > LT A, then Bob can ensure himself the bonus (which is always strictly preferable than reaching Stage 3) by challenging with LA = LT A, and so whenever Bob gets the bonus Alice gains the worst of all payoffs.
Then by the  Revelation Principle [23] there exists a mechanism that implements this goal for which the dominant strategy of each player is to report his true load.
The strategy of each player is to report the true load and to challenge with the true load if the other agent overreport.
2.2.1 Trade Mechanism for Malicious Agents The buyer might maliciously punish the seller by  choosing the outcome (b) when the true state is H. The following notion quantifies the consideration that a player is not  indifferent to the private surpluses of others.
Such buyer"s threat is not credible, because if the mechanism is played only once, and Stage 2 is reached in state H, the buyer would strictly decrease his payoff if he chooses (b).
Otherwise, if Bob challenges, Alice would always strictly prefer to transfer (as in this case Bob would perform her load for smaller cost), as a result Bob would pay T + to the  mechanism.
In particular, even if the agent reports a lower load.
The unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the trade mechanism is to report the true state in Stage 1 and trading if Stage 2 is reached.
Now we shall see that overreporting her value is a dominated strategy, as well.
The goal is to sell the item for the average low price pl = ls+lb 2 in state L, and the higher price ph = hs+hb 2 in the other state H, where ls is seller"s cost and lb is buyer"s value in state L, and similarly hs, hb in H. The players fix the prices without knowing what will be the future state.
As in [28], we need the capability to judge between two distinct declarations in the elicitation rounds, 6 A strategy si of player i is weakly dominated if there exists si such that (i) the payoff gained by si is at least as high as the payoff gained by si, for all strategies of the other players and all preferences, and (ii) there exist a preference and a combination of strategies for the other players such that the payoff gained by si is strictly higher than the payoff gained by si.
LT A < LT B < LT A + t. If stage 2 is reached Bob will exchange, and this is what Alice prefers.
Note that the basic mechanism does not use monetary transfers at all and is decentralized in the sense that no third party is needed to run the procedure.
The cost performing a load of duration d is exactly d. We assume that the duration t of the new task is < T. The payoffs 4 proof: Assume that there exists a mechanism that  implements this goal in dominant strategies.
First  observe that underreporting the true value is a dominated strategy, whether Bob is not informed and mistakenly challenges with a lower load (as βp ≥ L) or not, or even if t is very small.
If all agents are p-informed, p > 0.5, the elicitation mechanism(βp) implements the fair  assignment goal with the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
2.2 Seller and Buyer Scenario A player might cause severe harm to others by choosing a non-equilibrium outcome.
That is, the seller chooses to trade at low price at either states, and the buyer always chooses the no trade option that fines the seller, if the second stage is reached.
Suppose there is equilibrium entry for the state L. The associate column must be all pl,  otherwise the seller would have an incentive to deviate.
2.1.2 Elicitation Mechanism In this subsection we shall see a centralized mechanism for the fair assignment goal without load exchange in  equilibrium.
Although each extensive game-form is strategically equivalent to a normal form one, the extensive form representation places more structure and so it seems plausible that the subgame perfect equilibrium will be played.9 7 Formally, this goal is not Maskin monotonic, a necessary condition for Nash-implementability [24].
Consider a matrix representation, where the seller is the row player and the buyer is the column player, in which every  entry includes an outcome.
A player is q-malicious if his payoff equals: (1 − q) (his private surplus) − q (summation of others surpluses), q ∈ [0, 1].
Alice pays to the mechanism.
The informational assumption is that Alice and Bob know both loads and the duration of the new task.3 2 E.g., minimizing the makespan within a factor of 2 [32] and Rawls" Rule over some multi-dimensional domains [20].
Design a decentralized budget balanced mechanism with reasonable fines for independently p-informed n players, where p ≤ 1 − 1/2 1 n−1 .
Alice"s expected payoff gained by misreporting ≤ p (payoff if she lies and Bob is informed) +(1 − p) (max payoff if Bob is not informed) ≤ p (−t − βp) < p (−t) + (1 − p) (−t − βp) ≤ p (min payoff of true report if Bob is informed) + (1 − p) (min payoff if Bob is not informed) ≤ Alice"s expected payoff if she truly reports.
Otherwise, trade at the low price pl.
In state H, the q-malicious buyer would prefer to trade if (1 − q)(hb − ph) + q(hs − ph) > (1 − q)∆ + q(∆).
It is a subgame perfect equilibrium of the elicitation mechanism to report the true load, and to  challenge with the true load only if the other agent overreports.
Observe that the elicitation mechanism is almost balanced: in all outcomes no money comes in or out, except for the non-equilibrium outcome (a), in which both players pay to the mechanism.
Equilibria outcomes remain unchanged, and so cooperation is achieved as in the original case of non-malicious players.
Intuitively this means that in equilibrium each player will choose his best action at each point he might reach, assuming similar behavior of others, and thus every SPE is a Nash equilibrium.
Thus such misreporting can only increase the possibility that she is assigned the task.
In the right hand side, if he is informed, then challenging is a dominated strategy, and if he is not informed the worst harm he can make is to challenge.
We shall see that the traders would avoid such bad behavior if they are q-malicious, where q < 0.5, that is if their non-indifference impact is bounded by 0.5.
In this case, Bob would strictly prefer to agree (and not to announce LA < LA, as he limited to challenge with a smaller load than what she announces).
This implies that challenging without being informed is a dominated strategy for Bob.
This is captured by outcome (b) in the trade mechanism.
Similarly, the associate row of the H equilibrium entry must be all ph (otherwise the buyer would deviate), a contradiction.
• Stage 2: The buyer has to choose between: - (a) Trade at the high price ph.
It turns out that a version of the elicitation mechanism works for this relaxed information assumption, if we use the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated  strategies6 .
The fair assignment goal cannot be implemented in dominant strategies.4 2.1.1 Basic Mechanism The following simple mechanism implements this goal in subgame perfect equilibrium.
The additional assumptions are as follows.
An agent A is p-informed about agent B, if A knows the type of B with probability p (independently of what B knows).
We replace the fixed fine of in the elicitation  mechanism with the fine: βp = max{L, 1 − p 2p − 1 T} + , and assume the bounds LT A, LT B ≤ L. Proposition 2.
Bob knows the maximum payoff he can gain is at most zero since he cannot expect to get the bonus in the next stage.
5 In [28], if an agent misreport his type then it is always beneficial to the other agent to challenge.
If stage 2 is reached then Bob would exchange, as a result it is strictly preferable by Alice to perform the task.
Note that the outcome (b) is never chosen in equilibrium.
Reporting a lower load LA < LT A is not beneficial for Alice.
Hence reporting preferences over outcomes is not enough - players must supply  additional information.
Assume that ls < hs < lb < hb, and that trade can occur in both prices (that is, pl, ph ∈ (hs, lb)).
Note that pl < ph for q < 0.5.
7 8 The buyer prefers pl and seller ph, and so the preferences are identical in both states.
Trivially, the seller prefers to trade at the higher price, (1 − q)(pl − hs) + q(pl − hb) < (1 − q)(ph − hs) + q(ph − hb).
In addition, for p-informed  environments, some structure is needed to ensure that  underbidding is a dominated strategy.
In this section we examine the concepts of subgame perfect and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies for completely informed and p-informed environments.
Clearly, truthfully reporting cannot be a dominant strategy for this goal (if monetary transfers are not available), as players would prefer to report higher loads.
Consider the following decentralized trade mechanism.
Assume w.l.o.g that the elicitation of Alice"s load is done after Bob"s, and that Stage 2 is reached.
We shall see that the bonus of is paid to a challenging player only in out of equilibria cases.
The Choregia-type mechanisms can be applied to more than 2 players with the same number of stages: the player in the first stage can simply points out the name of the  wealthiest agent.
The term (−t−βp) in the left hand side is due to the fact that if Bob is informed he will always prefer to challenge.
She then has to choose between: - (a) Transferring her original load to Bob and  paying him LA − 0.5 · min{ , LA − LA}.
If Alice truly reports LA = LT A, Bob strictly prefers to agree.
2.2.2 Discussion No mechanism can Nash-implement this trading goal if the only possible outcomes are trade at pl and trade at ph.
These mechanisms can be budget-balanced, as some player might replace the role of the designer, and collect the fines, as observed in [28].
Assume w.l.o.g that the elicitation of Alice"s load is done after Bob"s, and that Stage 2 is reached.
The seller prefers to trade at a low price, as (1 − q)(pl − ls) + q(pl − lb) > 0 > −∆.
In the mechanism for the fair  assignment goal, an agent might maliciously challenge even if the other agent truly reports his load.
Intuitively, if a goal is not Nash-implementable we need to add more outcomes.
We demonstrate that equilibria remain unchanged even if players are malicious.
Bob pays the fine of T + to the mechanism.
E.g., additional Nash equilibrium for the trade mechanism is (trade at pl, (b)).
Let LT A, LT B be the true loads of Alice and Bob, and let t > 0 be the load of the new task.
All together, Alice would prefer to report the truth in this stage.
And so there is no incentive for Alice to do so.
9 Interestingly, it is a straight forward to construct a  sequential mechanism with unique SPE, and additional NE with a strictly larger payoff for every player.
However, in the second case exchange do occur in an equilibrium point.
In this subsection we consider such malicious scenarios.
2.1.3 Elicitation Mechanism for Partially Informed Agents In this subsection we consider partially informed agents.
This argument can be reasoned also for the first stage, when Bob reports his value.
3 In first glance one might ask why the completely informed agents could not simply sign a contract, specifying the  desired goal.
Their goal is to assign the task to the least loaded worker without any monetary transfers.
In state L the buyer prefers the no trade outcome, as (1−q)(lb −ph)+q(ls −ph) < ∆.
Only the players can observe the realization of the true state.
2.1.4 Extensions The elicitation mechanism for partially informed agents is rather general.
Thus in stage 2 Alice will report her true load.
If q < 0.5, then the unique subgame perfect equilibrium for q-malicious players remains unchanged.
Consider the trade mechanism with pl = (1 − q) hs + q lb , ph = q hs + (1 − q) lb , ∆ = (1 − q) (hb − lb − ).
Indeed, (1 − q)hb + qhs > ∆ + ph.
In the seller-buyer example there is one item to be traded and two possible future states.
Alice pays to Bob.
If the mechanism stops at Stage 3, then the payoff of each agent is at least −t and at most 0.
The  following mechanism is an adaptation of Moore and Repullo"s elicitation mechanism [28]5 .
Observe that Alice is assigned the task and fined with whenever Bob challenges.
We shall see that the basic mechanism achieves the goal in a subgame perfect equilibrium.
Such a contract is sometimes infeasible due to fact that the true state cannot be observed by outsiders, especially not the court.
- (b) No trade and seller pays ∆ to the buyer.
This punishing outcome is less preferable than the normal outcome of Stage 3 achieved had he agreed.
By backward induction argument (look forward and reason backward), consider the following cases: 1.
242 of the utility maximizers agents are quasilinear.
Similarly, the elicitation mechanisms can be  extended in a straightforward manner.
To see this, it is enough to consider normal forms (as any  extensive form mechanism can be presented as a normal one).
The payoffs are of the form ub = xv−tb, us = ts −xvs, where the binary variable x indicates if trade occurred, and tb, ts are the transfers.
If stage 2 is reached then Bob will not exchange.
By backward induction we consider two cases.
The drawback is that some new additional equilibria must be ruled out.
• Stage 3: If LA < LB Alice is assigned the task, otherwise Bob.
([27]) The task is assigned to the least loaded worker in subgame perfect equilibrium.
2.1 The Fair Assignment Problem Our first example is an adjustment to computerized  context of an ancient procedure to ensure that the wealthiest man in Athens would sponsor a theatrical production known as the Choregia [27].
Recall the unrealistic assumption that load exchange takes zero time and cost.
• Stage 2: The elicitation of Bob"s load is similar to Stage 1 (switching the roles of Alice and Bob).
We also present the notion of q-maliciousness and some other related considerations through two illustrative examples.
- (b) Exchanging his load with Alice and  performing the new task as well.
Clearly, this is not a subgame perfect equilibrium.
• Stage 2: If she refuses, Bob has to choose between: - (a) Performing the task himself.
For the ease of  exposition we present a second example.
243 and upper and lower bounds based on the possible payoffs derived from the last stage.
Assume that load  exchanging takes zero time and cost.
Claim 2.
In the fair assignment problem, Alice and Bob are two workers, and there is a new task to be  performed.
And so Stage 2 would not abnormally end by STOP, and similarly Stage 1.
The goal is achieved in equilibrium (ties are broken in favor of Alice).
Claim 1.
If LA = LA (Bob agrees) goto the next Stage.
• Stage 1: If seller reports H goto Stage 2.
- (b) No load transfer.
• Stage 1: (Elicitation of Alice"s load) Alice announces LA.
Claim 3.
Otherwise (Bob challenges), Alice is assigned the task.
Bob announces LA ≤ LA.
8 A similar argument applies for the Fair Assignment  Problem.
Claim 5.
• Stage 1: Alice either agrees to perform the new task or refuses.
Claim 4.
Introducing fines, the next mechanism overcomes this drawback.
LT B ≤ LT A.
This definition appeared independently in [7] in different context.
LT A + t ≤ LT B.
Let ∆ = lb−ph+ .
