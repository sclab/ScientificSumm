The selective-sharing mechanism presented in this paper does not make any assumptions about the format of the data used or about the structure of the distribution function of the parameter to be estimated.
Furthermore, most of the improvement is achieved in initial  interactions, which is of great importance for agents operating in fast-paced environments.
Selective-sharing allows an agent to benefit from other agents" observations in scenarios in which data sources of the same type are available.
The Wilcoxon statistic used as described in this paper to provide a classifier for similarity between users provides high flexibility with low computational costs and is applicable for any  characteristic being learned.
It also guarantees, as a fallback, performance equivalent to that of a self-learner when the information source is unique.
The results of our simulations demonstrate the selective-sharing mechanism"s effectiveness in improving the estimation produced for probabilistic parameters based on a limited set of observations.
Furthermore, selective-sharing does not require any prior knowledge about the types of information sources available in the environment or of the number of agents associated with each type.
Its use provides a good measure of similarity which an agent can use to decide how much external information to adopt for its assessments. 
Evidence for its general effectiveness is given in the general evaluation section, where environments were continuously randomly generated.
Although we tested the selective-sharing mechanism in the context of the Coordinators project, it is  applicable in any MAS environment having the characteristics of a fast-paced environment (e.g., rescue environments).
It is computationally lightweight and very simple to execute.
