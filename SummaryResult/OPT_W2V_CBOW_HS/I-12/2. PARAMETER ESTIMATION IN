Figure 1: The distribution structure affecting the expected cost"s calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having  Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs (e.g., will know at a specific interruption time, with some level of reliability, the actual outcome of a task currently being executed) is to rely on prior interactions with this user,  calculating the ratio between the number of times the user had the information and the total number of interactions.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The more observations an agent can accumulate about the  distribution of the frequency of an owner"s interaction with the  environment at a given time, the better it can estimate the probability the owner has the information needed by the system. 
This paper focuses on the twin problems of estimating the parameters P and C, both of which are user-centric in the sense of being  determined by characteristics of the owner and the environment in which the owner is operating); it presumes a mechanism for determining V [18].
Thus, owners" levels of communication with others, which can be obtained without interrupting them, provide some indication of the frequency with which they obtain new information.
Although this prior work uses interruptibility estimates to  balance the interaction"s estimated importance against the degree of distraction likely to be caused, it differs from the fast-paced  environments problem we address in three ways that fundamentally change the nature of the problem and hence alter the possible  solutions.
As a result, the CA must estimate the expected benefit of any such interaction and the cost associated with it [19].
Methods that depend on predicting what a person will do next based only on what the user is currently doing (e.g., MDPs) are not appropriate for modeling focus of attention in fast-paced domains, because an agent cannot rely on a person"s attentional state being well structured and monitoring can only be done on a sporadic, non-continuous basis.
For instance, in  Coordinatorslike scenarios, owners may obtain a variety of information through occasional coordination meetings of all owners, direct  communication with other individual owners participating in the execution of a joint task (through which they may learn informally about the existence or status of other actions they are executing), open  communications they overhear (e.g.
The second, the integral divided by F(xrv), represents the expected cost of  interruption, because the expected number of search cycles is  (random) geometric and the probability of success is F(xrv).
In this  domain, autonomous agents, called Coordinators, are intended to help maximize an overall team objective by handling changes in the task schedule as conditions of operation change.
Denoting the  probability distribution function of the amount of communication the user generally maintains with its environment by g(x), and using the transformation function Z(x), mapping from a level of  communication, x, to a probability of having the information, the expected probability of getting the information that is needed from the owner when interrupting at a given time can be calculated from P = Z ∞ 0 Z(x)g(x)dy.
In this domain, scheduling information and constraints are distributed.
Taking the derivative of the left-hand-side of Equation 1 and equating it to zero, yields the characteristics of the optimal reservation value, namely x∗ rv must satisfy, V (x∗ rv) = x∗ rv.
Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owner"s interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.
Alternatively, the agent can attempt to infer this probability from measurable  characteristics of the user"s behavior, which it can assess without  requiring an interruption.
The CA"s cost estimation uses a mechanism that integrates the distribution of an owner"s  interruptibility level (as estimated by the CA) into an economic search strategy, in a way that the overall combined cost of sensor costs and interaction costs is minimized.
Thus, when we consider sharing data, it is not necessary to rely on complete similarity in the distribution function of different users.
Thus, the actual tasks being scheduled are executed either by  owners or by units they oversee, and the agent"s responsibility is limited to maintaining the scheduling of these tasks and coordinating with the agents of other human team members (i.e., other owners).
However, in contrast to prior work, which relies on these devices operating continuously, our  mechanism presumes that fast-paced environments only allow for the activation of sensors for short periods of time on an ad-hoc basis, because agents" resources are severely limited.
Schedule revisions that affect more than one agent must be coordinated, so agents thus must share certain kinds of  information.
The mechanisms described in this paper also presume the existence of such sensors.
The agent-owner relationship is a collaborative one, with the agent needing to interact with its owner to obtain task and  environment information relevant to scheduling.
Thus, at any given time, the cost of  interaction with the user is essentially probabilistic, as reflected over a single random monitoring event, and can be assigned a probability distribution function.
c = Z x∗ rv y=0 F(y) (3) This method, which depends on extracting the optimal sequence of sensor-based user sampling, relies heavily on the structure of the distribution function, f(x).
The search process itself is associated with a cost, and opportunities (in our case, interruption opportunities) are associated with a stationary distribution function.
Work which examines such interruptibility-cost factors as user frustration and  distractability [10] includes work on the cost of repeatedly bothering the user which takes into account the fact that recent interruptions and  difficult questions should carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past or straightforward questions [5].
By using sensors to provide continuous incoming indications of the user"s attentional state, these models attempt to provide a means for computing probability distributions over a user"s attention and intentions [9].
In general, the net benefit of a potential interaction is PV − C, where V is the value of the information the user may have, P is the probability that the user has this  information, and C is the cost associated with an interaction.
(2) Substituting (2) in Equation 1 yields Equation 3 (after integration by parts) from which the optimal reservation value, x∗ rv, and  consequently (from Equation 2) V (x∗ rv) can be computed.
Each agent operates on behalf of its owner (e.g., the team leader of a  firstresponse team or a unit commander) whose schedule it manages.
FASTPACED DOMAINS The CA module and algorithms we describe in this paper were developed and tested in the Coordinators domain [21].
Each agent receives a different view of the tasks and structures that constitute the full multi-agent problem-typically only a partial, local one.
Given occasional updates about its owner"s level of communication, the CA can estimate the probability that a random interaction with the owner will yield the information it needs.
Prior work has tracked users" focus of attention using a range of devices, including those able to monitor gestures [8] and track  eyegaze to identify focus of visual attention [13, 20], thus enabling  estimations of cognitive load and physical indicators of performance degradation.
The values of P, V , and C are time-varying, and the CA estimates their value at the intended time of initiating the interaction with its owner.
However, we need only a portion of the distribution function, namely from the origin to the reservation value.
For some parameters, including the user"s interruptibility level, it is enough to rely on similarity in the relevant portion of the distribution function.
The first part, c divided by F(xrv), represents the expected sampling cost.
if commanders leave their radios open, they can listen to messages associated with other teams in their area), and other formal or informal communication channels [24].
Second, the interruptibility-estimation models are task-based.
As a result, it is difficult to determine the actual  attentional state of agent-owners [15].
First, it considers settings in which the computer system has information that may be relevant to its user rather than the user (owner) having information needed by the system, which is the complement of the information exchange situation we consider.
The agent can activate sensing devices to get an estimation of the interruption cost, x, at the current time, but there is a cost c of  operating the sensing devices for a single time unit.
The expected cost, V (xrv), using such a strategy with  reservation value xrv is described by Equation 1, V (xrv) = c + R xrv y=0 yf(y) F(xrv) , (1) which decomposes into two parts.
However, the fast-paced nature of the domain constrains the amount of information they can share, precluding a centralized solution; scheduling problems must be solved distributively.
The CA module is  responsible for deciding intelligently when and how to interact with the owner for improving the agent"s scheduling.
In particular, we consider the situation in which an agent"s owner has an interruption cost described by a probability distribution  function (pdf) f(x) and a cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x).
It typically uses Bayesian models to learn a user"s current or likely future focus of attention from an ongoing stream of actions.
In such settings, owners must make complex decisions that typically involve a number of other members of their units, while remaining reactive to events that  diverge from expectations [24].
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 203 retract and re-plan their actions.
The method we describe in the remainder of this subsection applies concepts from economic search theory [16] to this problem.
The CA module sets a reservation value and as long as the sensor-based  observation x is greater than this reservation value, the CA will wait and re-sample the user for a new estimation.
This indirect approach, which does not require interrupting the user, is especially useful in fast-paced domains.
The CA module we designed uses such an indirect method:  ownerenvironment interactions are used as a proxy for measuring whether the owner has certain information.
Lastly, it relies on continuous monitoring of a user"s activities.
The implementation described in Sections 4-5 relies on this fact.
Research on interaction management has  deployed sensor-based statistical models of human interruptibility to infer the degree of distraction likely to be caused by an interruption.
(In a team context they may be designed to share other types as well.)
We use a  sequential search strategy [16] in which one observation is drawn at a time, over multiple search stages.
2.1 Estimating Interruption Costs The cost of interrupting owners derives from the potential  degradation in performance of tasks they are doing caused by the  disruption [1; 9, inter alia].
In its most basic form, the economic search problem aims to identify an opportunity that will minimize expected cost or  maximize expected utility.
The dominating strategy in this model is a reservation-value based strategy which determines a lower bound, and keeps drawing samples as long as no opportunity above the bound was drawn.
In fast-paced environments, there usually is no single task  structure, and some of the activities themselves may have little internal structure.
This work aims to reduce interruption costs by delaying  interruptions to times that are convenient.
