The distribution functions used in the experiments (i.e., the  distribution functions assigned to each user in the simulated  environment) are multi-rectangular shaped.
At each step of a simulation, each of the CAs samples its owner (i.e., all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate) and then  estimates the parameter (either the expected cost when using the  sequential interruption technique described in Section 2 or the  probability that the owner will have the required information) using one of the following methods: (a) relying solely on direct observation (self-learning) data; (b) relying on the combined data of all other agents (average all); and, (c) relying on its own data and  selective portions of the other agents" data based on the selective-sharing mechanism described in Section 3. 
The user associated with the above distribution function spends most of her time in  reporting (notice that this is the largest rectangle in terms of area), an activity associated with a relatively high cost of interruption.
Each  rectangle is associated with one of the user"s typical activities,  characterized by a set of typical interruption costs.
For any value x in rectangle i, we can formulate F(x) and f(x) as: f(x) = pi xi − xi−1 F(x) = i−1X j=1 pj + (x − xi−1)pi xi − xi−1 (6) For example, the multi-rectangular function in Figure 3 depicts a possible interruption cost distribution for a specific user.
They also fit well the parameters the CA is trying to estimate in fast-paced domains, because these parameters are mostly influenced by activities in which the user is engaged.
The  rectangular area represents the probability of the user being engaged in this type of activity when she is randomly interrupted.
Each agent is assigned an external source  (simulating an owner) which it periodically samples to obtain a value from the distribution being estimated.
The user also spends a large portion of her time in planning (associated with a very high cost of interruption), monitoring his team (with a relatively small interruption cost) and receiving reports (mid-level cost of interruption).
(We assume the distribution of cost within each activity is uniform.)
Furthermore, these functions have computational advantages, mostly due to the ability to re-use many of their components when calculating the optimal reservation value in economical search models.
The user spends a relatively small portion of her time in scouting the enemy (associated with relatively high interruption cost) and resting.
Figure 3: Representing interruption cost distribution using a multi-rectangular function Multi-rectangular functions are modular and allow the  representation of any distribution shape by controlling the number and  dimensions of the rectangles used.
The simulation system  enabled us to avoid unnecessary inter-agent scheduling and  communication overhead (which are an inherent part of the Coordinators environment) and thus to better isolate the performance and  effectiveness of the estimation and decision-making mechanisms.
This testbed  environment includes a variable number of agents, each corresponding to a single CA module.
The testbed system enabled us to define either hand-crafted or automatically generated multi-rectangular distribution functions.
Any overlap between the interruption costs of two or more activities results in a new rectangle for the overlapped interval.
This type of function is ideal for representing empirical distribution functions.
We tested the selective-sharing mechanism in a system that  simulates a distributed, Coordinators-like MAS.
It is composed of k rectangles, where each rectangle i is defined over the interval (xi−1, xi), and represents a probability pi, ( Pk i=1 pi =1).
