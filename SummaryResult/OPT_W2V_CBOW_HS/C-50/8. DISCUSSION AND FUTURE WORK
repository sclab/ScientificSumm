This means someone within the network will have access to the last-known-location information of a victim, and perhaps his bearing and speed information as well.
While the paper focuses on the development of a search and rescue system, it also provides some innovative,  systemlevel ideas for information processing in a sensor network system.
In fact, the nature and level of security, privacy and high availability support needed in CenWits strongly depends on the application for which it is being used and the individual subjects involved.
An important goal of CenWits is build small chips that can be implanted in hiking boots or ski jackets.
Our next goal is to deploy this system in a much larger and more realistic environment.
An individual may not be comfortable with providing his/her location and movement information, even though he/she is definitely interested in being located in a timely manner at the time of emergency.
However, when CenWits is used in the context of other applications, security requirements may change.
A large part of CenWits design focuses on addressing the power and memory limitations of current sensor nodes.
Accordingly, we plan to design a multi-level support for  security, privacy and high availability in CenWits.
This paper presents a new search and rescue system called CenWits that has several advantages over the current search and rescue systems.
It solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage  capability.
It utilizes the concept of witnesses to propagate information, infer current possible location and speed of a subject, and identify hot search and rescue areas in case of emergencies.
So far, we have experimented with CenWits in a very restricted environment with a small number of sensors.
Future work includes  developing a more mature prototype addressing important issues such as security, privacy, and high availability.
We anticipate that power and memory will continue to be constrained in such an environment.
There are several pressing concerns regarding security, privacy, and high availability in CenWits.
In fact, power and memory constraints depend on how much weight (of sensor node) a hiker is willing to carry and the cost of these sensors.
In particular, discussions are currenly underway to deploy CenWits in the Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks. 
These advantages include a  looselycoupled system that relies only on intermittent network  connectivity, power and storage efficiency, and low cost.
This goal is similar to the avalanche beacons that are currently implanted in ski jackets.
Since the sensor nodes used in CenWits are fragile, they can fail.
In general, people in hiking community are friendly and usually trustworthy.
For example, an adversary can sniff the witness information to locate endangered  animals, females, children, etc.
So, a bullet-proof security is not really required.
He may inject false information in the system.
We have developed and experimented with a basic  prototype of CenWits at present.
