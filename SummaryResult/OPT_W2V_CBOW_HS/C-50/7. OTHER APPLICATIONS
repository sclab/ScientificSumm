If a PDA shows that a skier has been close to the boundary sensor, the ski patrol can use a long range walkie-talkie to query control center at the resort base to check the witness record of the skier.
They can be placed in a low-altitude plane (e.g a UAV) and be flown over a wilderness area to collect data from wildlife.
If there is no  witness record after the recorded time in the boundary sensor, there is a high chance that a rescue is needed.
But it is too expensive for a ski resort to deploy a connected wireless sensor network through out the mountain.
To collect data, either a satellite transmitter is used, or the data collector has to wait until the GPS receiver brace falls off (after a year or so) and then search for the GPS receiver.
In addition to the hiking in wilderness areas, CenWits can be used in several other applications, e.g.
Since CenWits doesn"t rely on keeping track of a sensor holder all time, but relies on maintaining witnesses, the system is relatively cheaper and widely applicable.
Ski patrols can cruise the mountains every hour, and automatically query the boundary sensor when in range using PDAs.
In wildlife monitoring, a very popular method is to attach a GPS receiver on the animals.
CenWits does nor require any bulky and expensive satellite transmitters, nor is there a need to wait for a year and search for the braces.
Using CenWits, not only can we record the presence of wildlife, we can also record the behavior of wild animals, e.g.
Furthermore, a GPS transmitter is quite bulky and uncomfortable, and as a result, birds always try to get rid of it.
Since CenWits  relies only on intermittent connectivity, it can take advantage of the existing cheap and mature technologies, and thereby make tracking cheaper and fairly accurate.
If a person A is reported missing, and from the witness records we find that his last contacts were C and D, we can trace an approximate location quickly and quite efficiently. 
In fact, the access points need not be statically located.
every second, and so can record presence of skiers who cross the boundary and fall off the cliff.
In large cities, CenWits can be used to complement GPS, since GPS doesn"t work indoor and near skyscrapers.
Using CenWits, we can deploy some sensors at the cliff boundaries.
near a water source, to increase chances of collecting up-to-date data.
Also, it is not yet known if continuous radio signal is harmful to the birds.
Also, access points 190 can be strategically located, e.g.
For example, there are some dangerous cliffs in most ski resorts.
GPS transmitters are very expensive, e.g.
These boundary  sensors emit beacons quite frequently, e.g.
skiing, climbing, wild life monitoring, and person tracking.
CenWits provides a very simple and cost-effective solution in this case.
the one used in geese tracking is $3,000 each [2].
lions might follow the migration of deers.
