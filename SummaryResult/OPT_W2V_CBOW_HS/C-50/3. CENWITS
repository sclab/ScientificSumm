To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.
This implies that if we were to put 20 hikers on a 4-hour, one-way hike evenly, the range of each sensor node should be at least 1056 feet for them to communicate with one another continuously.
The key idea here is that if two sensors come with in range of each other at any time, they become each other"s witnesses.
When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier.
In the witness record  generated by i, Node ID is j, Record Time is the current time in i"s clock, (X,Y) are the coordinates of the location of i that i recorded most recently (either from satellite or an LP), Location Time is the time when the this location was recorded, and Hop Count is 0.
So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.
After 10 minutes, A is in range of an LP that provides an accurate location information to A.
In Figure 2, hiker B"s sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.
The signal strength starts  dropping rapidly for two Mica2 nodes to communicate with each other when they are 180 feet away, and is completely lost when they are 230 feet away from each other[7].
Figure 3: Hiker A is in the range of an access point.
A location point can update a sensor node with its current  location whenever the node is near that LP.
B goes on his way to overnight camping while A heads back to trail head where there is an AP, which emits beacon every 5 seconds to avoid missing any hiker.
This is a very common scenario during a hike.
Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their  witness information.
3.1 Witness Information: Storage A critical concern is that there is limited amount of  memory available on motes (4 KB SDRAM memory, 128 KB flash memory, and 4-512 KB EEPROM).
In addition, A records I saw B at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354", 105◦ 04.9106211") and B records I saw A at 4:17 PM at (41◦ 29.3177354", 105◦ 04.9106211").

CenWits infers the last contact point and draws the circle of possible current locations based on average hiking speed CenWits requires that the clocks of different sensor nodes be loosely synchronized with one another.
Their sensors record the presence of each other.
In our current prototype, we have allocated one byte for Node Id, although this can be increased to two or more bytes if a large number of hikers are expected to be present at the same time.
A dumps all witness information it has collected to the access point.
Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.
By Overlapping this circle with the trail map, two or three possible location of encounter can be  inferred.
CenWits takes advantage of the fact that sensors can  communicate with one another and record their presence.
As long as the clocks are synchronized with in one second range, whether A met B at 12:37"45 or 12:37"46 doesn"t matter in the ordering of witness events and  inferring the path. 
Unfortunately, a lot of  hiking trails are in dense forests and canyons, and it"s not that uncommon to rain after hikers start hiking.
Hot rescue areas can thus be determined synchronization accuracy Cenwits needs is of the order of a second or so.
So, it is important to organize witness information efficiently.
Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.
First, hikers A and B are on two close trails, but out of range of each other (Figure 1).
Each sensor is assigned a unique ID and maintains its current location based on the signal received by its GPS receiver.
When two nodes i and j encounter each other, each node generates a new witness record.
Figure 6: A is back to trail head, It reports the time of encounter with B to AP, but no location information to AP Figure 7: B is still missing after sunset.
LPs are placed at different locations in a wilderness area where GPS receivers don"t work.
A communicates the following information to B: My ID is A; I saw C at 1:23 PM at (39◦ 49.3277655", 105◦ 39.1126776"), I saw E at 3:09 PM at (40◦ 49.2234879", 105◦ 20.3290168").
A records the presence of B and B records the presence of A.
In canyons and rainy forests, a GPS receiver does not work.
When A returns to trail head and uploads its data (Figure 6), the system can draw a circle centered at the LP from which A fetched location information for the range of encounter  location of A and B.
Figure 2: Hiker A and Hiker B are in the range of each other.
LPs allow a sensor node to determine its current location more accurately.
CenWits stores witness information at each node as a set of witness records (Format is shown in Figure 4.
So, we have allocated 3 bytes each for Record Time and Location Time.
Thus when a rescue is required, the possible location of B can be better inferred (See Figures 7 and 8).
Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.
For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.
In  addition, sensor nodes in CenWits synchronize their clocks whenever they are in the range of an AP or an LP.
The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.
It then runs into A on the trail who doesn"t have GPS reception either.
There is no need for any connection  between different access points.
We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute.
To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g.
In fact, in a 4-hour, less-popular hiking trail, one might only run into say five other hikers.
An LP is a very simple device that emits  prerecorded location information at some regular time interval.
B then replies with My ID is B; I saw K at 11:20 AM at (39◦ 51.4531655", 105◦ 41.6776223").
The Figure 8: Based on overlapping landscape, B might have hiked to wrong branch and fallen off a cliff.
In case,  connection to an access point is lost, the information from that 1 A connection is needed only between access points and a processing center.
We describe CenWits in the context of locating lost/injured hikers in wilderness areas.
If an LP runs out of power, the CenWits will continue to work correctly.
3.2 Location Point and Location Inference Although a GPS receiver provides an accurate location information, it has it"s limitation.
It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.
Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.
So, we have allocated 4 bytes each for X and Y coordinates of the location of a node.
182 access point can be downloaded manually, e.g.
Sensors then have to rely on LP to provide coordination In Figure 5, B cannot get GPS reception due to bad weather.
Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter.
Such a  synchronization is trivial when GPS coverage is available.
When there is a heavy cloud cover, GPS users have experienced inaccuracy in the reported location as well.
A and B become each other"s witnesses.
at the trail heads, trail ends, intersection of different trails, scenic view points, resting areas, and so on.
We can represent time in 17 bits to a  second precision.
Each node is assigned a unique Node Id when it enters a trail.
It also emits beacons periodically.
A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.
It can be placed in difficult-to-reach places such as deep canyons and dense rain forests by simply dropping them from an airplane.
To address this, CenWits incorporates the idea of location points (LP).
This accounts for one encounter every 12 minutes on average.
Access points are connected to a  processing center via satellite or some other network1 .
If we use a 32-bit number to represent both longitude and latitude, the precision we get is 40,075,000/232 = 0.0093 meter = 0.37 inches, which is quite precise for our needs.
In fact, a foot precision can be achieved by using only 27 bits.
Figure 5: GPS receiver not working correctly.
However, they are not 183 an essential requirement of CenWits.
Clearly, this is extremely unlikely.
An example of how CenWits operates is illustrated in  Figures 1, 2 and 3.
This is shown in Figure 3.
The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 KM.
