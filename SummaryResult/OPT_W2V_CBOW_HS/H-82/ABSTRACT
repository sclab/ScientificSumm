In this paper, we study how we can build an effective Hidden Web crawler that can autonomously discover and download pages from the Hidden Web.
We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of these policies on 4 real Hidden Web sites and our results are very promising.
Since the only entry point to a Hidden Web site is a query interface, the main challenge that a Hidden Web crawler has to face is how to automatically generate meaningful queries to issue to the site.
Here, we provide a theoretical framework to  investigate the query generation problem for the Hidden Web and we propose effective policies for generating queries automatically.
An ever-increasing amount of information on the Web today is available only through search interfaces: the users have to type in a set of keywords in a search form in order to access the pages from certain Web sites.
These pages are often referred to as the Hidden Web or the Deep Web.
However, according to recent studies, the content provided by many Hidden Web sites is often of very high quality and can be extremely valuable to many users.
Since there are no static links to the Hidden Web pages, search engines cannot discover and index such pages and thus do not return them in the results.
For instance, in one experiment, one of our policies downloaded more than 90% of a Hidden Web site (that contains 14 million  documents) after issuing fewer than 100 queries.
Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.7 [Information Systems]: Digital Libraries; H.3.1 [Information Systems]: Content Analysis and Indexing; H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval.
Our policies proceed iteratively, issuing a different query in every  iteration.
General Terms: Algorithms, Performance, Design.
