In this paper, we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that maximize MAP performance.
Learning a model to optimize for such measures might result in suboptimal MAP performance.
Specifically, we present an SVM algorithm that globally optimizes a hinge-loss relaxation of MAP.
In contrast to recent work directly optimizing for MAP performance by Metzler & Croft [16] and Caruana et al.
The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea.
The second common approach is to learn a function that maximizes a surrogate measure.
Instead, current algorithms tend to take one of two  general approaches.
This approach simplifies the process of obtaining ranking functions with high MAP performance by avoiding additional intermediate steps and heuristics.
However, most current approaches do not optimize for the evaluation measure most often used, namely Mean Average Precision (MAP).
Like [6, 16], our method learns a linear model, but is much more efficient in practice and, unlike [16], can handle many thousands of features.
[6], our technique is computationally efficient while finding a globally optimal solution.
The first approach is to learn a model that estimates the probability of a document being relevant given a query (e.g., [18, 14]).
Performance measures  optimized include accuracy [17, 15], ROCArea [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 21] or modifications of ROCArea [4], and NDCG [2, 3].
Following this, we provide an analysis of  running time.
As a  result, finding good probabilities requires solving a more  difficult problem than necessary, likely requiring more training data to achieve the same MAP performance.
If solved effectively, the ranking with best MAP performance can easily be derived from the  probabilities of relevance.
State of the art information retrieval systems commonly use machine learning techniques to learn ranking functions.
We have also developed a software package implementing our  algorithm that is available for public use1 . 
In fact, although some previous systems have obtained good MAP performance, it is known that neither achieving optimal accuracy nor  ROCArea can guarantee optimal MAP performance[7].
We now describe the algorithm in detail and provide proof of correctness.
We finish with empirical results from experiments on the TREC 9 and TREC 10 Web Track corpus.
However, achieving high MAP only requires finding a good ordering of the documents.
