The prediction-based  routing protocols had a delivery ratio more than 10 times better than that for direct-delivery and random routing, and fewer  transmissions and less storage usage than epidemic routing.
All the prediction-based routing protocols that we have  evaluated had similar performance.
Indeed, there is an opportunity for some adaptation; for example, high priority messages may be given higher transfer and  replication probabilities to increase the chance of delivery and reduce the delay, or a node with infrequent contact may choose to raise its transfer probability.
None of these protocols (direct-delivery, random and epidemic routing) are practical for real deployment of opportunistic networks, 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 Numberofmessagetransmitted(million) Prediction window (hour) Figure 11: Prediction window impact on message transmission of timely-contact routing (semi-log scale).
Our simulation results show that direct delivery had the  lowest delivery ratio, the fewest data transmissions, and no meta-data transmission or data duplication.
We only studied the impact of predicting peer-to-peer contact probability for routing in unicast messages.
The  random protocol increased the chance of delivery for messages  otherwise stuck at some low mobility nodes.
Location  prediction [21] may be used to predict nodes" mobility, and to choose as relays those nodes moving toward the destined location.
We propose a prediction-based routing protocol for  opportunistic networks.
Direct delivery is suitable for  devices that require an extremely low power consumption.
One may also consider other messaging models, for  example, where messages are sent to a location, such that every node at that location will receive a copy of the message.
Our method had a slightly higher delivery ratio, but more transmissions and higher storage usage.
There are many parameters for prediction-based routing protocols, however, and different parameters may produce different results.
They also had fewer data duplications than epidemic routing.
Epidemic routing delivered the most messages.
The excessive transmissions, and data  duplication, however, consume more resources than portable devices may be able to provide.
Research on routing in opportunistic networks is still in its early stage.
because they either had an extremely low delivery ratio, or had an extremely high resource consumption.
We evaluate the performance of our protocol using realistic contact traces, and compare to five existing routing  protocols.
In some applications, context information (such as location) may be available for the peers.
Many other issues of opportunistic networks, such as  security and privacy, are mainly left open.
We anticipate studying these issues in future work.
