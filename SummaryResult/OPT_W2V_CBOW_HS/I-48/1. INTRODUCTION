Although the various approaches to normative systems proposed in the literature differ on technical details, they all share the same  basic intuition that a normative system is a set of constraints on the behaviour of agents in the system; by imposing these constraints, it is hoped that some desirable objective will emerge.
This model of  normative systems was further extended by attributing to each agent a single goal in [16].
Using this scheme, we define a model of ordinal utility, which in turn allows us to interpret our  Kripkebased normative systems as games, in which agents must determine whether to comply with the normative system or not.
In this paper, we develop a model of normative systems in which agents are assumed to have multiple goals, of increasing priority.
We then characterise the  computational complexity of a number of decision problems associated with these Kripke-based normative system games; for example, we show that the complexity of checking whether there exists a  normative system which has the property of being a Nash implementation is NP-complete. 
We thus  provide a very natural bridge between logical structures and languages and the techniques and concepts of game theory, which have proved to be very powerful for analysing social contract-style scenarios such as normative systems [3, 4].
to include the idea of specifying a desirable global objective for a social law as a logical formula, with the idea being that the normative system would be regarded as successful if, after implementing it (i.e., after eliminating all forbidden  actions), the objective formula was guaranteed to be satisfied in the system [15].
However, this model was still too  impoverished to capture the kinds of decision making that take place when an agent decides whether or not to comply with a social law.
However, this model did not take into account the preferences of individual agents, and hence neglected to account for possible strategic behaviour by agents when deciding whether to comply with the normative system or not.
Normative systems, or social laws, have proved to be an attractive approach to coordination in multi-agent systems [13, 14, 10, 15, 1].
We specify an agent"s goals as a hierarchy of formulae of  Computation Tree Logic (CTL), a widely used logic for representing the properties of Kripke structures [8]: the intuition is that goals further up the hierarchy are preferred by the agent over those that appear further down the hierarchy.
The idea of using social laws to coordinate multi-agent systems was proposed by Shoham and Tennenholtz [13, 14]; their approach was extended by van der Hoek et al.
In reality, strategic considerations come into play: an agent takes into account not just whether the normative system would be beneficial for itself, but also whether other agents will rationally choose to participate.
