Thus K † (η C) is the Kripke structure that results if only the agents in C choose to comply with the normative system.
• η C denotes the normative system that is the same as η  except that it only contains the arcs of η that do not correspond to actions of agents in C. We call η C the exclusion of C from η, and it is defined as: η C = {(s, s ) : (s, s ) ∈ η & α(s, s ) ∈ C}.
Formally, let K = S, S0 ,R, A,α, V be a Kripke structure, let C ⊆ A be a set of agents over K, and let η be a normative system over K. Then: • η C denotes the normative system that is the same as η except that it only contains the arcs of η that correspond to the actions of agents in C. We call η C the restriction of η to C, and it is defined as: η C = {(s, s ) : (s, s ) ∈ η & α(s, s ) ∈ C}.
We denote the empty normative system by η∅, so η∅ = ∅.
Formally, if K = S, S0 , R, A, α, V , and η ∈ N (R), then let K†η = K be the Kripke structure K = S , S0 , R , A , α , V where: • S = S , S0 = S0 , A = A , and V = V ; • R = R \ η; and • α is the restriction of α to R : α (s, s ) = j α(s, s ) if (s, s ) ∈ R undefined otherwise.
Thus K † (η C) is the Kripke structure that results if only the agents in C choose not to comply with the normative system (i.e., the only ones who comply are those in A \ C).
Let N (R) = {η : (η ⊆ R) & (R \ η is total)} be the set of normative systems over R. The intended  interpretation of a normative system η is that (s, s ) ∈ η means transition (s, s ) is forbidden in the context of η; hence R \ η denotes the legal transitions of η.
Note that the empty normative system η∅ is reasonable with respect to any transition relation R. The effect of implementing a normative system on a Kripke  structure is to eliminate from it all transitions that are forbidden  according to this normative system (see [15, 1]).
Note that we have η C = η (A\C) and η C = η (A\C).
(continued) When thinking in terms of fairness, it seems natural to consider normative systems η that contain (s, s) or (t, t).
a Kripke structure K = S, S0 , R, A, α, V ) is simply a subset of R, such that R \ η is a total relation.
Formally, a normative system η (w.r.t.
If K is a Kripke  structure, and η is a normative system over K, then K † η denotes the Kripke structure obtained from K by deleting transitions forbidden in η.
Since it is assumed η is reasonable, we are guaranteed that a legal outward transition exists for every state.
Notice that for all K, we have K † η∅ = K. EXAMPLE 1.
More precisely, a  normative system defines, for every possible system transition, whether or not that transition is considered to be legal or not.
The requirement that R\η is total is a  reasonableness constraint: it prevents normative systems which lead to states with no successor.
Similarly, we have η3 {1} = {(s, s)} and η3 {1} = {(t, t)}. 
A normative system with (s, t) would not be fair, in the sense that A♦A ¬p1 ∨ A♦A ¬p2 holds: in all paths, from some moment on, one agent will have control forever.
Let us, for later reference, fix η1 = {(s, s)}, η2 = {(t, t)}, and η3 = {(s, s), (t, t)}.
For our purposes, a normative system is simply a set of constraints on the behaviour of agents in a system [1].
In this context, it is useful to define operators on normative systems which correspond to groups of agents defecting from the  normative system.
Later, we will address the issue of whether or not agents should rationally choose to comply with a particular normative system.
Different normative systems may differ on whether or not a transition is legal.
(Continued) We have η1 {1} = η1 = {(s, s)}, while η1 {1} = η∅ = η1 {2}.
