The semantics of CTL are given with respect to the satisfaction relation |=, which holds between pairs of the form K, s, (where K is a Kripke structure and s is a state in K), and formulae of the language.
We have two states, s and t, and two corresponding Boolean variables p1 and p2, which are 1 In the branching time temporal logic literature, a relation R ⊆ S × S is said to be total iff ∀s ∃s : (s, s ) ∈ R. Note that the term total relation is sometimes used to refer to relations R ⊆ S × S such that for every pair of elements s, s ∈ S we have either (s, s ) ∈ R or (s , s) ∈ R; we are not using the term in this way here.
A Kripke structure is essentially a directed graph, with the vertex set S corresponding to possible states of the system being modelled, and the relation R ⊆ S × S capturing the 881 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS possible transitions of the system; intuitively, these transitions are caused by agents in the system performing actions, although we do not include such actions in our semantic model (see, e.g., [13, 2, 15] for related models which include actions as first class citizens).
We let S0 denote the set of possible initial states of the system.
The remaining CTL temporal operators are defined: A♦ϕ ≡ A( U ϕ) E♦ϕ ≡ E( U ϕ) A ϕ ≡ ¬E♦¬ϕ E ϕ ≡ ¬A♦¬ϕ We say ϕ is satisfiable if K, s |= ϕ for some Kripke structure K and state s in K; ϕ is valid if K, s |= ϕ for all Kripke structures K and states s in K. The problem of checking whether K, s |= ϕ for given K, s, ϕ (model checking) can be done in deterministic polynomial time, while checking whether a given ϕ is satisfiable or whether ϕ is valid is EXPTIME-complete [8].
K, π[u] |= ψ and ∀v, (0 ≤ v < u) : K, π[v] |= ϕ The remaining classical logic connectives (∧, →, ↔) are assumed to be defined as abbreviations in terms of ¬, ∨, in the conventional manner.
We therefore assume a set A of agents, and we label each transition in R with the agent that causes the transition via a function α : R → A.
We will sometimes refer to and think of an s-path as a possible  computation, or system evolution, from s. EXAMPLE 1.
The syntax of CTL is defined by the following grammar: ϕ ::= | p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∨ ϕ | E fϕ | E(ϕ U ϕ) | A fϕ | A(ϕ U ϕ) where p ∈ Φ.
The satisfaction relation is defined as follows: K, s |= ; K, s |= p iff p ∈ V (s) (where p ∈ Φ); K, s |= ¬ϕ iff not K, s |= ϕ; K, s |= ϕ ∨ ψ iff K, s |= ϕ or K, s |= ψ; K, s |= A fϕ iff ∀π ∈ Π(s) : K, π[1] |= ϕ; K, s |= E fϕ iff ∃π ∈ Π(s) : K, π[1] |= ϕ; K, s |= A(ϕ U ψ) iff ∀π ∈ Π(s), ∃u ∈ N, s.t.
However, we find it convenient to include within our model the agents that cause transitions.
Collecting these components together, an agent-labelled Kripke structure (over Φ) is a 6-tuple: K = S, S0 , R, A, α, V , where: • S is a finite, non-empty set of states, • S0 ⊆ S (S0 = ∅) is the set of initial states; • R ⊆ S × S is a total binary relation on S, which we refer to as the transition relation1 ; • A = {1, .
We write K |= ϕ if K, s0 |= ϕ for all s0 ∈ S0 , and |= ϕ if K |= ϕ for all K. 882 The Sixth Intl.
Let us say that our set of initial states S0 equals {s, t}, i.e., we don"t make any assumptions about who initially has control over the resource.
Let ΠR(s) denote the set of s-paths over R; since it will usually be clear from  context, we often omit reference to R, and simply write Π(s).
of Boolean variables to express the properties of individual states S: we use a function V : S → 2Φ to label each state with the Boolean variables true (or satisfied) in that state.
, n} is a set of agents; • α : R → A labels each transition in R with an agent; and • V : S → 2Φ labels each state with the set of propositional variables true in that state.
K, π[u] |= ψ and ∀v, (0 ≤ v < u) : K, π[v] |= ϕ K, s |= E(ϕ U ψ) iff ∃π ∈ Π(s), ∃u ∈ N, s.t.
In the interests of brevity, we shall hereafter refer to an  agentlabelled Kripke structure simply as a Kripke structure.
For example, one might consider the agent totality requirement, that in every state, every agent has at least one possible transition  available: ∀s∀i ∈ A∃s : (s, s ) ∈ R and α(s, s ) = i.
We denote the set of CTL formula over Φ by LΦ; since Φ is understood, we usually omit reference to it.
Our model is intended to correspond to the well-known interleaved concurrency model from the reactive systems literature: thus an arc corresponds to the execution of an atomic action by one of the processes in the system, which we call agents.
A path over a transition relation R is an infinite sequence of states π = s0, s1, .
We will use CTL to express agents" goals.
which must satisfy the property that ∀u ∈ N: (su , su+1) ∈ R. If u ∈ N, then we denote by π[u] the component indexed by u in π (thus π[0] denotes the first element, π[1] the second, and so on).
Our running example is of a system with a single non-sharable resource, which is desired by two agents.
Each agent has two possible actions, when in possession of the resource: either give it away, or keep it.
A path π such that π[0] = s is an s-path.
Think of pi as meaning agent i has currently control over the resource.
It is important to note that, in contrast to such models as [2, 15], we are therefore here not modelling synchronous action.
It is also worth noting that for some domains, other constraints may be more appropriate than simple totality.
2.1 CTL We now define Computation Tree Logic (CTL), a branching time temporal logic intended for representing the properties of Kripke structures [8].
Finally, we use a vocabulary Φ = {p, q, .
This  assumption is not in fact essential for our analysis, but it greatly  simplifies the presentation.
Note that since CTL is well known and widely  documented in the literature, our presentation, though complete, will be somewhat terse.
Obviously there are infinitely many different s-paths and t-paths.
We use Kripke structures as our basic semantic model for  multiagent systems [8].
