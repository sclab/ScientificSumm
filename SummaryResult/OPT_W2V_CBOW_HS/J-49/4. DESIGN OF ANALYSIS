Lin-All-u, the equally weighted LinOP with all participants, is basically the arithmetic mean of all  participants" opinions.
To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.
Since the  probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants" consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win.
Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants" performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.
NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online  exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the  opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of  information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and  individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.
4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of  information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and  NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from  ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used.
The top players,  measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.
For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.
For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.
The possible opinion pools, varied in pooling functions, weighting methods, and number of expert opinions, are shown 61 Table 1: Pooled Expert Predictions # Symbol Description 1 Lin-All-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LinOP of all experts.
When a participant did not enter a prediction for a  particular game, that participant was removed from the opinion pool for that game.
For week 2, we select opinions of 20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the top 20.
However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants" goals are to maximize the  probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing  available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets.
Log-All-u is simply the geometric mean of all opinions.
The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation  methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].
Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because  assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.
For  example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.
If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team A"s winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.
than half of the games, this time is only about an hour  earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games.
We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the market"s prediction of the probability that a team will win.
n is the number of expert opinions that are pooled, and All indicates that all opinions are combined.
The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an expert"s expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.
Absolute error simply measures the difference between a perfect prediction (1 for  winning team) and the actual prediction.
al [36] have compared the effect of money on the  performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.
The  performancebased weights are determined according to previous  accumulated score in the contest.
For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.
Experts are chosen in a similar way for later weeks.
Since there is no  performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all  participants in the first week.
We use u to symbolize unweighted (equally weighted)  opinion pools.
As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of  experts.
• Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both  TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.
Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures" last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.
Quadratic score is the scoring function that is used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.
We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.
5 Log-All-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LogOP of all experts.
We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.
Thus, the top 20 participants can change from week to week.
The suggested strategy at the contest  website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.
We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].
For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.
A prediction with lower absolute error is more accurate.
6 Log-All-w Weighted (performance-weighted)  LogOP of all experts.
A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.
In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.
Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.
Absolute Error = Prob Lose, where Prob Lose is the probability assigned to the eventual losing team.
For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected.
A prediction with higher quadratic score is more accurate.
This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize  expected score.
2 Lin-All-w Weighted (performance-weighted) LinOP of all experts.
For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.
Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyone"s score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative.
The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at  NewsFutures" online shop.
• TS: Prediction equals TradeSports" last trade price  before noon of the game day divided by 100.
4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is  straightforward.
w is used for weighted (performance-weighted) opinion pools.
The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.
4.2.2 Performance Measures We use three common metrics to assess prediction  accuracy of information markets and opinion pools.
We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skiera"s three steps for designing an information market [37] as below.
Only the best performing experts are selected.
For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score.
(4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the  smallest cumulative scorej otherwise.
In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.
3 Lin-n-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LinOP with n experts.
This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.
This contrasts with the  ProbabilityFootball average reported on the contest website and used by Servan-Schreiber et.
Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.
7 Log-n-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LogOP with n experts.
A  prediction with higher (less negative) logarithmic score is more accurate. 
Quadratic score can be negative.
They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.
4 Lin-n-w Weighted (performance-weighted) LinOP with n experts.
For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.
al [36] in  evaluating the prediction accuracy of information markets.
They can accumulate  virtual money by trading securities.
On the  contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.
8 Log-n-w Weighted (performance-weighted)  LogOP with n experts.
Logarithmic Score = log(Prob W in), where Prob W in is the probability assigned to the eventual winning team.
We will use them  interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.
al [36], where unreported  predictions were converted to 0.5 probability predictions.
Information market data was acquired, by using a  specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.com"s Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.com"s Sports Exchange [1].
The contest is free to enter.
The logarithmic score, like the quadratic score, is a proper scoring rule.
• Financial market design: Both markets at  TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.
Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.
It is a linear  transformation of squared error, Prob Lose2 , which is one of the mostly used metrics in evaluating forecasting  accuracy.
Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.
TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.
Lin represents linear, and Log represents Logarithmic.
Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) .
• Incentive for participation and information  revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.
Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.
Quadratic Score = 100 − 400 × (Prob Lose2 ).
TradeSports is a real-money exchange.
4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between  September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.
These  measures have been used by Servan-Schreiber et.
in Table 1.
