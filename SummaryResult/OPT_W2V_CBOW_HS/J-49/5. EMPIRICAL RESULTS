The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction  accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts.
When there are more than 500 experts, increasing number of  experts used in LogOP improves the prediction accuracy  measured by absolute error, but worsens the accuracy measured by the other two metrics.
To test whether this  difference is statistically significant, we shuﬄe predictions from two methods, randomly label half of predictions as NF and the other half as Log-All-u, and compute the difference of mean absolute error of the newly formed NF and Log-All-u data.
We can see that, in terms of mean values of accuracy measures, the differences of all methods are not statistically significant to any reasonable degree.
For LinOP, increasing the number of experts in  general increases or keeps the same the level of prediction accuracy.
We first examine the  effect of number of opinions on prediction accuracy by forming opinion pools with the number of expert opinions varying from 1 to 960.
Since NF, TS, and the four opinion pools form their predictions using information available at noon of the game 63 Table 2: Number and Percentage of Games that Predicted Favorites Win NF TS Lin-All-u Log-All-u Log-All-w Log-200-u Number 142 137 144 144 143 141 Percentage 67.62% 65.24% 68.57% 68.57% 68.10% 67.14% Table 3: Mean of Prediction Accuracy Measures Absolute Error Quadratic Score Logarithmic Score NF 0.4253 15.4352 -0.6136 (0.0121) (4.6072) (0.0258) TS 0.4275 15.2739 -0.6121 (0.0118) (4.3982) (0.0241) Lin-All-u 0.4292 13.0525 -0.6260 (0.0126) (4.8088) (0.0268) Log-All-u 0.4024 10.0099 -0.6546 (0.0173) (6.6594) (0.0418) Log-All-w 0.4059 10.4491 -0.6497 (0.0168) (6.4440) (0.0398) Log-200-u 0.4266 12.3868 -0.6319 (0.0133) (5.0764) (0.0295) *Numbers in parentheses are standard errors.
It is a very interesting observation that even if many participants of the ProbabilityFootball contest do not provide accurate individual predictions (they have negative quadratic scores in the contest), including their opinions into the opinion pool still increases the prediction accuracy.
Numbers in parentheses are  standard errors, which estimate the standard deviation of the mean.
If a prediction of the probability that a team will win a game, either from an opinion pool or an information  market, is higher than 0.5, we say that the team is the predicted favorite for the game.
Compared with Lin-All-u, Log-All-u has lower absolute error when it is less than 0.5, and greater absoluter error when it is greater than 0.5, which indicates that predictions of Log-All-u are bolder, more close to 0 or 1, than those of Lin-All-u.

When a participant does not provide a probability assessment for a game, the  contest considers their prediction as 0.5..
Table 3 displays mean values of these measures over 210 games.

Judged by the mean values of accuracy measures in Table 3, all methods have similar accuracy levels, with NF and TS slightly better than the opinion pools.
To take into consideration of skewness of  distributions, we also report median values of accuracy measures in Table 4.
When we increase the number of experts in an opinion pool, we are incorporating more extreme predictions into it.
For LogOP, increasing the number of experts increases the prediction accuracy at the beginning.
The basic idea of randomization test is that, by randomly swapping  predictions of two methods numerous times, an empirical  distribution for the difference of prediction accuracy can be  constructed.
For each game, we sort experts according to their accumulated quadratic score in previous weeks.
Predictions of the best performing n participants are picked to form an opinion pool with n experts.
*Best value for each metric is shown in bold.
Instead, we remove participants from games that they do not provide assessments, pooling only the available opinions together.
However, the median values of accuracy measures indicate that  LogAll-u and Log-All-w opinion pools are more accurate than all other predictions.
But the curves (including the points with all experts) for mean quadratic score, and mean logarithmic score have slight bell-shapes, which represent a decrease in prediction accuracy when the number of experts is very large.
The 10,000 differences of mean absolute error results in an  empirical distribution of the difference.
The relative  prediction accuracy of LogOP and LinOP flips when using  different accuracy measures.
5.1 Performance of Opinion Pools Depending on how many opinions are used, there can be numerous different opinion pools.
The resulting LogOP is bolder, and hence has lower mean quadratic score and mean logarithmic score.
But, using all other performance measures, LinOP outperforms LogOP.
This leads us to conclude that the difference of mean absolute error between NF and Log-All-u is not  statistically significant, if we choose the level of significance to be 0.05.
We then take a closer look at prediction accuracy of  information markets and opinion pools using the three  performance measures.
Selecting experts according to past performance also does not help.
Using this empirical distribution, we are then able to evaluate that at what confidence level the observed  difference reflects a real difference.
This makes sense in the context of the contest, since 0.5 always yields 0 quadratic score.
5.2 Comparison of Information Markets and Opinion Pools Through the first screening of various opinion pools, we  select Lin-All-u, Log-All-u, Log-All-w, and Log-200-u to  compare with predictions from information markets.
When it 64 Table 4: Median of Prediction Accuracy Measures Absolute Error Quadratic Score Logarithmic Score NF 0.3800 42.2400 -0.4780 TS 0.4000 36.0000 -0.5108 Lin-All-u 0.3639 36.9755 -0.5057 Log-All-u 0.3417 53.2894 -0.4181 Log-All-w 0.3498 51.0486 -0.4305 Log-200-u 0.3996 36.1300 -0.5101 *Best value for each metric is shown in bold.
Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and  LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance  measures across all 210 games.
These results indicate that differences in prediction  accuracy between information markets and opinion pools are not statistically significant.
Log-All-u and Log-All-w offer either the best or the worst predictions.
comes to median values of prediction accuracy, Log-All-u outperforms Lin-All-u at a high confidence level.
Because quadratic score and logarithmic score penalize bold predictions that are wrong, LogOP is less accurate when measured in these terms.
Unweighted opinion pools and performance-weighted opinion pools have similar levels of prediction  accuracy, especially for LinOP.
All four opinion pools correctly  predict a similar number and percentage of games as NF and TS.
The first lines of table cells are results for absolute error.
When there are more than 200 experts, the prediction accuracy of LinOP is stable regarding the number of experts.
In the ProbabilityFootball Competition, not all 1966 registered participants provide their probability  assessments for every game.
Log-200-u, the LogOP with the 200 top performing experts, provides more stable predictions.
Weighting does not seem to improve performance.
Comparing our observed difference, 0.0229, with this distribution, we find that the observed difference is greater than 75.37% of the empirical differences.
One explanation of this phenomena could be that biases of individual judgment can offset with each other when opinions are diverse, which makes the pooled prediction more accurate.
The second and third lines are dedicated to quadratic score and logarithmic score respectively.
Our treatment increases the prediction accuracy of Lin-All-u significantly. 
For example, the mean absolute error of NF is higher than that of Log-All-u by 0.0229, as shown in Table 3.
al [36], in which NewsFutures"s information markets have been shown to provide  statistically significantly more accurate predictions than the  (unweighted) average of all ProbabilityFootball opinions.
LogOP seems more accurate than LinOP in terms of mean absolute error.
Examining expert opinions, we find that participants who rank lower are more frequent in offering extreme predictions (0 or 1) than those ranking high in the list.
Similar reasoning accounts for the fourth trend.
We employ the randomization test [32] to study whether the differences in prediction accuracy presented in Table 3 and Table 4 are statistically significant.
The curves for mean absolute error, on the other hand, show a consistent increase of accuracy.
960 is the smallest number of participants for all games.
However, the performance of LogOP is not consistent when evaluated using different metrics.
To investigate this disagreement, we plot the absolute error of Log-All-u and Lin-All-u for each game in Figure 2.
We use all of the three to stand for the performance of LogOP in our later comparison.
Not all 1966 registered ProbabilityFootball participants offer  probability assessments for each game.
We can see the following trends in the figure.
Table 5 and Table 6 are results of randomization test for mean and median differences respectively.
Lin-All-u as shown in Figure 1 can represent what LinOP can achieve.
Table 2 presents the number and  percentage of games that predicted favorites actually win, out of a total of 210 games.
The third trend presents a controversy.
This is due to the nature of linear and logarithmic aggregating functions.
The ProbabilityFootball average reported on the  contest website and used by Servan-Schreiber et.
Each cell of the table is for two different prediction methods, represented by name of the row and name of the column.
If it is greater than 0.5, the underdog wins.
The above procedure is repeated 10,000 times.
The discrepancy emerges in dealing with missing data.
al includes these 0.5 estimates.
This may seem to contradict the  result of Servan-Schreiber et.
