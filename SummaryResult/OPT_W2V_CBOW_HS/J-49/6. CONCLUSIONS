In screening for representative opinion pools to compare with information markets, we investigate the effect of weights and number of experts on prediction accuracy.
We have selected four opinion pools to represent the prediction accuracy level that LinOP and LogOP can achieve.
It is worthy of more attention whether information  markets, as an alternative forecasting method, can be used together with other methods to improve our  predictions. 
It is quite robust in the sense that even if the included individual predictions are less accurate, averaging over all opinions still gives better (or equally good) predictions.
But the advantages do not compromise their prediction accuracy to any extent.
• The possibility of combining information markets with other forecasting methods to achieve better prediction accuracy.
In this paper, we compare prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) using  predictions from two markets and 1966 individuals regarding the outcomes of 210 American football games during the 2003 NFL season.
Previous research has shown that information markets give as accurate or more accurate predictions than individual experts and polls.
Our results on both the comparison of information markets and opinion pools and the relative performance of different opinion pools are summarized as below.

In the future, we are interested in further  exploring: • Performance comparison of information markets with other opinion pools and mathematical aggregation  procedures.
LogOP yields predictions that are closer to the  extremes, 0 or 1.
However, information  markets, as an adaptive mechanism to aggregate different  opinions of market participants, have not been calibrated against many belief aggregation methods.
If we define expertise more narrowly, selecting experts in certain football teams to predict games involving these teams, will the predictions of opinion pools be more accurate?
LogOP yields bolder predictions than LinOP.
• Whether defining expertise more narrowly can improve predictions of opinion pools.
On the contrary, information markets can provide real-time predictions, which are hardly achievable through resorting to experts.
Simply averaging across all experts seems resulting in better predictions than individual opinions and  opinion pools with a few experts.
Weighting expert opinions according to past  performance does not seem to significantly improve  prediction accuracy of either LinOP or LogOP.
Chen, Fine, and Huberman [11] use an information market to determine the risk attitude of participants, and then perform a nonlinear aggregation of their  predictions based on their risk attitudes.
Comparing performance-weighted opinion pools with equally weighted opinion pools, we do not observe much difference in terms of prediction accuracy.
Compared with opinion pools, it is less constrained by space and time, and can eliminate the efforts to identify experts and decide belief aggregation methods.
It will be meaningful to investigate their relative  prediction accuracy with other belief aggregation methods such as Bayesian approaches.
The nonlinear aggregation mechanism is shown to outperform both the market and the best individual participants.
With all four performance metrics, our two  information markets obtain similar prediction accuracy as the four opinion pools.
There are also a number of theoretical expert algorithms with proven worst-case performance bounds [10] whose average-case or  practical performance would be instructive to investigate.
In this paper, we only compare information markets with two simple opinion pools, linear and logarithmic.
An information markets is a self-organizing mechanism for aggregating information and making predictions.
The arithmetic average of all opinions (Lin-All-u) is a simple, robust, and efficient opinion pool.
At the same time point ahead of the events,  information markets offer as accurate predictions as our selected opinion pools.
With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets have recently emerged as an alternative tool for predicting future events.
In our analysis, we broadly treat participants of the ProbabilityFootball contest as experts in all games.
*Confidence above 95% is shown in bold.
Since we only use one performance-weighting method,  calculating the weights according to past accumulated quadratic score that participants earned, this might due to the weighting method we chose.
