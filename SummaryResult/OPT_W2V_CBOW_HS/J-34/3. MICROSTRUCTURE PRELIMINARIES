Shortly we show that if we change only one order"s value (price), we remain in this set for any sequence of limit orders.
Now regardless the state that we were in, b1 is still only in one buy book (but with a different price), and thus we remain in the same state in S. The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows from the above lemmas. 
For the case when the order appears only in one set of books, without loss of generality we assume that the cancellation cancels a buy order at b1.
Then  regardless of whether the new buy order is executed or not, the state remains in ¯ab (the analysis is similar to an arriving sell order).
If a buy (sell, respectively) limit order comes in above the ask  (below the bid, respectively) price, then the order is matched with orders on the opposing books until either the incoming order"s volume is filled, or no further matching is possible, in which case the remaining incoming volume is placed in the books.
Next we provide an analysis of the more subtle case where the arriving item is a buy order.
If at any time the current books (A1, B1) and (A2, B2) are in the set ab (and thus identical), then  modifying the price of the next order keeps the state in S. Proof.
At any point (index) i in the two sequences we shall use (A1, B1) to denote the sell and buy books (respectively) in Σ, and (A2, B2) to denote the sell and buy books in Σ ; for notational convenience we omit explicitly superscripting by the current index i.
Throughout this section, we consider an arbitrary order sequence Σ in the absolute model, and any 1-modification Σ of Σ.
We now give a sequence of lemmas showing 123 Executed with two orders Not executed in both Arrivng buy order Arriving buy order Arriving buy order Arriving sell order ¯ab ab ¯a¯b Executed only with a1 (not a1 and a2) Executed with a1 and a2 Figure 3: The state diagram when starting at state ¯ab.
In the absolute model, we do indeed interpret vi as simply being the price of the limit order.
For the second case, the buy books remain unchanged and identical, and the sell books have the new sell order added to both of them (and thus still differ by one order).
Following the arrival of their only differing order, Σ and Σ are identical.
In the  relative model, if the current order book configuration is (A, B) (where A is the sell and B the buy book), the price of the order is ask(A) + vi if ti is sell, and bid(B) + vi if ti is buy, where by ask(X) and bid(X) we denote the price of the order at the top of the book X.
Here ni is an order identifier, ti is the order type (buy, sell, or cancel), and vi is the limit order value.
For subcase (a), by our assumption a1 < a2, then either (1) both asks get executed, the sell books become identical, and we move to state ab; (2) neither ask is executed and we remain in state ¯ab; or (3) only ask(A1) = a1 is executed, in which case we move to state ¯a¯b with A2 = A1 ∪ {a2} and B2 = B1 ∪ {b2}, where b2 is the arriving buy order price.
Although the order books are sorted by price, we will use (for example) A1 ∪ {a2} = A2 to indicate that A2 contains an order at some price a2 that is not present in A1, but that otherwise A1 and A2 are identical; thus deleting the order at a2 in A2 would render the books the same.
Suppose the arriving order is a sell order and we change it from a1 to a2; assume without loss of generality that a1 > a2.
How then do orders get (partially) executed?
Similarly, B1 ∪ {b2} = B2 ∪ {b1} means B1 contains an order at price b1 not present in B2, B2 contains an order at price b2 not present in B1, and that otherwise B1 and B2 are identical.
Let a¯b be the set of states such that B1∪{b2} = B2∪{b1}, where b1 = b2, and A1 = A2.
In this model, limit orders arrive in a temporal sequence, with each order specifying its limit price and an indication of its type (buy or sell).
Using this notation, we now define a set of stable system states, where each state is composed from the order books of the original and the modified sequences.
We can choose to submit a limit order with this specification, and our order will be placed in a queue called the buy order book, which is ordered by price, with the highest offered unexecuted buy price at the top (often referred to as the bid).
If the current order book state lies in S, then following the arrival of a cancellation it remains in S. Proof.
For the first case, the buy books remain identical (the bid is executed in both) and the sell books remain unchanged.
The analysis of an arriving buy order is similar.
For subcase (b), either (1) buy order is executed in neither sell book we remain in state ¯ab; or (2) the buy order is executed in both sell books and stay in state ¯ab with A1 ∪ {a } = A2 ∪ {a2}; or (3) only ask(A1) = a1 is executed and we move to state ¯a¯b.
Thus either the arriving sell order is executed with the same buy order in both buy books, or it is not executed in both buy books.
It shows that in the absolute model, the effects that the modification of a single order has on the resulting  evolution of the order books is extremely limited.
• close(Σ): Price of the last (closing) execution.
This diagram provides the intuition of Lemma 4.3 that following the initial difference covered by Lemma 4.2, the state remains in S forever on the remaining (identical) sequence.
Then the order books (A1, B1) and (A2, B2) determined by Σ and Σ lie in the set S of stable states at all times.
The next and final lemma deals with cancellations.
In the case that ti is a cancel, ni matches a previously placed order and vi is ignored.
We will shortly establish that at all times i, (A1, B1) and (A2, B2) are very close.
It is important to note that the prices of executions are the prices specified in the limit orders already in the books, not the prices of the incoming order that is immediately executed.
We first show that from state ¯ab we remain in S regardless the next order.
This diagram describes all  transitions that can take place after the arrival of the order on which Σ and Σ differ.
We first provide the analysis for the case of an  arriving sell order.
This order would be partially filled by the two 500-share sell orders at $24.069 in the sell books, the 500-share sell order at $24.07, and the 200-share sell order at $24.08, for a total of 1700 shares executed.
Suppose that MSFT is currently trading at roughly $24.07 a share (see Figure 1, which shows an actual snapshot of an MSFT order book on INET), but we are only willing to buy the 1000 shares at $24.04 a share or lower.
Note that this also means that in a pure limit order exchange such as INET, market orders can be simulated by limit orders with extreme price values.
If the current configuration is in the set ¯a¯b, then for any order the state will remain in S The proofs of these two lemmas are omitted, but are  similar in spirit to that of Lemma 4.3.
Let ¯a¯b be the set of states in which A1 = A2∪{a1} and B1 = B2∪{b1}, or in which A2 = A1 ∪ {a2} and B2 = B1 ∪ {b2}.
If neither order is executed immediately, then we move to state ¯ab; if both of them are executed then we stay in state ab; and if only a2 is executed then we move to state ¯a¯b.
• lastask(Σ): Ask at end of the sequence.
When a cancellation order arrives, one of the  following possibilities holds: (1) the order is still in both sets of books, (2) it is not in either of them and (3) it is only in one of them.
For the first two cases it is easy to see that the  cancellation effect is identical on both sets of books, and thus the state remains unchanged.
The first is when the top of both sell books (the ask) is identical.
Rather than removing b1 from the book we can change it to have price 0, meaning this buy order will never be executed and is effectively canceled.
Similarly, a sell order book for sell limit orders is maintained, this time with the lowest sell price offered (often referred to as the ask) at its top.
Every limit order arrives atomically and instantaneously - there is a strict temporal sequence in which orders arrive, and two orders can never arrive simultaneously.
Without loss of generality we limit attention to a model in which every order is for a single share; large order volumes can be represented by 1-share sequences.
• volume(Σ): Number of shares executed (traded) in the sequence Σ.
In the example provided by Figure 1, our order would be placed immediately after the extant order for 5,503 shares at $24.04; though we offer the same price, this order has arrived before ours.
Here we discuss two subcases: (a) ask(A1) = a1 and ask(A2) = a2, and (b) ask(A1) = a1 and ask(A2) = a .
If the current state is in the set ¯ab, then for any order the state will remain in S. Proof.
Figure 1: Sample INET order books for MSFT.
Thus in this example, the 1700 executed shares would be at different prices.
The remaining 300 shares of the incoming buy order would become the new bid of the buy book at $24.08.
We have deliberately called vi in the definition above the limit order value rather than price, since our two models will differ in their interpretation of vi (as being absolute or relative).
Thus, the order books are sorted from the most  competitive limit orders at the top (high buy prices and low sell prices) down to less competitive limit orders.
By definition, the order books always consist exclusively of  unexecuted orders - they are queues of orders hopefully  waiting for the price to move in their direction.
• lastbid(Σ): Bid at the end of the sequence.
The following establishes that  immediately after the arrival of this differing order, the state lies in S. Lemma 4.2.
Let Σ = σ1, ...σn be a sequence of limit orders, where each σi has the form ni, ti, vi .
The idea of the proof of this theorem is contained in  Figure 2, which shows a state transition diagram labeled by the categories of stable states.
For instance, suppose in the example of Figure 1 a buy order for 2000 shares arrived with a limit price of $24.08.
Let ab be the set of all states (A1, B1) and (A2, B2) such that A1 = A2 and B1 = B2.
For simplicity we consider only  modifications to the limit order values, but our results generalize to any modification.
3.1 Formal Definitions We now provide a formal model for the limit order  pro122 cess described above.
This gives rise to the definition of the last price of the exchange, which is simply the last price at which the exchange executed an order.
Note that in ¯ab the buy books are identical (B1 = B2).
If the current state is in the set a¯b, then for any order the state will remain in S. Lemma 4.5.
In a limit order, we specify not only the desired volume (1000 shares), but also the desired price.
(1-Modification Theorem) Consider any sequence of orders Σ and any 1-modification Σ of Σ.
Like the actual exchanges, we also allow cancellation of a standing  (unexecuted) order in the books any time prior to its execution.
We now define the various quantities whose stability  properties we examine in the absolute and relative models.
If there are multiple limit orders at the same price, they are ordered by time of arrival (with older orders higher in the book).
The bid and ask prices together are sometimes referred to as the inside market, and the difference between them as the spread.
Here a1 and a2 are as in the definition of ¯ab in  Definition 4.1, and a is some other price.
THE 1-MODIFICATION THEOREM In this section we provide our most important technical result.
Let ¯ab be the set of states such that A1 ∪ {a2} = A2 ∪ {a1}, where a1 = a2, and B1 = B2.
We then apply this result to derive strong stability results for all of the aforementioned quantities in the absolute model.
It is this quantity that is usually meant when people casually refer to the (ticker) price of a stock.
The intuition of this lemma is demonstrated in Figure 3.
• average(Σ): Average execution price.
In exchanges such as INET, any order can be withdrawn or canceled by the party that placed it any time prior to execution.
The market mechanism we examine in this paper is driven by the simple and standard concept of a limit  order.
We are left to deal with case where ask(A1) and ask(A2) are different.
ab ¯a¯b a¯b¯ab Figure 2: Diagram representing the set S of stable states and the possible movements transitions in it after the change.
Our main interest in this paper is the effects that the  modification of a small number of limit orders can have on the resulting dynamics.
Finally we define S = ab ∪ ¯ab ∪ ¯ba ∪ ¯a¯b as the set of stable states.
A k-modification of Σ is a sequence Σ such that for exactly k indices i1, ..., ik vij = vij , tij = tij , and nij = nij .
Suppose we wish to purchase 1000 shares of Microsoft (MSFT) stock.
(Note vi can be negative.)
For this case we need to take care of several different scenarios.
All of these are standard quantities of common interest in financial markets.
