The proof will show that every execution in Σ besides the execution of the modified order and the last  execution has a matching execution in Σ with a price different by at most s2(Σ), and will use the fact that pmax + s2(Σ) is a bound on the price in Σ .
Referring to the proof of the 1-Modification Theorem,  suppose we are in state ¯a¯b, where we have in one sequence (which can be either Σ or Σ ) an additional buy order b and an additional sell order a.
We note that the proof of Theorem 5.6 actually establishes that the bid and ask of the original and modified sequences are within s2(Σ) at all times.
We define s2(Σ) to be the maximum second spread in the sequence Σ following the change.
Since Σ and Σ are at most k apart,we have that by k insertions we change ˜Σ to either Σ or Σ , and by Lemma 5.3 its set of executed orders is at most 2k from each.
In this case we know that either the previous execution happened simultaneously in both sequences at time t, and thus all three executions are within the second spread of Σ at time t (the first execution in Σ by definition, the execution at Σ from identical  arguments as in the former case, and the third by Lemma 5.9).
Then the set of the executed orders generated by Σ and Σ differ by at most 2k.
If the last execution happens only in Σ we know that the next execution of Σ will be at most s2(Σ) away from its previous execution by Lemma 5.9.
We motivate this condition by first showing that without it, by changing one order, we can change average(Σ) by any  positive value x. Lemma 5.5.
We have bid(Σ) + s2(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ ) ≥ bid(Σ ), where we used the fact that ask(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ ) since the modified sequence has an additional order.
Then all executions take place at the ask, which is always p, and thus average(Σ) = p. Now suppose we modify only the first sell order to be at price p+1+x.
Now if the bid is not the additional order we are done, otherwise we have the  following: bid(Σ) ≤ ask(Σ) ≤ sb(Σ) + s2(Σ) = bid(Σ ) + s2(Σ), where sb(Σ) ≤ bid(Σ ) since the original buy book has only one additional order.
Let Σ be any sequence.
|lastask(Σ) − lastask(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ) where s2(Σ) is the maximum over the second spread in Σ following the 1-modification.
This initial sell order will never be executed, and now all executions take place at the bid, which is always p + x.
|average(Σ) − average(Σ )| ≤ Pk =1  2(pmax +s +1(Σ)) volume(Σ) + s +1(Σ)  where s (Σ) is the maximum over the -spread in Σ following the first modification.
Now after this execution the bid is at least the second highest buy order at time t, if the former bid was executed and no higher buy orders arrived, and higher otherwise.
Similarly, the ask is at most the second lowest sell order at time t. Therefore, the next execution price is at least the second bid at time t and at most the second ask at time t, which is at most s2(Σ) away from the bid/ask at time t. Lemma 5.10.
We are now ready to state a stability result for the average execution price in the absolute model.
This motivates the  introduction of a quantity we call the second spread of the order books, which is defined as the difference between the prices of the second order in the sell book and the second order in the buy book (as opposed to the bid-ask difference, which is commonly called the spread).
Let Σ be a sequence of alternating sell and buy orders in which each seller offers p and each buyer p + x, and the first order is a sell.
Since bid(Σ ) ≥ sb(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ) − s2(Σ) ≥ bid(Σ) − s2(Σ) we have that |bid(Σ) − bid(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ) as desired.
We note that in a liquid stock, such as those we examine experimentally in Section 7, the second spread will typically be quite small and in fact almost always equal to the spread.
Now assume that the books with the additional orders are for the modified sequence Σ .
By Lemma 5.7 the spread of both sequences is bounded by s2(Σ), which implies that the price of the execution in Σ was at most a + s2(Σ), while execution is in Σ is at price a, and thus the prices are different by at most s2(Σ).
Thus the set of executed orders in Σ and Σ is at most 4k apart.
In states ¯ab, a¯b as long as we have concurrent executions in the two sequences, we know that the prices can differ by at most s2(Σ).
We now turn to the quantities that involve execution prices as opposed to volume alone - namely, average(Σ), close(Σ), lastbid(Σ) and lastask(Σ).
If we end up in state ¯a¯b, we have the one execution that is not matched and thus we charge it (pmax +s2(Σ))/volume(Σ).
Therefore, the second-highest buy order in the original  sequence is always at most the bid in the modified sequence, and the second-lowest sell order in the original sequence is always at least the ask of the modified sequence.
Otherwise the previous execution happened only in Σ at time t, in which case the two executions are within the the spread of Σ at time t (the execution of Σ from the same arguments as before, and the execution in Σ must be inside its spread in time t).
Then |average(Σ) − average(Σ )| ≤ 2(pmax + s2(Σ)) volume(Σ) + s2(Σ) where pmax is the highest execution price in Σ.
In state ¯a¯b we have that for one sequence the books  contain an additional buy order and an additional sell order.
If the volume(Σ) ≥ 2, then |close(Σ) − close(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ) Proof.
Now it remains to bound bid(Σ).
We provide the proof for the last bid; the proof for the last ask is similar.
Let bid(X), sb(X), ask(X), be the bid, the second highest buy order, and the ask of a sequence X.
5.2 Spread Bounds for k-Modifications As in the case of executed volume, we would like to extend the absolute model stability results for price-based  quantities to the case where multiple orders are modified.
Thus bid(Σ)+s2(Σ) ≥ sb(Σ)+s2(Σ) ≥ ask(Σ) = ask(Σ ) ≥ bid(Σ ).
It establishes that in highly liquid markets, where the executed volume is large and the spread small, the average price is highly stable.
By Theorem 5.6, both the ask and the bid of Σ and Σ are at most s2(Σ) apart at every time t. Since the price of the last execution is their asks (bids) at time t we are done.
Then the prices of two consecutive executions in Σ differ by at most s2(Σ).
A simple application of this lemma is the following: Let Σ be any sequence which is an -modification of Σ.
An order sequence Σ is a k-extension of Σ if Σ can be obtained by deleting any k orders in Σ .
Now since the union of the IDs of the executed orders and the order books is always identical for both sequences, this implies that the executed orders can differ by at most two.
If we have an execution only in one sequence, we either match it in state ¯a¯b, or charge it by (pmax + s2(Σ))/volume(Σ) if we end at state ¯a¯b.
Together with the fact that if an execution happens only in one sequence it implies that the order is in the spread of the second sequence as long as the sequences are 1-modification, the proof is completed.
We first provide a technical lemma regarding the prices of  consecutive executions.
For ≥ 1, if s +1(Σ) is always defined after the change, then s (Σ ) ≤ s +1(Σ).
Now recall that in state a¯b we have that the sell books are identical, and that the two buy books are identical except one different order.
Either a is the modified order, in which case we change the average price 125 difference by (pmax +s2(Σ))/volume(Σ), and this can happen only once; or a was executed before in Σ and the executions both involve an order whose limit price is a.
First suppose that the books containing the additional  orders are the original sequence Σ.
We first define the sequence ˜Σ which is the  intersection of Σ and Σ .
By the 1-Modification Theorem, we know that the books of the modified sequence and the original sequence can differ by at most one order in each book (buy and sell).
Then if edit(Σ, Σ ) ≤ k, the set of the executed orders generated by Σ and Σ differ by at most 4k.
In this subsection we consider changes in the sequence only after an initialization period, and sequences such that the second spread is always defined after the time we make a change.
124 5.1 Spread Bounds Theorem 5.4 establishes strong stability for executed  volume in the absolute model.
Now using the above lemma and by simple induction we can obtain the following theorem.
We first state the following generalization of Lemma 5.7.
If the next execution does not involve a or b then clearly we have the same execution in both Σ and Σ .
Let Σ and Σ be any absolute model order sequences.
Thus in an actual market, where single orders contain hundreds or thousands of shares, the k-spread even for large k might be quite small and close to the standard 1-spread in liquid stocks. 
Here we use the fact that the bid of the modified sequence is at least the second  highest buy order in the original sequence, due to the fact that the books are different only in one order.
If we end in state ab, ¯ab or a¯b, then every execution in states ¯ab or a¯b were matched to an execution in state ¯a¯b.
Next we provide a technical lemma which relates the (first) spread of the modified sequence to the second spread of the original sequence.
For these results, unlike executed volume, a condition must hold on Σ in order for stability to occur.
In this section we apply the 1-Modification Theorem to show strong stability properties for the absolute model.
We use sk(Σ) to denote the k-spread.
There exists Σ such that for any x ≥ 0, there is a 1-modification Σ of Σ such that average(Σ ) = average(Σ) + x.
Then the spread of Σ is bounded by s2(Σ).
The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 5.7 and  omitted.
|lastbid(Σ) − lastbid(Σ )| ≤ s2(Σ) 2.
Similarly we have that bid(Σ) ≤ bid(Σ ) since the modified buy book contains an additional order.
We begin with an examination of the executed volume.
This lemma is the key to obtain our main absolute model volume result below.
Let Σ be any sequence and Σ be any  1modification of Σ.
We use edit(Σ, Σ ) to denote the  standard edit distance between the sequences Σ and Σ - the minimal number of substitutions, insertions and deletions or orders needed to change Σ to Σ .
(Looking ahead to  Section 7, we note that in actual market data for liquid stocks, this quantity is often very small as well.)
|lastask(Σ)−lastask(Σ )| ≤ Pk =1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ) 3.
Next we deal with the case where the last execution among the two sequences occurs only in Σ.
Let Σ be any sequence and Σ be any  kmodification of Σ.
Here our results are weaker and depend on the k-spread, the distance between the kth highest buy order and the kth lowest sell order, instead of the second spread.
We next give a stability result for the closing price.
Without loss of generality we assume that the sequence with the additional orders is Σ.
Let Σ be any sequence and let Σ be any  kextension of Σ.
|close(Σ) − close(Σ )| ≤ Pk =1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ) 4.
Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any k-modification of Σ.
The proof relies on Theorem 4.1 and considers states in the stable set S. For states ab and ¯ab, we have that the bid is identical.
This condition is expressed in terms of a natural measure of the spread of the market, or the gap between the buyers and sellers.
Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any  1modification of Σ.
Similar instability results can be shown to hold for the other price-based quantities.
|lastbid(Σ) − lastbid(Σ )| ≤ Pk =1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ) 2.
Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any  1modification of Σ.
By Theorem 4.1 we know that at each stage the books differ by at most two orders.
Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any  1modification of Σ.
We note that while these bounds depend on deeper  measures of spread for more modifications, we are working in a 1-share order model.
As before, we assume that the k-spread is always defined after an initialization period.
Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any  1modification of Σ.
Let Σ be any sequence and let Σ be a  1modification of Σ.
Suppose the first execution is taken at time t; its price is bounded below by the current bid and above by the current ask.
Then the set of the executed orders (ID numbers) generated by the two sequences differs by at most 2.
Suppose that it involves a; there are two possibilities.
Then the set of the executed orders (ID numbers) generated by the two sequences differs by at most 2k.
We first deal with case where the last execution occurs in both sequences simultaneously.
In  particular, |volume(Σ) − volume(Σ )| ≤ 4k.
Then we have s2(Σ ) ≤ s +2(Σ).
