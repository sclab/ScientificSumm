Of particular note for our interests is [3], which  empirically studies the distribution of arriving limit order prices in several prominent markets.
There is also a small but growing number of works  examining market microstructure topics from a computer  science perspective, including some focused on the use of  microstructure in algorithms for optimized trade execution.
These works model traders and market-makers (who provide liquidity by offering both buy and sell quotes, and profit on the difference) by utility functions incorporating tolerance for risks of price  movement, large positions and other factors, and examine the resulting equilibrium prices and behaviors.
To our knowledge the stability properties of detailed limit order microstructure dynamics have not been previously considered.
121 On the more theoretical side, there is a rich line of work  examining what might be considered the game-theoretic  properties of limit order markets.
There is a similarly large body of empirical work on  microstructure.
As was mentioned in the Introduction, market  microstructure is an important and timely topic both in academic  finance and on Wall Street, and consequently has a large and varied recent literature.
(However, see Farmer and Joshi [6] for an example and survey of other price  dynamic stability studies.)
This work takes a view of  arriving prices analogous to our relative model, and establishes a power-law form for the resulting distributions.
Some recent papers have applied  reinforcement learning methods to trade execution using order book properties as state variables [1, 5, 10]. 
A good overview of the empirical work can be found in [7].
An excellent and comprehensive survey of results in this area can be found in [2].
[9] introduced limit order dynamics in  competitive analysis for one-way and volume-weighted average price (VWAP) trading.
Major themes include the measurement of price impacts, statistical properties of limit order books, and attempts to establish the informational value of order books [4].
Here we have space only to  summarize the main themes of this literature and to provide pointers to further readings.
Common  findings predict negative price impacts for large trades, and price effects for large inventory holdings by market-makers.
