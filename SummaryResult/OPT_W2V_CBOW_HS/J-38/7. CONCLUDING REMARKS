Representation results regarding efficiency of updates, and algorithmic results regarding how to compute the different solution concepts from updates, will both be very interesting.
Its space  requirement compares favorably with other representations discussed in the literature, and hence it serves well as a prototype to study computational complexity of coalitional game theory for a variety of problems.
An important direction to explore in the future is the question of efficiency in updating a game, and how to  evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch.
Our work on approximating the Shapley value when the aggregate value function is a non-linear function of the  attributes suggests more work to be done there as well.
Given the natural probabilistic interpretation of the Shapley value, we believe that a random sampling approach may have  significantly better theoretical guarantees. 
Positive results  obtained under this representation can easily be translated to results about other representations.
Multi-attribute coalitional games constitute a very  natural way of modeling problems of interest.
As pointed out at the end of Section 4.3, MACG is very  naturally suited for updates.
Some of these corollary results have been discussed in Sections 5 and 6.
