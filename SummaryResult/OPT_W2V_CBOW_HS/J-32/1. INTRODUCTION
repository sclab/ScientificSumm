In Section 6 we extend our algorithm so that it can be used to find a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game on an arbitrary tree.
We show that this is inevitable by constructing a family of graphical games on bounded-degree trees for which best response policies of some of the vertices have exponential size, and any  twopass algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that is similar in spirit to that of [8]) has to store almost all points of the best response policies.
The first of these papers describes a generic algorithm for this problem that can be specialized in two ways: as an algorithm that computes approximations to all Nash equilibria in time polynomial in the input size and the  approximation quality, or as an exponential-time algorithm that allows the exact computation of all Nash equilibria in G. In [9], the authors propose a modification to the latter algorithm that aims to find a single Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.
To prove Theorem 4, we use recent PPAD-completeness results for games, in particular the papers [7, 4] which show that the problem of finding Nash equilibria in graphical games of degree d (for d ≥ 3) is computationally equivalent to the problem of solving r-player normal-form games (for r ≥ 4), both of which are PPAD-complete. 
In particular, we show the following.
The main idea of [9] is that it is not  necessary to keep track of all rectangles in the best response policies; rather, at each step of the upstream pass, it is possible to select a polynomial-size subset of the corresponding policy (in [9], this subset is called a breakpoint policy), and still ensure that the  downstream pass can proceed successfully (a sufficient condition for this is that the subset of the best response policy for V stored by the  algorithm contains a continuous path from w = 0 to w = 1).
A necessary and sufficient condition for the  algorithm to proceed is that the strategy of the root is a best response to the strategies of its children and, for each child, the chosen  strategy is one of the pre-computed potential best responses to the  chosen strategy of the root.
A graphical game associates each player with a vertex of an  underlying graph G, and the payoff to that player is a function of the actions chosen by himself and his neighbours in G; if G has low degree, this is a concise way to represent a game with many players.
In Section 3 we describe a simple example for which the algorithm of [9] outputs a vector of strategies that does not constitute a Nash equilibrium of the  underlying game.
The output of this stage can be viewed as a (continuous) table T(w, v), where T(w, v) = 1 if and only if v is a potential best response to w; we refer to this table as the best response policy for V .
The computation is performed inductively: the best response policy for V is computed based on the best response policies of V "s children U1, .
In Sections 4, 5 and 6 we show how to fix the algorithm of [9] so that it always produces correct output.
In particular, we give an O(n2 ) algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game on a path of length n. Instead of storing best response policies, this algorithm stores appropriately-defined subsets, which, following [9], we call  breakpoint policies (modifying the definition as necessary).
Consider the problem of finding a Nash  equilibrium for a graphical game in which the underlying graph has  maximum degree 3 and pathwidth k. There is a constant k such that this problem is PPAD-complete.
During the upstream pass, each vertex V computes the set of its potential best responses to every mixed strategy w of its parent W ; a strategy v is a potential best response to w if 1 Note that the terminology upstream and downstream are  reversed in [8, 9] - our trees are rooted at the top.
The action of the child is chosen to be any strategy from the pre-computed potential best responses to the chosen strategy of the parent.
It is assumed that each player has two pure strategies (actions), which are denoted by 0 and 1; it follows that any mixed strategy can be represented as a single number x ∈ [0, 1], where x is the probability that the player selects 1.
Section 4 considers the case in which the underlying graph is a path of length n. For this case, we show that the number of  rectangles in each of the best response policies is O(n2 ).
The papers [8, 9] give a dynamic-programming algorithm for finding Nash equilibria in graphical games where there are two  actions per player and G is a tree.
There is an infinite family of graphical games on bounded-degree trees with pathwidth 2 such that any two-pass  algorithm for finding Nash equilibria on these trees requires  exponential time and space.
We can improve the running time of the generic algorithm  using the ideas of [9].
In Section 7, we give a complexity-theoretic intractability result for the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game on a graph with small pathwidth.
To bound the running time of this algorithm, the paper [8] shows that any best response policy can be represented as a union of an exponential number of rectangles; the polynomial time  approximation algorithm is obtained by combining this representation with a polynomial-sized grid.
By the end of the upstream pass, all children of the root have computed their best response policies.
In Section 5 we extend the results of Section 4 to general  degree2 graphs, obtaining the following theorem.
(This algorithm is a special case of the generic algorithm of [8] - we show that it runs in polynomial time when the underlying graph is a path.)
1.1 Background The generic algorithm of [8] consists of two phases which we will refer to as the upstream pass and the downstream pass; 1 the former starts at the leaves of the tree and ends at the root, while the latter starts at the root and ends at the leaves.
There is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game with two actions per player on a graph with maximum degree 2.
This question can be viewed as a  generalization of a very natural computational geometry problem - we describe it in more detail in Section 8.
It is interesting to note that the trees used in the proof of Theorem 3 have pathwidth 2, that is, they are very close to being paths.
1.2 Our Results One of the main contributions of our paper is to show that the algorithm proposed by [9] is incorrect.
In the beginning of the downstream pass, the root selects its  strategy and informs its children about its choice.
Theorem 4 limits the extent to which we can exploit path-like properties of the underlying graph, in order to find Nash equilibria.
[9] as a succinct representation of games with a large number of players.
There is an O(n2 ) algorithm that finds a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game with two actions per player on an n-vertex path.
The equilibrium then propagates  downstream, with each vertex selecting its children"s actions.
Even when the tree has bounded degree, the running time can be  exponential.
100 there is a Nash equilibrium in the graphical game downstream of V (inclusive) given that W plays w (for a more technical definition, the reader is referred to Section 2).
This gives us an O(n3 ) algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium, and for  computing a representation of all Nash equilibria.
This does not quite work, as we show in Section 3, though it introduces a useful idea.
The generic algorithm does not address the problem of representing the best response policy; in fact, the most important difference between the two instantiations of the generic algorithm described in [8] is in their approach to this issue.
We prove the following theorem.
There is an O(n3 ) algorithm that computes a representation of all Nash equilibria of such a game.
It also selects a  strategy for each child.
Graphical games were introduced in the papers of Kearns et al.
It is an open question whether our algorithm runs in polynomial time for graphs of pathwidth 1.
The classical normal form (or  matrix form) representation has a size that is exponential in the number of players, making it unsuitable for large-scale distributed games.
We obtain the following theorem THEOREM 1.
THEOREM 3.
THEOREM 2.
THEOREM 4.
