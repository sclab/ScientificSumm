As v = 0, 1, V is, in fact, indifferent between playing 0 and 1, which is only possible if w = f(vj−1).
Since w = f(u), V is indifferent between  playing 0 and 1; in particular, it can play v. Therefore, if we define vj+1 = w, the vector of strategies (v1, .
Moreover, if v is a V -event point of B(W, V ), then v is a  Vevent point of B(V, U) (this includes the cases v = 0 and v = 1, as 0 and 1 are V -event points of B(V, U)) and if w is a W -event point of B(W, V ), then either w = 0 or w = 1 or there exists some u ∈ [0, 1] such that w = f(u) and u is a U-event point of B(V, U).
, m. We say that a breakpoint policy is valid if v0 = 0, vm = 1, and ˆB(V, U) ⊆ B(V, U).
Similarly to the previous case, we can show that B(W, V )∩[0, 1]×(0, 1) consists of the rectangle {α}×[0, 1] and at most 2j + 2 rectangles of the form [0, 1]×IV , where each IV corresponds to a connected component of B(V, U)|U=−B0/B1 .
In this case 0 ∈ pbrV (w) for some w ∈ [0, 1] if and only if there exists a u ∈ pbrU (0) such that u ≤ −A0/A1: if no such u exists, whenever V plays 0 either U"s response is not in pbrU (0) or V can improve its payoff by playing 1.
Suppose that U plays some u ∈ pbrU (v), w = f(u) satisfies w ∈ [0, 1], and W plays w. There exists a vector of strategies v1, .
For any set A ⊆ [0, 1]2 that is represented as a union of a finite number of rectangles, we say that a point u ∈ [0, 1] on the U-axis is a U-event point of A if u = 0 or u = 1 or A contains a rectangle of the form IV × IU and u is an endpoint of IU ; V -event points are defined similarly.
We use induction on j to show that for each Vj the statement of the theorem holds and, additionally, each B(Vj , Vj−1) has at most 2j + 4 event points.
Together, Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 completely describe the set B(W, V ): we have B(W, V ) = ˆf(0) ∪ ˆf(B(V, U)) ∪ ˆf(1) [0, 1]2 .
For any v ∈ V, we have B(W, V )|V =v = [0, 1]: no matter what W plays, as long as U is playing −A0/A1, V is content to play v. On the other hand, for any v ∈ (0, 1) \ V we have B(W, V )|V =v = ∅: when V plays v, U can only respond with u = −A0/A1, in which case V can benefit from switching to one of the pure strategies.
Fix an arbitrary v ∈ (0, 1).
Observe that any valid breakpoint policy ˆB(V, U) can be viewed as a continuous 1-1 mapping γ(t) = (γv(t), γu(t)), γ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]2 , where γ(0) = (0, u1), γ(1) = (1, um) and there exist some t0 = 0, t1, .
104 v u v u* 1 f(0) f(a)f(b) f(1) a b (0, 0) w v 2 v (0, 0) 1 1 1 v 2 v 1 1 Figure 4: f is increasing on (−∞, u∗ ) and (u∗ , +∞).
If u∗ ∈ [u1, u2], the function f(·) is continuous on [u1, u2] and hence ˆf(R) = [fmin, fmax]×[v1, v2], where fmin = min{f(u1), f(u2)}, fmax = max{f(u1), f(u2)}, i.e., in this case ˆf(R) ∩ [0, 1]2 consists of a single rectangle.
A breakpoint policy ˆB(V, U) for a vertex U whose parent is V is a non-self-intersecting curve of the form X1 ∪ Y1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ym−1 ∪ Xm, where Xi = [vi−1, vi]×{ui}, Yi = {vi}×[ui, ui+1] and ui, vi ∈ [0, 1] for i = 0, .
Then it must be the case that for any u0 ∈ pbrU (0) either f(u0) < w and Ru0 = (−∞, f(u0)]×{0} or f(u0) > w and Ru0 = [f(u0), +∞)×{0}.
Define ˆf(0) = ∪u∈pbrU (0)Ru, where Ru = ´ [f(u), +∞)×{0} if B(u) > 0, (−∞, f(u)]×{0} if B(u) < 0. and ˆf(1) = ∪u∈pbrU (1)Ru, where Ru = ´ [f(u), +∞)×{1} if B(u) < 0, (−∞, f(u)]×{1} if B(u) > 0.
To simplify the base case, we modify the graphical game by  appending a dummy vertex V0 to the beginning of the path: the only neighbour of V0 is V1, the payoffs of V0 are always equal to 0, and the payoffs of all other vertices (including V1) are the same as in the original game.
We show that in this case the best response policy for each vertex can be represented as a union of a polynomial number of rectangles, where a rectangle is defined by a pair of closed intervals (IV , IU ) and consists of all points in IV × IU ; it may be the case that one or both of the intervals IV and IU consists of a single point.
While it is not always possible to construct a breakpoint policy as defined in [9], we show how to modify this definition so as to ensure that a breakpoint policy always exists; moreover, we prove that for a path graph, the breakpoint policy of any vertex can be stored in a data structure whose size is linear in the number of descendants this vertex has.
Theorem 6 shows that one can inductively compute valid  breakpoint policies for all vertices on the path; the proof of this theorem can be found in the full version of this paper [6].
Otherwise, the vertex V is indifferent between 0 and 1 if and only if A1 = 0 and u = −A0/A1.
Also, similarly to the previous case it follows that B(W, V ) consists of at most 2j + 4 < (j + 4)2 rectangles.
For any A ⊆ [0, 1]2 , we define a function ˆfV by ˆfV (A) = {(f(u), v) | (v, u) ∈ A}; note that ˆfV maps subsets of [0, 1]2 to subsets of R×[0, 1].
For any (w, v) ∈ [0, 1]×(0, 1) we have (w, v) ∈ B(W, V ) if and only if there exists a u ∈ [0, 1] such that (v, u) ∈ B(V, U) and w = f(u).
As ˆf(B(V, U)) = Ë R⊂B(V,U) ˆf(R), it follows that ˆf(B(V, U)) consists of at most (j + 3)2 + 2j + 2 rectangles.
Now, suppose that j > 0, set V = Vj and let U = Vj−1 and W = Vj+1 be the vertices that precede and follow V , respectively.
Therefore, the set B(W, V ) consists of at most 2j + 4 ≤ (j + 4)2 rectangles: B(W, V ) ∩ [0, 1]×(0, 1) = [0, 1]×V contributes at most 2j + 2 rectangles, and each of the sets B(W, V )|V =0 and B(W, V )|V =1 contributes at most one rectangle.
In both cases, when V plays 0, U plays u0, and V plays w, the inequality between f(u0) and w is equivalent to P0 < P1 , i.e., V would benefit from switching to 1.
Note that for any such  vector we have vj−1 ∈ pbrU (0).
Therefore, if B1u∗ + B0 > 0 for some u∗ ∈ pbrU (0), then B(W, V )|V =0 contains [α, +∞) ∩ [0, 1] and if B1u∗∗ + B0 < 0 for some u∗∗ ∈ pbrU (0), then B(W, V )|V =0 contains [−∞, α] ∩ [0, 1]; if both u∗ and u∗∗ exist, B(W, V )|V =0 = [0, 1].
and ˆf([v1, v2]×(u∗ , u2]) = (−∞, f(u2)]×[v1, v2], i.e., in this case ˆf(R) ∩ [0, 1]2 consists of at most two rectangles.
4.1 Finding a Single Nash Equilibrium in O(n2 ) Time The upper bound on the running time of our algorithm is tight, at least assuming the straightforward implementation, in which each B(Vj+1, Vj) is stored as a union of rectangles: it is not hard to construct an example in which the size of B(Vj+1, Vj) is Ω(j2 ).
Observe that whenever w = f(u) and u, w ∈ [0, 1], V is indifferent between playing 0 and 1.
Since each V -event point of B(W, V ) is a  Vevent point of B(V, U) and B(W, V ) has at most 3 W -event points (0, 1, and α), its total number of event points is at most 2j + 3 < 2j +4.
We conclude that B(W, V ) can be represented as a union of at most (j + 3)2 + 2j + 6 < (j + 4)2 rectangles.
For any w ∈ [0, 1], we have (w, 0) ∈ ˆf(0) if and only if 0 ∈ pbrV (w) and (w, 1) ∈ ˆf(1) if and only if 1 ∈ pbrV (w).
Conversely, if 0 ∈ pbrV (w) for some w ∈ [0, 1], there  exists a vector (v1, .
The payoffs to V are described by a 2×2×2 matrix P: Pxyz is the payoff that V receives when U plays x, V plays y, and W plays z, where x, y, z ∈ {0, 1}.
, vj+1) will satisfy the conditions in the definition of potential best response, i.e., we have v ∈ pbrV (w).
, vj−1, vj = 0, vj+1 = w) such that for each Vk, k ≤ j, Vk plays vk, and this strategy is a best response to the strategies of Vk"s neighbours.
Since f(·) is continuous on [u1, u∗ ) and (u∗ , u2], it is easy to see that ˆf([v1, v2]×[u1, u∗ )) = [f(u1), +∞)×[v1, v2] 2 The case B1 = 0 causes no special problems.
As explained in Section 3, we can use a valid breakpoint policy instead of the best response policy during the downstream pass, and still guarantee that in the end, we will output a Nash equilibrium.
In this case, one can define the indifference function f(·) as f(u) = A(u) B(u) = A1u+A0 B1u+B0 , where A(u) and B(u) never turn into zero simultaneously.
Similarly, its total number of event points is at most 2j + 4: the only W -event points are 0 and 1, each V -event point of B(W, V ) is a V -event point of B(V, U), and there are at most 2j + 2 of them.
It remains to show that B(W, V ) can be represented as a union of at most (j + 4)2 rectangles, has at most 2j + 4 event points, and can be computed in O(j2 ) time.
Therefore, when U plays u0 and W plays w, w ≥ f(u0), V prefers to play 0; as u0 ∈ pbrU (u), it follows that 0 ∈ pbrV (w).
To complete the description of B(W, V ), it remains to analyze the cases v = 0 and v = 1.
, vj−1, vj = v, vj+1 = w such that for each Vk, k ≤ j, its strategy is a best response to its neighbours" strategies.
The case limu→u∗− f(u) = −∞ is similar.
Observe that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the number of connected components of [0, 1]×{u} ∩ A is at most the number of V -event points of A.
Conversely, suppose v ∈ pbrV (w) for some w ∈ [0, 1], v = 0, 1.
Hence, B(W, V ) has at most 2j + 4 event points.
Suppose that U plays 1 with probability u and W plays 1 with probability w. Then V "s expected payoff from playing 0 is P0 =(1−u)(1−w)P000+(1−u)wP001+u(1−w)P100+uwP101, while its expected payoff from playing 1 is P1 =(1−u)(1−w)P010+(1−u)wP011+u(1−w)P110+uwP111.
, vj−1 = u, vj = v such that for each Vk, k < j, its strategy is a best response to its  neighbours" strategies.
Consider an arbitrary u0 ∈ pbrU (0).
• B1u + B0 ≡ 0, A1 = αB1, A0 = αB0 for some α ∈ R. In this case, V is indifferent between 0 and 1 if and only if w = α, or B1 = 0 and u = −B0/B1 = −A0/A1.
, n, the set B(Vj , Vj−1) can be represented as a disjoint union of at most (j + 4)2 rectangles.
Lemma 1 describes the situations when V is indifferent between playing 0 and playing 1.
If P 0 > P1 , V strictly prefers to play 0, if P0 < P1 , V strictly prefers to play 1, and if P0 = P1 , V is indifferent, i.e., can play any (mixed) strategy.
Our solution is based on the idea of [9], i.e., working with subsets of the best response policies rather than the best response policies themselves; following [9], we will refer to such subsets as breakpoint policies.
The argument for the case B(u0) < 0 is similar.
Choose u = vj−1; by construction, u ∈ pbrU (v).
Now, suppose that R is intersected by the line [0, 1]×{u∗ }; as was noted earlier, there are at most 2j+2 such rectangles.
2 Consider an arbitrary rectangle R = [v1, v2]×[u1, u2] ⊆ B(V, U).
If B(u0) > 0, for u = u0 the inequality P0 ≥ P1 is equivalent to w ≥ f(u0).
For any j = 1, .
If also A1 = 0, A0 = 0, clearly, B(W, V ) = [0, 1]2 , and the statement of the theorem is trivially true.
For any V = Vj, one can find in polynomial time a valid breakpoint policy ˆB(W, V ) that consists of at most 2j + 1 segments. 
Suppose that limu→u∗− f(u) = +∞; as f(·) is a fractional linear function, this implies that limu→u∗+ f(u) = −∞ and also f(u1) > f(u2).
Note that we do not require that vi ≤ vi+1 or ui ≤ ui+1; consequently, in any argument involving breakpoint policies, all segments are to be treated as directed segments.
The set B(W, V )|V =1 can be described in a similar manner.
Similarly, B(W, V )|V =1 is equal to either [0, 1] or ∅, depending on pbrU (1).
By the inductive hypothesis, B(V, U) has at most 2j + 2 event points; as at least two of these are U-event points, it has at most 2j V -event points.
Since P0 and P1 are linear in w and u, there exist some constants A1, A0, B1, and B0 that depend on the matrix P, but not on u and w, such that P0 − P1 = w(B1u + B0) − (A1u + A0).
For j = 0, we have B(V1, V0) = [0, 1]2 , so the statement of the theorem is trivially true.
By the inductive hypothesis, V consists of at most 2(j − 1) + 4 segments and isolated points.
Then there exists a vector of strategies v1, .
The vertex V prefers to play 0 if A1 > 0 and u ≤ −A0/A1, or A1 < 0 and u ≥ −A0/A1, or 103 A1 = 0 and A0 < 0.
For completeness, set u∗ to be any value outside of [0, 1] in this case.
Also, it is easy to see that both ˆf(0) and ˆf(1) consist of at most 2 line segments each.
Furthermore, V prefers to play 0 if B1u + B0 > 0 and w ≥ α or B1u + B0 < 0 and w ≤ α.
Let V = {v | v ∈ (0, 1), −A0/A1 ∈ pbrU (v)}.
In this case, P0 > P1 if and only if A1u + A0 < 0.
Therefore, either B(W, V )|V =0 = [0, 1] or B(W, V )|V =0 = ∅.
Moreover, given such representation of B(Vj , Vj−1), one can  compute a representation of B(Vj+1, Vj) in time O(j2 ).
, Vn}, and its edge set is {(Vj , Vj+1) | j = 1, .
By way of contradiction, assume (w, 0) ∈ Ë u∈pbrU (0) Ru.
However, to fully characterize B(W, V ), we also need to know when V prefers a pure strategy.
The argument for ˆf(1) is similar.
We will sometimes abuse notation by referring to ˆB(V, U) as a collection of segments Xi, Yi rather than their union.
Assume for now that A1 > 0; the other two cases can be treated similarly.
In this section, we focus on the case when the underlying graph is a path, i.e., its vertex set is {V1, .
, n − 1}.
, t2m−2 = 1 such that {γ(t) | t2k ≤ t ≤ t2k+1} = Xk+1, {γ(t) | t2k+1 ≤ t ≤ t2k+2} = Yk+1.
LEMMA 1.
LEMMA 2.
(1) Depending on the values of A1, A0, B1, and B0, we subdivide the rest of the proof into the following cases.
The O(j2 ) bound on the running time in Theorem 5 follows from our description of the algorithm.
• B1 = 0, B0 = 0.
Set u∗ = −B0/B1.
In this section, we show that this problem can be solved in quadratic time, thus obtaining a proof of Theorem 1.
The O(n3 ) bound on the overall running time for finding a Nash equilibrium (and a representation of all Nash equilibria) follows.
Sometimes we drop the subscript V when it is clear from the context.
However, in some cases it is not necessary to represent all Nash equilibria; rather, the goal is to find an arbitrary equilibrium of the game.
