For an odd-length cycle all other vj "s are derivable from those solutions, and if a fully mixed Nash equilibrium exists, all the vj should turn out to be real numbers in the range (0, 1).
For the second search, note that if Vi plays a mixed strategy, then vi+1 and vi−1 satisfy an equation of the form vi+1 = (A0 + A1vi−1)/(B0 + B1vi−1).
Since all vertices in the cycle play mixed strategies, we have vi+3 = (A0 +A1vi+1)/(B0 +B1vi+1).
, Vk (in cyclic order), we make two separate searches for a Nash equilibrium: first we search for a Nash equilibrium where some vertex plays a pure strategy, then we search for a fully mixed Nash equilibrium, where all vertices play mixed strategies.
MAXIMUM DEGREE 2 In this section we show how the algorithm for paths can be  applied to solve a game on any graph whose vertices have degree at most 2.
For an even-length  cycle, we obtain two quadratic equations, one for vi and another for 105 vi+1, and we can in the same way test whether any solutions to these yield values for the other vj , all of which lie in (0, 1).
and ultimately vi itself to obtain a quadratic  equation (for vi) that is simple to derive from the payoffs in the game.
Choose any vertex Vi.
Put vi = b; apply the downstream pass For each vertex, Vj, keep track of all possible mixed strategies vj 5.
A graph having maximum degree 2 is, of course, a union of paths and cycles.
The values for vi that may occur in a Nash equilibrium are those for which all dependent vj values lie in (0, 1); the latter condition is easy to check by computing the image of the interval (0, 1) under respective fractional linear transforms. 
If the quadratic equation is trivial, there is potentially a  continuum of fully-mixed equilibria.
Since each connected component can be  handled independently, to obtain a proof of Theorem 2, we only need to show how to deal with cycles.
Check whether Vi+1 has any responses that are consistent with vi = b; if so we have a Nash equilibrium.
Let P be the path (Vi+1, Vi+2 .
Let payoff to Vi+1 be based on putting vi = b (so it depends only on vi+1 and vi+2.)
(Otherwise, there is no Nash equilibrium of the desired form.)
For i ≤ k let vi denote the probability that Vi plays 1.
Given a cycle with vertices V1, .
If the equation is non-trivial it has at most 2 solutions in (0, 1).

We can express vi in terms of vi+2, then vi+4, vi+6 etc.

For each i ∈ {1, .
Composing the two linear fractional transforms, we obtain vi+3 = (A0 +A1 vi−1)/(B0 +B1 vi−1).
The first search can be done as follows.
