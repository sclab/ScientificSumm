118 Figure 8: Performance of models when varying percentage of aggregating traders Figure 8 shows how the various models are affected by a change in the percentage of aggregating traders, holding problem size fixed.8 Due to the integrality constraints, we could not test available  algorithms specialized for network-flow problems on our test  problems.
Unlike the previous model we allow fractional flow for this case, representing the traded fraction of the buyer"s total quantity.7 We tested all three models on random data in the form of  bipartite graphs encoding MMP solutions.
When most of the traders are aggregating, problems of larger sizes can be solved quickly.
This new model outperformed our other models on most problem instances, exceptions being those where aggregating traders constitute a vast majority (at least 80%).
In our experiments, each trader has a maximum quantity uniformly distributed over [30, 70], and minimum quantity uniformly distributed from zero to maximal quantity.

We found that in addition to the problem size (in terms of number of traders), the number of aggregating traders plays a crucial role in determining complexity.

Thus, we cannot fully evaluate the potential gain attributable to network structure.
Each buyer/seller pair is selected as matching with  probability 0.75, with matches assigned a surplus uniformly distributed over [10, 70].
B1 is a buyer in AD, B2 ∈ AI, B3 ∈ NI, B4 ∈ ND.

Whereas the size of the problem is defined by the number of traders on each side, the problem complexity depends on the product |B| × |S|.
This was consistent throughout the problem sizes, including the smaller sizes for which the speedup is not visually apparent on the chart. 
One Side means that one side aggregates and divisible, and the other side is restrictive.
This new model (Figure 4) has a single node for each non  aggregating trader, with a single-unit arc designating a match to another non-aggregating trader.

We also look to compare the performance of a straightforward integer program as in (4) with an integer program that is based on the  network formulations developed here.
For example, our IP model solved instances with 600 buyers and 500 sellers, where 90% of them are aggregating, in less than two minutes.
Batch means that traders may submit batch sizes.
Rather than treat non-aggregating traders as a special case, the new model takes advantage of the single-unit nature of non-aggregating trades (treating the aggregating traders as a special case).

First, we seek a general idea of the sizes and types of  clearing problems that can be solved under given time constraints.
Model NW 2 provided speedups of a factor of 4-10 over the model SW.
An aggregating trader has a node for each potential match, connected (via y arcs) to a mutual source node.
However, the model we built based on the insight from the network structure clearly provided a significant speedup, even without using a special-purpose algorithm.
Since we used CPLEX, a  commercial optimization tool, the second objective could be achieved to the extent that CPLEX can take advantage of network structure present in a model.

These results motivated us to develop a new network model.
The tests depicted in Figures 5-7 are for the worst case |B| = |S|, with each data point averaged over six samples.
V 1 is a seller in AD, V 2 ∈ AI, V 4 ∈ ND.
7 Traded quantity remains integer.
When the aggregating ratio was reduced to 80% for the same data, solution time was just under five minutes.
We approach the experimental aspect of this work with two  objectives.

In the figures, the direct IP (4) is designated SW, our first network model (Figure 2) NW, and our revised network model (Figure 4) NW 2.
The g values represent arc gains, and W values represent weights.
