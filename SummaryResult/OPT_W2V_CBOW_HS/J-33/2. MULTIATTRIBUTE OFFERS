For example, one way to specify a trade (buy) offer set would be to describe a set of configurations and quantities, along with the maximal payment one would exchange for each (x, q) specified.
Suppose a  particular trade is offered in the same context (set of additional trades, T) with two different sellers, s and s .
The superscript B distinguishes the buyer"s  willingnessto-pay function from, a seller"s willingness to accept, ˆuS i (x, q),  defined as the minimum payment seller i will accept for q units of configuration x.
Agent i"s willingness to pay for quantity q of configuration x in the  context of other trades T is given by ˆuB i (x, q; T) = max π s.t.
To specify a trade offer set, a bidder directly specifies a set of willing trades, along with any regularity conditions (e.g.,  divisibility, anonymity) that implicitly extend the set.
2.3 Willingness to Pay An agent"s offer trade set implicitly defines the agent"s  willingness to pay for any given configuration and quantity.
Let T denote the set of all possible trades.
Agent i"s offer is  divisible down to q iff ∀q < q < q.
Henceforth, for expository simplicity, we present all definitions with respect to buyers only, leaving the definition for sellers as understood.
If OC i is either non aggregating, or exhibits linear pricing, then ˆuB i (x, q; T) = ˆuB i (x, q). 
Note that linear pricing assumes divisibility down to qi(x).
Agent i"s offer allows seller aggregation iff in all such cases, {(x, q , i, s, π ), (x, q − q , i, s , π − π )} ∪ T ∈ OC i .
Agent i"s offer allows configuration aggregation iff in all such cases (and analogously when it is a seller), {(x, q , i, ∗, q q π), (x , q − q , i, ∗, q − q q π )} ∪ T ∈ OC i .
2.1 Basic Definitions The distinguishing feature of a multiattribute auction is that the goods are defined by vectors of attributes, x = (x1, .
Given linear pricing, we can define the unit willingness to pay, ˆui(x) = ˆui(x, ¯qi(x))/¯qi(x), and take ˆui(x, q) = qˆui(x) for all qi(x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi(x).
We also assume free disposal, which dictates that for all i, q > q > 0, (x, q , i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i , (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q , b, i, π) ∈ OT i .
However, classes of bundles formed by  partner or configuration aggregation are highly regular, covering only a specific type of bundle formed by splitting a desired quantity across configurations.
That is, {(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ T ∈ OC i ∧ {(x, q, i, s , π)} ∪ T ∈ OC i .
Agent i"s offers exhibit configuration parity iff qi(x) > 0 ∧ qi(x ) > 0 ⇒ qi(x) = qi(x ) ∧ ¯qi(x) = ¯qi(x ).
Note that when offers are divisible, it suffices to specify one offer corresponding to the maximal quantity one is willing to trade for any given configuration, trading partner, and per-unit payment (called the price).
The full trade offer set is then defined by the closure of this direct set with respect to payment monotonicity, free disposal, and any applicable  divisibility assumptions.
Suppose agent i offers, in the same context, the same quantity of two (not necessarily different) configurations, x and x .
Agent i"s  minimum trade quantity for configuration x is given by qi(x) = min q s.t.
It is useful to define a special case where all configurations are offered in the same quantity range.
For convenience, we use the notation xt to denote the configuration associated with trade t (and similarly for other  elements of t).
Agent i"s willingness to pay for quantity q of configuration x is given by ˆuB i (x, q) = max π s.t.
Agent i"s offers exhibit linear pricing iff for all qi(x) ≤ q ≤ ¯qi(x), ˆui(x, q) = q ¯qi(x) ˆui(x, ¯qi(x)).
One possibility is disallowing any  aggregation.
When the agent has no offers involving x, we take qi(x) = ¯qi(x) = 0.
That is, for π > π > 0, (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, i, s, π ) ∈ OT i , (x, q, b, i, π ) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i .
Agent i"s offer is all-or-none (AON) iff (x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ∧ (x, q , i, s, π ) ∈ OT i ⇒ [q = q ∨ π = π ].
(x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇒ (x, q , i, s, q q π) ∈ OT i .
Without loss of generality, we restrict each trade set T ∈ OC i to include at most one trade for any combination of configuration and trading partner (multiple such trades are equivalent to one net trade aggregating the quantities and payments).
Under configuration parity we drop the arguments from trade  quantity bounds, yielding the constants ¯q and q which apply to all offers.
For a set of trades T, we denote by Ti that subset of T involving agent i (i.e., b = i or s = i).
Trade t takes the form t = (x, q, b, s, π), signifying that agent b buys q > 0 units of configuration x from seller s, for  payment π > 0.
The agent"s maximum trade quantity for x is ¯qi(x) = max q s.t.
Note that the conditions for agents in the role of buyers and sellers are analogous.
A bid expresses an agent"s willingness to participate in trades.
The definition above specifies arbitrary divisibility.
That is, {(x, q, i, ∗, π)} ∪ T ∈ OC i ∧ {(x , q, i, ∗, π )} ∪ T ∈ OC i .
Our bids directly specify part of the agent"s trade offer set, and include further directives  controlling how this can be extended to the full trade and combination offer sets.
We specify the semantics of a bid in terms of offer sets.
(x, q, i, s, π) ∈ OT i ⇔ (x, q, i, s , π) ∈ OT i ∧ (x, q, b, i, π) ∈ OT i ⇔ (x, q, b , i, π) ∈ OT i .
However, since the  outcome of the auction is a set of trades, several of which may involve agent i, we must in general consider willingness to engage in trade combinations.
Agent i"s offer exhibits non-aggregation iff OC i = ONA i .
A configuration is a particular attribute vector, x ∈ X = Qm j=1 Xj .
Allowing agents" bids to comprise offers from both buyer and seller perspectives is also straightforward.
We employ the shorthand divisible to mean divisible down to 0.
The outcome of the auction is a set of bilateral trades.
Let OT i ⊆ Ti denote agent i"s trade offer set.
In other words, we may create new trade offer combinations by splitting the common trade (quantity and payment, not necessarily proportionately) between the two sellers.
In general, an agent"s willingness to pay may depend on a context of other trades the agent is engaging in.
{(x, q, i, s, π)} ∪ Ti ∈ OC i .
Intuitively, this represents the trades in which i is willing to participate.
Accordingly, we introduce the combination offer set of agent i, OC i ⊆ 2Ti .
DEFINITION 1 (DIVISIBLE OFFER).
Because omitting trading partner qualifications simplifies the  exposition, we generally assume in the following that all offers are anonymous unless explicitly specified otherwise.
We use the symbol ˆu to recognize that willingness to pay can be viewed as a proxy for the agent"s utility function, measured in  monetary units.
Note that combination offer sets can accommodate offerings of configuration bundles.
(x, q , i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i .
We require in general that OC i ⊇ ONA i .
In that event, it may omit the partner element from trades directly specified in its offer set, and simply assert that its offer is anonymous.
In many cases, the agent will be indifferent with respect to  different trading partners.
The key question is to what extent the agent is willing to aggregate deals across  configurations or trading partners.
(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i .
It would  likewise be possible to define divisibility with respect to integers, or to any given finite granularity.
DEFINITION 8 (TRADE QUANTITY BOUNDS).
Agent i"s offer is anonymous iff ∀s, s , b, b .
(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i .
2.2 Specifying Offer Sets A fully expressive bid language would allow specification of  arbitrary combination offer sets.
At the extreme of indivisibility are all-or-none offers.
An assertion that offers are divisible entails further implicit  members in the trade offer set.
(x, q, i, ∗, π) ∈ OT i ∧ ¬∃q < q.
DEFINITION 11 (WILLINGNESS TO PAY IN CONTEXT).
The no-aggregation  combinations are given by ONA i = {∅} ∪ {{t} | t ∈ OT i }.
We assume anonymity to avoid conditioning our definitions on trading partner.
DEFINITION 7 (WILLINGNESS TO PAY).
We employ the wild-card symbol ∗ in place of an agent identifier to indicate that any agent is acceptable.
An explicit set of trades in the offer set generally entails inclusion of many more implicit trades.
DEFINITION 2 (AON OFFER).
We next consider the specification of combination offer sets.
DEFINITION 5 (PARTNER AGGREGATION).
A more flexible policy is to allow aggregation across trading partners, keeping configuration constant.
In some cases, it might be reasonable to form combinations by aggregating different configurations.
DEFINITION 6 (CONFIGURATION AGGREGATION).
DEFINITION 9 (CONFIGURATION PARITY).
We omit the superscript where the distinction is inessential or clear from context.
This description could be by enumeration, or any available means of defining such a mapping.
DEFINITION 10 (LINEAR PRICING).
We assume payment monotonicity, which means that agents always prefer more money.
We instead consider a more limited class which, while restrictive, still captures most forms of  multiattribute bidding proposed in the literature.
Extending to the non-anonymous case is conceptually straightforward.
, xm), xj ∈ Xj .
This is quite restrictive compared to the general combinatorial case.
