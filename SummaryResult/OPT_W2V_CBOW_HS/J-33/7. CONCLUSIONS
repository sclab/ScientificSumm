The extent to which the space of feasible mechanisms may be quantified a priori will facilitate the search for such exchanges in the full mechanism design problem.
In this work, we investigate the space of two-sided multiattribute auctions, focusing on the relationship between constraints on the offers traders can express through bids, and the resulting  computational problem of determining an optimal set of trades.
The implementation and deployment of market exchanges  requires the development of bidding languages, information feedback policies, and clearing algorithms that are suitable for the target  domain, while paying heed to the incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms.
Based on these results, we developed network flow models for the overall clearing problem, which facilitate  classification of problem versions by computational complexity, and provide guidance for developing solution algorithms and relaxing bidding constraints. 
For multiattribute exchanges, the space of feasible such mechanisms is constrained by computational limitations  imposed by the clearing process.
Our key technical results identify sets of conditions under which the  overall matching problem can be separated into first identifying  optimal pairwise trades and subsequently optimizing combinations of those trades.
We  developed a formal semantic framework for characterizing expressible offers, and introduced some basic classes of restrictions.
