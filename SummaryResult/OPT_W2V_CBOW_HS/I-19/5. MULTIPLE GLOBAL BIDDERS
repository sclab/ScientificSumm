We now consider the best response strategies when both  local and global bidders participate and each auction contains the same number of local bidders.
7 Note that the number of possible allocations still increases with the number of auctions and global bids.
Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 .
This is measured as the variance of an actual best-response bid over different iterations, and then taking the average over the discrete bidder valuations.
Thus, our simulation can be used as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the  optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect a combination of local and global bidders. 
5.1 The Global Bidder"s Expected Utility In order to find a global bidder"s best response, we first need to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the local bidders.
Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidder"s valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric  equilibria.
In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders.
A typical analytical approach is to find the  symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally  deviate from the chosen strategy.
To this end, Figure 3 shows the average variance of the best response strategies.

Now, the expected utility is the average expected utility over all possible assignments and is given by: U(B, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈B (1 − ˜Gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜Gωi (b) = G(b) · Ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the probability of winning auction i, given that each global  bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy.
The analysis of this problem is complex, however, as the optimal bidding  strategy of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global bidders.
The local bidders are static and bid their valuation as before.
Moreover, if the number of global bidders is increased even further, a bifurcation occurs in the equal-bid state similar to the case without local bidders.
5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions.
The same result is observed when the number of global bidders is less than the number of auctions.
To conclude, even though a theoretical analysis proves  difficult in case of several global bidders, we can approximate a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium for specific settings using a discrete simulation in case the system consists of both local and global bidders.
The results show that the principal conclusions in the case of a single global bidder carry over to the case of multiple global bidders.
As can be seen from this figure, local bidders have a large stabilising effect on the global bidder strategies.
In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.
Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, .
The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.
Each valuation occurs with equal probability, equivalent to a  uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case.
Whereas so far we assumed a single global bidder, in this section we consider a setting where multiple global bidders interact with one  another and with local bidders as well.
This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.
If this should result in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding  strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium.
These  functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next  iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.
Each such assignment ω ∈ Ω is a (M, Ng) matrix, where each entry ωi,j identifies the function used by global bidder j in auction i.
As shown in Figure 2, a similar fluctuation is observed when the number of global bidders increases relative to the number of auctions.
However, we assume that the assignment of functions to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion without replacement (i.e., each function is assigned exactly once by each global bidder).
A  bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid  levels.
The best response is then again to bid  truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.
This  oc6 This approach is similar to an alternating-move  bestresponse process with pure strategies [4], although here we consider symmetric strategies within a setting where an  opponent"s best response depends on its valuation.
That is, the optimal strategy is to bid  positive in all auctions (as long as there are at least as many  bidders as auctions).
We note that the results converge after only a few iterations.
Note that the cardinality of Ω, denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng .
However, by merging all utility-equivalent permutations, we significantly increase computation speed, allowing experiments with  relatively large numbers of auctions and bidders to be performed (e.g., a single iteration with 50 auctions and 10 global bidders takes roughly 30 seconds on a 3.00 Ghz PC).
The results reported here are based on the following  settings.8 In order to emphasize that the valuations are  discrete, we use integer values ranging from 1 to 1000.
The simulation works by iteratively finding the best response to the optimal  bidding strategies in the previous iteration.
That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.
Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the  utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the  number of auctions and global bidders increases.
As argued in section 3.2, we expect a real-world market to exhibit a mix of global and local bidders.
This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .
curs since global bidders randomise over auctions, and thus they cannot coordinate and choose to bid high in different auctions.
These results are very robust to changes to the auction settings and the parameters of the simulation.
Here, G(b) is the probability of  winning an auction with only local bidders as described in  Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before.
Let Ω denote the set of all  possible assignments.
As a result, the best response strategy approximates a pure  symmetric Nash equilibrium.
The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.
5.3 The Results First, we describe the results with no local bidders.
The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all  auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.
Here, the variance is a gauge for the amount of fluctuation and thus the instability of the strategy.
The initial set of functions can play an important role in the experiments.
For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state.
The  fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.
8 We also performed experiments with different precision, other valuation distributions, and dynamic local bidders.
Furthermore, a similar bifurcation point is observed.
However, the bids in the equal-bid state (state 2 in Figure 2), as well as the low bids of the other state, increase.
As a result, there exists no stable solution.
Therefore, to  ensure our results are robust, experiments are repeated with different random initial functions.
The errorbars show the (small) standard deviations.
We find that the prinicipal conclusions generalise to these  different settings, and therefore we omit the results to avoid repetitiveness.
Due to the complexity of the problem, however, here we combine a computational  simulation approach with analytical results.
