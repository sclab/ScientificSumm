On the other hand, as a result of the uncertainty concerning the actual number of bidders, a global bidder is more likely to win multiple items (we confirmed this  analytically).
In the case of dynamic bidders, however, the effect of a global bidder depends on the number of sellers.
Note that a degree of inefficiency is inherent to a  multiauction market with only local bidders [2].9 For example, if there are two auctions selling one item each, and the two bidders with the highest valuations both bid locally in the same auction, then the bidder with the second-highest value does not obtain the good.
However, as the number of local bidders increase, this is less likely to happen.
The experiments are repeated 5000 times for each run to obtain an accurate mean value, and the final  average results and standard deviations are taken over 10 runs in order to get statistically significant results.
The efficiency ηK of an allocation K is the obtained social welfare proportional to the maximum social welfare that can be achieved in the market and is given by: ηK = NT i=1 vi(K) NT i=1 vi(K∗) , (15) where K∗ = arg maxK∈K NT i=1 vi(K) is an efficient  allocation, K is the set of all possible allocations, vi(K) is bidder i"s utility for the allocation K ∈ K, and NT is the total  number of bidders participating across all auctions (including any global bidders).
Rather, since the global bidder increases the  number of bidders, its presence makes an overall positive (albeit small) contribution in case of static bidders.
Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the presence of a global bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case the local bidders are static.
Now, in order to measure the efficiency of the market and the impact of a global bidder, we run simulations for the markets with the different types of local bidders.

In a market with dynamic bidders, however, the market efficiency depends on two other factors.
This is because the differences between the bidders with the  highest valuations become smaller, thereby decreasing the loss of efficiency.
the sum of utilities of all agents in the market).
Specifically, efficiency in this context is maximised when the bidders with the M highest valuations in the entire market obtain a single item each.
The introduction of a global bidder potentially leads to a decrease of efficiency since this bidder can unwittingly win more than one item.
Thus, the allocation of items to bidders is inefficient.
In case of static local bidders, the number of bidders is known and the global bidder can bid more accurately.
N. For M = 6, on the other hand, the presence of a global bidder has a negative effect on the efficiency (this effect  becomes even more pronounced for higher values of M).
To conclude, the impact of a global bidder on the efficiency clearly depends on the information that is available.
If M is low (i.e., for M = 2), a global bidder  significantly increases the efficiency, especially for low values of 9 Trivial exceptions are when either M = 1 or N = 1 and  bidders are static, since the market is then completely efficient without a global bidder.
As can be observed from Figure 4,  however, the efficiency increases when N becomes larger.
In case of  uncertainty, however, the global bidder is more likely to win more than one item, decreasing the overall efficiency. 
To this end, in this section we study the efficiency of markets with either static or dynamic local bidders, and the impact that a global bidder has on the efficiency in these markets.
The Sixth Intl.
On the one hand, the efficiency increases since items no longer remain unsold (this situation can  occur in the dynamic model when no bidder turns up at an auction).
The local bidders bid their true valuations, whereas the global bidder bids optimally in each auction as described in  Section 4.3.
Efficiency is an important system-wide property since it  characterises to what extent the market maximises social welfare (i.e.
As M increases, the first effect becomes negligible whereas the second one becomes more prominent, reducing the efficiency on average.
Each bidder"s valuation is drawn from a uniform distribution with support [0, 1].
More formally, we define the efficiency of an allocation as: Definition 1 Efficiency of Allocation.
The error-bars indicate the standard deviation over the 10 runs.
This result is explained as follows.
The  experiments are carried out as follows.
The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.
