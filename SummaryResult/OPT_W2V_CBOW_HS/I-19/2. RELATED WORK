Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).
Their work analyses a market  consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.
This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.
This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).
Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.
On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed  auctions [1, 13, 5].
Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.
The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.
However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 
On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of  simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].
In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the  gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.
They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.
Such  analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g.
However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.
They  derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.
Thus, the couple"s bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.
The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].
Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be  segmented along two broad lines.
there are M  Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).
