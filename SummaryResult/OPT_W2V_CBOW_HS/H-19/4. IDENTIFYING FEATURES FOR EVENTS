This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).
(Dominant Power Spectrum) The  dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.
Clearly, the trajectory of your is very different from beenb, which means that the former has to be considered separately.
Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas.

Algorithm 1 Heuristic Stopwords detection (HS) Input: Seed SW set, weekday trajectories of all words 1: From the seed set SW, compute the maximum DPS as UDPS, maximum DFIDF as UDFIDF, and minimum of DFIDF as LDFIDF.
The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.
Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability.
• HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.

, T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear  combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, .
The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).
In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events.
Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.
From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power  spectrum, as follows.
4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T  complex numbers [X1, .
, T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.
Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high.
The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3.

Since it is hard to distinguish this feature set from HL and LL only based on DPS, we introduce another factor called average DFIDF (DFIDF).
, T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.
At first glance, we may be tempted to group both your and soccer into the same category of HL or LL since both distributions look similar and have the same dominant period of approximately a week.
For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).
The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .
(Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .
Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.
However, it is very dangerous to simply conclude that a power value of S = 9.42 corresponds to a stopword feature.
Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.

Features from this set has moderate DPS and low but known dominant period.
As shown in Figure 5, features like your usually have a lower DPS than a HL feature like soccer, but have a much higher DFIDF than another LL noisy feature such as beenb.
Before introducing our solution to this problem, let"s look at another LL example as shown in Figure 6 for beenb, which is actually a confirmed typo.
The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, .
Stop Words (SW) Feature Set Based on the above analysis, we realize that there must be another feature set between HL and LL that corresponds to the set of stopwords.
Thus, the DPS remains the only distinguishing factor  between your (Sf = 9.42) and soccer (Sf = 155.13).

analysis indicates that the periodicity of your is due to the differences in document counts for weekdays (average 2,919 per day) and weekends3 (average 479 per day).
3 The weekends here also include public holidays falling on weekdays.
One would have expected the periodicity of a stopword like your to be a day.
, XT ] via the discrete Fourier  transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, .
The basic idea is to only use news stories from weekdays to identify stopwords.
From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.
We therefore classify beenb as a noisy feature that does not contribute to any event.

Figure 7: The 5 feature sets for events. 
Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.
Since such properties are usually characteristics of stopwords, we group features like your into the newly defined stopword (SW) feature set.
Moreover, despite our DFIDF normalization, the weekday/weekend imbalance still prevailed; stopwords  occur 4 times more frequently on weekends than on weekdays.
Since setting the DPS and DFIDF thresholds for  identifying stopwords is more of an art than science, we proposed a heuristic HS algorithm, Algorithm 1.
An overview of all five feature sets is shown in Figure 7.
However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.
The SW set is initially seeded with a small set of 29 popular stopwords utilized by Google search engine.
