For example, Figure 8 shows the word feature Iraq with a burst circa 09/06/1996  being modeled as a Gaussian.
5.2 Detecting Periodic Features" Bursts Since we have computed the DP for a periodic feature f, we can easily model its periodic feature trajectory yf using 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 3/28/97 7/16/97 (a) original DFIDF:time 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 3/28/97 7/16/97 burst= [μ-σ, μ+σ] (b) identifying burst Figure 8: Modeling Iraq"s time series as a truncated Gaussian with μ = 09/06/1996 and σ = 6.26. a mixture of K = T/Pf Gaussians: f(yf = yf (t)|θf ) = K k=1 αk 1 2πσ2 k e − 1 2σ2 k (yf (t)−µk)2 , where the parameter set θf = {αk, μk, σk}K k=1 comprises: • αk is the probability of assigning yf into the kth  Gaussian.
5.1 Detecting Aperiodic Features" Bursts For each feature in HH and HL, we truncate its  trajectory by keeping only the bursty period, which is modeled with a Gaussian distribution.
In this section, we describe how bursts can be identified from the remaining features.
Each Gaussian represents one periodic event, and is modeled similarly as mentioned in Section 5.1. 
Unlike Kleinberg"s burst identification algorithm [12], we can identify both significant and trivial bursts without the need to set any parameters.
Its bursty period is defined by [μf − σf , μf + σf ] as shown in Figure 8(b).
The well known Expectation Maximization (EM) [8]  algorithm is used to compute the mixing proportions αk, as well as the individual Gaussian density parameters μk and σK .
Since only features from HH, HL and LH are  meaningful and could potentially be representative to some events, we pruned all other feature classified as LL or SW.
αk > 0, ∀k ∈ [1, K] and K k=1 αk = 1; • μk/σk is mean/standard deviation of the kth Gaussian.
