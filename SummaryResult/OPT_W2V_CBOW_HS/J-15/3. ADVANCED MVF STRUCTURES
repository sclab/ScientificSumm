229 The next theorem establishes that the functional constituents of MVF are the same as those for GAI decompositions as defined by Fishburn [13] for EU.
For this purpose we are now ready to employ the results of Bacchus and Grove [1], who establish that the CAI condition has a perfect map [20]; that is, there exists a graph whose nodes correspond to the set A, and its node separation reflects exactly the complete set of CAI conditions on A.
(2) An immediate result of Proposition 4 is that CDI is a symmetric relation.
, g (4) fr = u([Ir]) + r−1X k=1 (−1)k X 1≤i1<···<ik<r u([ k\ s=1 Iis ∩ Ir]) The proof directly shows that if graph G = (A, E) is a perfect map of CDI, u(A) decomposes to a sum over the functions defined in (4).1 Thus this proof does not rely on the decomposition result of Theorem 5, only on the existence of the perfect map.
Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI conditions on A.
For any I ⊆ A, the function u([I]) stands for the  projection of u(A) to I where the rest of the attributes are fixed at their reference levels.
Theorem 5 defines a decomposition structure, but to represent the actual MVF we need to specify the functions over the cliques.
To complete the analogy with CAI, we generalize Lemma 3 as follows.
Let X, Y, Z be a partition of the set of attributes A. X is conditionally difference independent of Y given Z,  denoted as CDI(X, Y | Z), if ∀ instantiations ˆZ, X1 , X2 , Y 1 , Y 2 [X1 Y 1 ˆZ, X2 Y 1 ˆZ] ∼ [X1 Y 2 ˆZ, X2 Y 2 ˆZ].
CDI(X, Y | Z) iff there exist functions ψ1(X, Z) and ψ2(Y, Z), such that u(X, Y, Z) = ψ1(X, Z) + ψ2(Y, Z).
Then the functional decomposition from that theorem can be defined as f1 = u([I1]), and for r = 2, .
, Ig are (overlapping) subsets of A, each  corresponding to a maximal clique of G. Given Theorem 5, we can now identify an MVF GAI structure from a collection of CDI conditions.
Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI condition on A, and {I1, .
, Ig} a set of maximal cliques as  defined in Theorem 5.
Their proofs can be easily adapted to CDI, since they only rely on the decomposition property of CAI that is also implied by CDI according to Proposition 4.
Then CDI(X, Y | Z) iff u(A) = u(X0 , Y, Z) + u(X, Y 0 , Z) − u(X0 , Y 0 , Z).
3.1 Conditional Difference Independence Our first step is to generalize Definition 6 to a conditional  version.
Since the conditional set is always the complement, we sometimes leave it implicit, using the abbreviated notation CDI(X, Y ).
We seek a finer-grain global decomposition of the utility function, similar to that obtained from mutual preferential  independence.
CDI leads to a decomposition similar to that obtained from CAI [17].
For example, if attributes a ∈ X and b /∈ X are complements or substitutes, X cannot be difference independent of ¯X.
Moreover, they show that the utility function decomposes over the set of maximal cliques of the perfect map.
3.2 GAI Structure for MVF A single CDI condition decomposes the value function into two parts.
Let u(A) be an MVF representing preference  differences.
This is in contrast with the fully additive decomposition of MVF that requires mutual  preferential independence [11].
However, X \ {a} may still be CDI of ¯X given a.
The CDI conditions, in turn, are particularly intuitive to detect when the preference differences carry a direct interpretation, as in the case with monetary  differences discussed below.
To summarize, the results of this section generalize additive MVF theory.
We adopt the following conventional  notation.
Moreover, the assumption or detection of CDI conditions can be performed incrementally, until the MVF is decomposed to a reasonable dimension.
, a0 m) be a predefined vector called the reference outcome.
In particular it justifies the application of methods recently developed under the EU framework [1, 4, 14, 6] to representation of value under certainty.
