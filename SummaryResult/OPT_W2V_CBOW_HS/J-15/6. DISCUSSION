It turns out that we can run this auction without any assumptions on sellers"  preference structure.
It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of  preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyer"s information revelation and the time required for convergence. 
Whereas these iterative  procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information  revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyer"s  utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.
In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the  mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyer"s profit).
In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.
In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.
The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we  compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].
It is therefore essential only that the buyer"s preference structure is accurately modeled.
If sellers whose preference structure does not agree with the one used by the auction are guided to submit only one full bid at each round, or a set of bids that does not yield undesired consistent combinations, all the properties of the auction 235 still hold.
We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of  willingnessto-pay.
Rather than assuming full additivity, or no  structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.
When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well.
Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auction"s structure.
In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction.
When this is not the case,  extracting reliable structure from sellers (in the form of CDI  conditions) is a serious challenge.
Our auction mechanism generalizes PK"s preference  modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation  properties.
Of course, capturing sellers" structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.
In some domains the structure can be more or less robust over time and over different decision makers.
6.1 Preferential Assumptions A key aspect in implementing GAI based auctions is the choice of the preference structure, that is, the elements {I1, .
It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.
The only place where this assumption is used in our analysis is for Lemma 8.
This could have been a deal breaker for such domains, but in fact it can be overcome.
6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in  multiattribute auctions.
