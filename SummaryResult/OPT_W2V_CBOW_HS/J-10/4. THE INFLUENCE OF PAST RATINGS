When a large proportion of the text of a review discusses a certain feature, the difference between the rating for that feature and the average rating up to that point tends to be large.
The first is that ratings truthfully reflect the quality observed by the users; the  second is that reviews are independent from one another.
In this case, the motivation for a negative report  following an overly high value of ef is different: user i seeks to correct the expectation of future visitors to the site.
The ratings that confirm the prior expectation will rarely be submitted.
There might exist a measure of influence exerted by past reports that pushes the user behind report i to submit  ratings which to some extent conforms with past reports: a low value for ef (i) can influence user i to submit a low rating for feature f because, for example, he fears that submitting a high rating will make him out to be a person with low standards5 .
The motivation for submitting  feedback is not only due to extreme opinions, but also to the difference between the current reputation (i.e., the prior  expectation of the user) and the actual experience.
Past reviews create some prior  expectation regarding the quality of service, and this expectation has an influence on the submitted review.
To test Hypothesis 3 we measure the average absolute difference between the expectation ef (i) and the rating ri f when the weight wi f is high, respectively low.

Weights are classified high or low by comparing them with certain cutoff values: wi f is low if smaller than 0.1, while wi f is high if greater than θf .
4.1 Prior Expectations We define the prior expectation of user i regarding the feature f, as the average of the previously available ratings on the feature f4 : ef (i) = j<i,r j f =0 rj f j<i,r j f =0 1 As a first hypothesis, we assert that the rating ri f is a function of the prior expectation ef (i): Hypothesis 2.
City O R S C V 3.953 4.045 3.985 4.252 3.946 Boston 3.364 3.590 3.485 3.641 3.242 [0.011] [0.028] [0.0086] [0.0168] [0.0034] 4.284 4.358 4.064 4.530 4.428 Sydney 3.756 3.537 3.436 3.918 3.495 [0.000] [0.000] [0.035] [0.009] [0.000] 3.494 3.674 3.713 3.689 3.580 Las Vegas 3.140 3.530 2.952 3.530 3.351 [0.190] [0.529] [0.007] [0.529] [0.253] are defined as follows: Rhigh f = {ri f |ef (i) > θ} Rlow f = {ri f |ef (i) < θ} These sets are specific for each (hotel, feature) pair, and in our experiments we took θ = 4.
The set of reviews preceded by high, respectively low expectations 3 part of Amazon reviews were recognized as strategic posts by book authors or competitors 4 if no previous ratings were assigned for feature f, ef (i) is assigned a default value of 4.
Intuitively, these are the hotels for which there is a minimal degree of variation in the timely sequence of reviews: i.e., the cumulative average of ratings was at some point high and afterwards became low, or vice-versa.
As we might expect, for a feature that rarely was a high weight in the discussion, (e.g., cleanliness) the difference is particularly large.
The intuition behind this claim is that when the user is adamant about voicing his opinion regarding a certain  feature, his opinion differs from the collective opinion of  previous postings.
Consider, for example, the following review: I don"t understand the negative reviews... the hotel was a little dark, but that was the style.
We test on our data set the proportion of ratings that  attempt to correct the current estimate.
For each city, we take all hotels and compute the average ratings in the sets Rhigh f and Rlow f (see Table 3).
For a given hotel and feature, given the reviews i and j such that ef (i) is high and ef (j) is low, the rating rj f exceeds the rating ri f .
In this case, an overly high value for ef (i) would drive the user to  submit a negative report (or vice versa), stemming from the difference between the actual value of the service, and the inflated expectation of this value acquired  before his experience.
This rather high value is close to the average rating across all features across all hotels, and is justified by the fact that our data set contains mostly high quality hotels.
This reinforces the idea that users are more likely to submit a report when they believe they have something distinctive to add to the current stream of opinions for some feature.
Such a rating model produces ratings that most of the time deviate from the current average rating.
Such conclusions are in total agreement with prior evidence that the distribution of reports often follows bi-modal, U-shaped distributions.
A perusal of online reviews shows that reviews are often part of discussion threads, where users make an effort to contradict, or vehemently agree with the remarks of previous users.
For each of the three considered cities, the following tables, show the proportion of deviant ratings for θ = 0.5 and θ = 1.
As further evidence, we consider all hotels for which the function eV (i) (the expectation for the feature Value) has a high value (greater than 4) for some i, and a low value (less than 4) for some other i.
The average rating amongst reviews following low prior expectations is significantly higher than the average rating following high expectations.
This is because only few reviews discussed value heavily.
Unlike the interpretation above, this does not require the user to derive an a priori expectation for the value of f. Note that neither interpretation implies that the average up to report i is inversely related to the rating at report i.
This relies on the characteristic of reputation systems as feedback forums where a user is interested in  projecting his opinion, with particular strength if this opinion differs from what he perceives to be the general opinion.
It seems that TripAdvisor users regularly read the reports submitted by previous users before booking a hotel, or  before writing a review.
We define high and low expectations as those that are above, respectively below a certain cutoff value θ.
We define a deviant rating as one that deviates from the current expectation by at least some threshold θ, i.e., |ri f − ef (i)| ≥ θ.
The reason could be cultural or because there was less of a reason to discuss this feature.
However, this conformity rating cannot continue  indefinitely: once the set of reports project a sufficiently deflated estimate for vf , future reviewers with comparatively positive impressions will seek to correct this misconception.
Not surprisingly, his ratings were considerably higher than the average ratings up to this point.
4.3 Reporting Incentives Previous models suggest that users who are not highly opinionated will not choose to voice their opinions [12].
4.2 Impact of textual comments on quality expectation Further insight into the rating behavior of TripAdvisor users can be obtained by analyzing the relationship between the weights wf and the values ef (i).
Such variations are observed for about half of all hotels in each city.
The correlation between the reviews has also been  confirmed by recent research on the dynamics of online review forums [6].
Cleanliness has a lower cutoff since it is a feature rarely discussed; Value has a high cutoff for the opposite reason.
5 The idea that negative reports can encourage further  negative reporting has been suggested before [14] Table 4: Average of |ri f −ef (i)| when weights are high (first value in the cell) and low (second value in the cell) with P-values for the difference in sq.
• The expected value of feature f for all subsequent  visitors of the site, if user i were not to submit a report.
The waitresses are great (and *** does not deserve the bad review she got, she was 100% attentive to us!
138 There are two ways to interpret the function ef (i): • The expected value for feature f obtained by user i  before his experience with the service, acquired by  reading reports submitted by past users.
Even though the difference in the feature Value is quite large for Sydney, the P-value is high.
Here, the user was disturbed by previous negative reports, addressed these concerns, and set about trying to correct them.
The subjective perception of quality is directly proportional to how well the actual experience meets the prior expectation, a fact confirmed by an important line of econometric and  marketing research [17, 18, 16, 21].

Two important assumptions are generally made about  reviews submitted to online forums.
This, at first, appears to contradict Hypothesis 2.
Figure 3 plots the median (across considered hotels) rating, rV , when ef (i) is not more than x but greater than x − 0.5.

Yes it was close to the freeway, but in my opinion the sound of an occasional loud car is better than hearing the ding ding of slot machines all night!
In particular, we  examine the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 3.
We believe this observation holds for most online forums.
Different cutoff values were used for  different features: θR = 0.4, θS = 0.4, θC = 0.2, and θV = 0.7.
In this section, we extend this model to account for the  influence of expectations.
