Although agent interaction plays a vital role in MAS, and  messagecentric approaches to agent interaction have their drawbacks, present agent-oriented programming languages do not provide support for implementing agent interaction that is flexible and robust.
The contributions of this paper are: a mapping from a commitment machine to a collection of BDI-style plans; extensions to the semantics of BDI programming languages; and an examination of two issues that arise when distributing  commitment machines (turn management and race conditions) and  solutions to these problems.
In this  paper we consider one approach for modelling agent interactions: the commitment machines framework.
This framework supports  modelling interactions at a higher level (using social commitments),  resulting in more flexible interactions.
We investigate how  commitmentbased interactions can be implemented in conventional agent-oriented programming languages.
