Third, as we saw in Section 9, the clearing problem is much easier in 5 Formally, this means that if the bidder is forced to pay the full amount that his bid allows for a particular vector of payments to charities, the bidder is indifferent between this and not participating in the mechanism at all.
Theorem 7 indicates that there is no reason to decide on donations to multiple charities under a single mechanism (rather than a separate one for each charity), when an  efficient mechanism with the desired properties exists for the single-charity case.
First of all, even when there is only one charity, it may make sense to underbid one"s true valuation for the charity.
Up to this point, we have not discussed the bidders"  incentives for bidding any particular way.
Moreover, in the quasilinear setting (unlike in the general setting), it makes sense to pursue social welfare (the sum of the utilities) as the objective, because now 1) units of utility correspond directly to units of money, so that we do not have the problem of the bidders arbitrarily scaling their utilities; and 2) it is no longer possible to give a payment willingness function of 0 while still affecting the donations through a utility function.
There is no mechanism which is ex-post  budget balanced, ex-post efficient, and ex-interim individually rational with Bayes-Nash equilibrium as the solution concept (even with only one charity, only two quasilinear bidders, with identical type distributions (uniform over two types, with either both utility functions being step functions or both utility functions being concave piecewise linear functions)).
Then there exists such a mechanism for any number of charities.
There exist settings with two charities where there exists no ex-post budget balanced, ex-post  efficient, and ex-interim individually rational mechanism with Bayes-Nash equilibrium as the solution concept for either charity alone; but there exists an ex-post budget balanced, ex-post efficient, and ex-post individually rational  mechanism with dominant strategies as the solution concept for both charities together.
Furthermore, suppose that there exists a single-charity mechanism M that, for a certain subclass P of (quasilinear) preferences, under a given solution concept S  (implementation in dominant strategies or Bayes-Nash equilibrium) and a given notion of individual rationality R (ex post, ex  interim, or none), satisfies a certain notion of budget balance (ex post, ex ante, or none), and is ex-post efficient.
But now, if bidder 3 reports u1 3(πc1 ) = 0  everywhere; u2 3(πc2 ) = 3 if πc2 ≥ 1, u2 3(πc2 ) = 0 otherwise (this part of the bid is truthful); and w3(u3) = 1 3 u3 if u3 ≤ 1, w3(u3) = 1 3 otherwise; then charity 2 will receive at least 1, and bidder 3 will have to pay at most 1 3 .
Two mechanisms that satisfy efficiency (and can in fact be applied directly to the multiple-charity problem without use of the previous theorem) are the VCG (which is incentive compatible in dominant strategies) and dAGVA (which is incentive compatible only in Bayes-Nash equilibrium)  mechanisms.
The second bidder bids u1 2(πc1 ) = 1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1 1(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; u2 2(πc2 ) = 0 (always); w2(u2) = 1 4 u2 if u2 ≤ 1, w2(u2) = 1 4 + 1 100 (u2 −1) otherwise.
However, because under the  requirements of Theorem 8, no such mechanism exists, there may be a benefit to bringing the charities under the same  umbrella.
We observe that in this case, the strategic bidder is not only affecting how much the bidders pay, but also how much the charities receive.
Such mechanisms (for example, first-price auctions, where winners pay the value of their bids) are typically not strategy-proof: if a bidder reports her true valuation for an outcome, then if this outcome occurs, the payment the  bidder will have to make will offset her gains from the outcome completely.
This means the mechanism is not strategy-proof.
This is not too surprising, because the mechanism described so far is, in a sense, a first-price mechanism, where the  mechanism will extract as much payment from a bidder as her bid allows.
A mechanism is budget balanced if there is no flow of money into or out of the system-in general (ex-post), or in expectation over the type reports (ex-ante).
Of course, we could try to change the rules of the game-which outcome (payment vector to charities) do we select for which bid vector, and which bidder pays how much-in order to make bidding truthfully beneficial, and to make the outcome better with regard to the bidders" true preferences.
The same is true if bidder 3 does not place a bid at all (as in the previous type of manipulation); hence bidder 2"s utility will be 1 in this case.
The dAGVA mechanism does not satisfy ex-post individual  rationality.
Specifically, the bids may not truthfully reflect the bidders" preferences over  charities because a bidder may bid strategically, misrepresenting her preferences in order to obtain a result that is better to herself.
The case of step-functions in this theorem corresponds  exactly to the case of a single, fixed-size, nonexcludable public good (the public good being that the charity receives the desired amount)-for which such an impossibility result is already known [14].
Then the bidder is best off not bidding at all (or submitting a utility for the charity of 0), to avoid having to make any payment.
Fourth, as we will show shortly, the quasilinearity assumption in some cases allows for decomposing the mechanism design problem over the charities (as it did for the simple clearing problem).
Suppose that there are two charities, and three bidders.
10.1 Strategic bids under the first-price mechanism We first point out some reasons for bidders to misreport their preferences under the first-price mechanism described in the paper up to this point.
A mechanism is efficient if it (always) produces the efficient allocation of wealth to charities.
Now, it is straightforward to check that, if the third bidder bids truthfully, regardless of whether the objective is surplus maximization or total donated, charity 1 will receive at least 1, and charity 2 will receive less than 1.
(Compare this to bidding truthfully in a first-price auction.)
Second, because of this success, some very general mechanisms have been discovered for the  quasilinear setting (for instance, the VCG mechanisms [24, 4, 10], or the dAGVA mechanism [6, 1]) which we could apply  directly to the expressive charity donation problem.
Each of them, however, has a drawback that would probably make it impractical in the setting of donations to charities.
With multiple charities, another kind of manipulation may occur, where the bidder attempts to steer others" payments towards her preferred charity.
Now, the third bidder"s true preferences are accurately  represented5 by the bid u1 3(πc1 ) = 1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1 3(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; u2 3(πc2 ) = 3 if πc2 ≥ 1, u2 3(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; and w3(u3) = 1 3 u3 if u3 ≤ 1, w3(u3) = 1 3 + 1 100 (u3 − 1)  otherwise.
The first bidder bids u1 1(πc1 ) = 1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1 1(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; u2 1(πc2 ) = 1 if πc2 ≥ 1, u2 1(πc2 ) = 0 otherwise; and w1(u1) = u1 if u1 ≤ 1, w1(u1) = 1+ 1 100 (u1 −1) otherwise.
The VCG mechanism is not budget balanced.
Incentive compatibility (IC) means that bidders are best off reporting their preferences truthfully; either  regardless of the others" types (in dominant strategies), or in expectation over them (in Bayes-Nash equilibrium).
Additionally, suppose that the other bids guarantee that the charity will receive at least x no matter what bid the bidder submits (and the bidder knows this).
In the next subsection, we will investigate if we can do better in the setting of donations to charities.
The next proposition shows that this is indeed the case.
10.2 Mechanism design in the quasilinear setting There are four reasons why the mechanism design  approach is likely to be most successful in the setting of  quasilinear preferences.
For example, suppose a bidder would like a charity to receive a certain amount x, but does not care if the charity receives more than that.
A type is a preference profile that a bidder can have and can report (thus, a type report is a bid).
(Even when the conditions are the same as in Theorem 8, apart from the fact that there are now two charities.)
Suppose all agents" preferences are  quasilinear.
Many similar results are known,  probably the most famous of which is the Myerson-Satterthwaite impossibility result, which proves the impossibility of  efficient bilateral trade under the same requirements [15].
First, historically, mechanism design has been been most successful when the quasilinear assumption could be made.
Individual rationality (IR) means agents are at least as well off participating in the mechanism as not participating; either regardless of the others" types (ex-post), or in expectation over them (ex-interim).
Because up to this amount of payment, one unit of money corresponds to three units of utility to bidder 3, it follows his utility is now at least 3 − 1 = 2 > 1.
10.3 Impossibility of efficiency In this subsection, we show that even in a very restricted setting, and with minimal requirements on IC and IR  constraints, it is impossible to create a mechanism that is  efficient.
58 this setting, and thus we are less likely to run into  computational trouble for the mechanism design problem.
In this section, we will briefly discuss the options that mechanism design provides for the expressive charity donation problem.
This is the field of mechanism design.
(We will show some concrete examples of this shortly.)
(This is known in economics as the free rider problem [14].
Before presenting the decomposition result, we introduce some terms from game theory.
