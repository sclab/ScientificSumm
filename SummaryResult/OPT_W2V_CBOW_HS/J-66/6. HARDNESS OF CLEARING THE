(The solution is nonzero by assumption; if only some bk are accepted, the total payment from these bids is at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| < 1, which is not enough for any bid to be accepted; and if one of the bl is accepted, then the threshold for the corresponding bv is also reached.)
It follows that we can  interpret the outcome in the DONATION-CLEARING instance as a partial assignment of truth values to variables: v is set to true if b+v is accepted, and to false if b−v is accepted.
All that is left to show is that this partial assignment satisfies at least T clauses.
Every ui j is a line; that is, the utility that each bidder derives from any charity is linear; 2.
First we show that if a clause bid bk is accepted, then either bl1 k or bl2 k is accepted (and thus either l1 k or l2 k is set to true, hence k is satisfied).
MARKET In this section, we will show that the clearing problem is completely inapproximable, even when every bidder"s utility function is linear (with slope 0 or 1 in each charity"s  payments), each bidder cares either about at most two charities or about all charities equally, and each bidder"s payment willingness function is a step function.
So there exists a solution with positive surplus to the DONATION-CLEARING instance.
Unless P=NP, there is no polynomial-time algorithm for approximating DONATION-CLEARING (with either the surplus or the total amount donated as the  objective) within any ratio f(n), where f is a nonzero function of the size of the instance.
If in this solution, l is true, then let πcl = 2 + T 8|V |2|K| ; otherwise πcl = 0.
We will reduce from MAX2SAT (given a formula in conjunctive normal form (where each clause has two literals) and a target number of satisfied clauses T, does there exist an assignment of truth values to the variables that makes at least T clauses true?
First, as we will show, there are very expressive families of bids for which the problem is solvable in  polynomial time.
In the following, we will represent bids as follows: ({(ck, ak)}, s, t) indicates that uk j (πck ) = akπck (this  function is 0 for ck not mentioned in the bid), and wj(uj) = t for uj ≥ s, wj(uj) = 0 otherwise.
For every clause k = {l1 k, l2 k} ∈ K, there is a bid bk = ({(cl1 k , 1), (cl2 k , 1)}, 2, 1 8|V ||K| ).
All that remains to show is that at least T clause bids are accepted.
Because is not possible (for any v ∈ V ) that both b+v and b−v are accepted, it follows that the total payment by the bv and the bl can be at most 2|V | − 1 4 .
If cl1 k does not receive at least 2, bl1 k is not accepted, and it is easy to check that the bids bv1 k , b+v1 k , b−v1 k contribute (at least) 1 less than is paid to c+v1 k and c+v1 k .
If the MAX2SAT instance has no solution, then the only valid outcome is the zero outcome (no bidder pays  anything and no charity receives anything); 2.
We now show that b0 is accepted.
For this v, bv1 k , b+v1 k , b−v1 k contribute (at least) 1 4|V | less than the total payments to c+v and c−v.
To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary MAX2SAT instance, given by a set of clauses K = {k} = {(l1 k, l2 k)} over a variable set V together with a target number of  satisfied clauses T, to the following DONATION-CLEARING instance.
(Solving the problem to optimality is NP-complete in many other (noncomparable or even more restricted) settings as well-we omit such results because of space constraint.)
It is easily seen that for any other v , accepting any subset of {bv , b+v , b−v } would  require that at least as much is given to c+v and c−v as can be extracted from these bids, so this cannot help.
For each bk, either both of l1 k, l2 k are false and the bid is not accepted, or at least one of them (say li k) is true (that is, k is satisfied) and cli k receives at least 2, and the threshold has been met.
Suppose it is not; then one of the bv must be accepted.
It follows that b0 is accepted.
Every bidder either has at most 2 charities that affect her utility (with slope 1), or all charities affect her utility (with slope 1); 4.
For every literal l, there is a bid bl = ({(cl, 1)}, 2, 1).
Again, the other bv and bl cannot (by themselves) help to close this gap; and the bk can contribute at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| < 1 4|V | .
Also, the only bids that are not accepted (meaning the threshold is not met) are the bl where l is false, and the bk such that both of l1 k, l2 k are false.
Now suppose there exists a nonzero outcome in the DONATION-CLEARING instance.
Every bid is a threshold bid; that is, every bidder"s payment willingness function wj is a step function.
For every literal l ∈ L, there is a charity cl.
For instance, even though the problem of clearing combinatorial auctions is NP-complete [20] (even to approximate [21]), they are typically solved to optimality in practice. 
First we show that it is not possible (for any v ∈ V ) that both b+v and b−v are accepted.
If bk is accepted, at least one of cl1 k and cl2 k must be receiving at least 1; without loss of generality, say it is cl1 k , and say l1 k corresponds to variable v1 k (that is, it is +v1 k or −v1 k).
Then, let the set of bids be as follows.
Adding b0"s payment of 1 4 + 1 16|V ||K| to this, we still need T − 1 2 8|V ||K| from the bk.
The bids bv, b+v, b−v cannot contribute more than 3, so we need another 1 at least.
So we can decide whether arbitrary MAX2SAT  instances are satisfiable this way, and it would follow that P=NP.
It would return a nonzero solution when the MAX2SAT instance has a solution, and a zero solution  otherwise.
For every variable v, there is a bid bv = ({(c+v, 1), (c−v, 1)}, 2, 1 − 1 4|V | ).
Let the set of charities be as follows.
The total amount that can be extracted from the accepted bids is at least |V |(1− 1 4|V | )+|V |+T 1 8|V ||K| + 1 4 + 1 16|V ||K| ) = 2|V |+ T 8|V ||K| + 1 16|V ||K| > 2|V |+ T 8|V ||K| , so there is positive surplus.
Otherwise, there exists a solution with positive surplus.
First we show that no bidder whose bid is accepted pays more than she is willing to.
Finally, all the other bids combined can contribute at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| + 1 4 + 1 16|V ||K| < 1.
The problem is in NP because we can  nondeterministically choose the payments to be made and received, and check the validity and objective value of this outcome.
Additionally, the DONATION-CLEARING instances that we reduce to have the following properties: 1.
54 For each bl, either l is false and the bid is not accepted, or l is true, cl receives at least 2, and the threshold has been met.
First, suppose there exists a solution to the MAX2SAT instance.
But each one of them contributes at most 1 8|V ||K| , so at least T of them must be accepted.
All the ui j have slope either 0 or 1; 3.
Suppose we had such a polynomial time  algorithm, and applied it to the DONATION-CLEARING  instances that were reduced from MAX2SAT instances in  Theorem 1.
Now, in order for b0 to be accepted, a total of 2|V |+ T 8|V ||K| must be donated.
This holds even if the  DONATIONCLEARING structures satisfy all the properties given in Theorem 1.
For each bv, either c+v or c−v receives at least 2, so this bidder"s threshold has been met.
There exists a reduction from MAX2SAT instances to DONATION-CLEARING instances such that 1.
Finally, there is a single bid that values all charities equally: b0 = ({(c1, 1), (c2, 1), .
Finally, because the total amount received by the charities is 2|V | + T 8|V ||K| , b0"s threshold has also been met.
For, this would require that πc+v + πc−v ≥ 4.
But this is the same situation that we analyzed before, and we know it is impossible.
We show the two instances are equivalent.
This should not be interpreted to mean that our approach is infeasible.
), which is NP-complete [7].
Second, NP-completeness is often overcome in practice (especially when the stakes are high).
