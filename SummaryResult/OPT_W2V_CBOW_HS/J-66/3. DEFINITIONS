In our bidding framework, a bid will specify, for each vector of total payments made to the charities, how much that bidder is willing to contribute.
We choose the valid outcome that maximizes the objective that we have for the donation process.
We are asked to find an objective-maximizing valid outcome.
A valid  outcome is an outcome where 1. n j=1 πbj ≥ m i=1 πci (at least as much money is collected as is given away); 2.
We are given a set of n bids over charities c1, c2, .
, cm, a bid by bidder bj is a function vj : Rm → R. The  interpretation is that if charity ci receives a total amount of πci , then bidder j is willing to donate (up to) vj(πc1 , πc2 , .
(The contribution of this bidder is also counted in the vector of  paymentsso, the vector of total payments to the charities represents the amount given by all donating parties, not just the ones other than this bidder.)
We now define possible outcomes in our model, and which outcomes are valid given the bids that were made.
We will refer to it as the clearing problem.
The following definition makes the general form of a bid in our framework precise.
The formal definition follows.
, πbn ), and a vector of payments received by the charities (πc1 , πc2 , .
Throughout this paper, we will refer to the offers that the donating parties make as bids, and to the donating parties as bidders.
Another objective is total amount  donated, given by m i=1 πci .
(Here, different weights could also be placed on the different charities.)
This is the topic of the next section.
In a setting with m charities c1, c2, .
One example of an objective is surplus, given by n j=1 πbj − m i=1 πci .
The surplus could be the profits of a company managing the expressive donation marketplace; but,  alternatively, the surplus could be returned to the bidders, or given to the charities.
Additionally, we are given an objective function.
An outcome is a vector of payments made by the bidders (πb1 , πb2 , .
2 In general, the objective function may also depend on the bids, but the objective functions under consideration in this paper do not depend on the bids.
How difficult the DONATION-CLEARING problem is  depends on the types of bids used and the language in which they are expressed.
Finding the valid outcome that maximizes the objective is a (nontrivial) computational problem.
An objective is a function from the set of all outcomes to R.2 After all bids have been collected, a valid outcome will be chosen that maximizes this objective.
Definition 2.
The bidding language is expressive enough that no bidder should have to make more than one bid.
The techniques presented in this paper will typically generalize to objectives that take the bids into account directly. 
, πcm ) (no bidder gives more than she is willing to).
For all 1 ≤ j ≤ n, πbj ≤ vj(πc1 , πc2 , .
Of course, in the end, only one of the valid outcomes can be chosen.
