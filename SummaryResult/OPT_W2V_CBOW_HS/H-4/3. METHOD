Time information was used to examine the frequency with which the participants re-found old and new information, and when combined with difficulty ratings created a  picture of whether or not the time period between accessing and re-accessing impacted on how difficult the participants perceived tasks to be.
The experimenter ensured that the participants  understood that the tasks to be recorded were not limited to the types shown in the examples.
The final population  consisted of 4 academic staff members, 8 research staff  members, 6 research students and 18 undergraduate students.
The participants were provided with a personalised web form in which they could record details about their information needs and the contexts in which these needs developed.
Again, they were able to choose from 5 options (less than a day ago, less than a week ago, less than a month ago, less than a year ago, more than a year ago).
The diary form solicited the following information: whether the information need related to re-finding a web page or an email message and a description of the task they are  performing.
This description was to contain both the  information that the participant wished to find and the reason that they needed the information.
Web forms were deployed rather than  paperbased diaries because to re-find web and email information the user would be at a computer with an Internet  connection and there would be no need to search for a paper-based diary and pen.
To help with this, the form gave three example task descriptions, which were also  explained verbally to each participant during an introductory session.
The examples were  supplied purely to get participants thinking about the kinds of things they could record and to show the level of and type of details expected.
36 participants, recruited by mass advertisement through departmental communication channels, research group  meetings and undergraduate lectures, were asked to digitally record details of their information re-finding tasks over a period of approximately 3 weeks.
Limitations of the technique include difficulties in maintaining participant dedication levels and convincing participants that seemingly mundane information is useful and should be reported [19].
By asking users to record fewer tasks it was anticipated that  participant apathy would be reduced and dedication levels  maintained.
Diary Studies are a naturalistic technique, offering the ability to capture factual data, in a natural setting,  without the distracting influence of an observer.
As both  personal and work tasks were recorded, the results collected cover a broad range of re-finding tasks. 
The form also asked participants to rate each task in terms of difficulty (on a scale from 1-5, where 1 was very easy and 5 was very hard).
To this end, we restricted the recorded tasks to web and email re-finding.
In our diary study, we followed the suggestions in [12] to achieve the best possible data.
Finally, they were asked when was the last time they looked at the sought  after information.
[12] suggest that the effects of the negatives can be  limited, however, with careful design and good  implementation.
The ages of participants ranged from 19-59.
