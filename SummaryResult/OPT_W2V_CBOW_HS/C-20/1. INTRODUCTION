When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization  framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.
In the LAN environment, these  technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.
Second, while fairly sophisticated remote  replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.
Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.
Our main contribution is the design of a framework that will allow the migration across a WAN of all subsystems involved with enabling data center services.
Not only can it support planned maintenance events [8], but it can also be used in a more dynamic fashion to automatically balance load between the  physical servers in a data center [22].
The essence of our approach is  cooperative, context aware migration, where a migration management  system orchestrates the data center migration across all three  subsystems involved, namely the server platforms, the wide area network and the disk storage system.
Our design makes use of existing server virtualization  technologies and propose network and storage mechanisms to facilitate migration across a WAN.
In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level  interactions are not disrupted.
Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.
A significant concern for Internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of  outages, whether planned or unplanned.
Similarly, in a LAN environment, storage requirements are normally met via either network attached storage (NAS) or via a storage area network (SAN) which is still  reachable from the new physical server location to allow for continued storage access.
We describe new mechanisms as well as extensions to existing  technologies to enable this and outline the cooperative, context aware functionality needed across the different subsystems to enable this.
These concerns are  exacerbated by the increased use of the Internet for mission critical  business and real-time entertainment applications.
While conceptually similar in nature to the LAN based work described above, using migration  technologies across a wide area network presents unique challenges and has to our knowledge not been achieved.
While this is fairly easily achieved in a shared LAN environment, no current  mechanisms are available to efficiently achieve the same feat in a WAN environment.
In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.
Today these services are almost exclusively hosted in data centers.
A relatively minor outage can disrupt and inconvenience a large number of users.
