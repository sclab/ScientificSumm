We propose a cluster-based method for  selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback.
With term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without  interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query expansion process.
Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback.

In this paper we study term-based feedback for information  retrieval in the language modeling approach.
They are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top.
