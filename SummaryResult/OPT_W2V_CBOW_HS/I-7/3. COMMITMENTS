For any order of the players an extortion contains, for each player, an optimal commitment given the  commitments of the players that committed earlier.
Situations like this, in which players can make unconditional commitments in a fixed order, can fruitfully be analyzed as extensive form games, and the most lucrative  unconditional commitment can be found through backward induction.
These  assumptions imply that the outcome of the game is entirely determined by the commitments the players make.
E.g., in the two-player game of Figure 2 and given the  order (Row, Col), Row has two conditional commitments, top and bottom, which we will henceforth denote t and b. Col, on the other hand, has four conditional commitments, corresponding to the  different functions mapping strategies of Row to those of Col.
The  strategies for the column player in the extensive game are given by the four functions that map strategies of the row player in the  strategic game to one of his own.
If now, Col simultaneously were able to commit to the conditional strategy to play right if Row plays top, and left, otherwise, there is no strategy profile that can be played without one of the players" bluff being called.
In a 2 × 2 game, it could occur that Row commits conditionally on playing top if the The Sixth Intl.
From the perspective of conditional commitments, however,  players move in reverse order.
More formally, the strategy profile f = (fπ1 , .
Important types of commitments, however, cannot simply be  analyzed as unconditional commitments to actions.
Transforming this extensive form back into a strategic game (see Figure 4), we find that there exists a second equilibrium besides the one found by means of backward induction.
, n} is a finite set of players, Ai is a set of actions available to player i and ui a real-valued utility function for player i on the set of (pure) strategy profiles S = A1×· · ·×An.
(This is also the reason why the credibility of a threat is not  necessarily undermined if its putting into effect means that the threatener is also harmed.)
, fπn ) for a conditional commitment profile f is defined inductively as fπ1 =df.
We further have σ(a) and σi(a) denote the probability of action a in mixed strategy profile σ or mixed strategy σi, respectively.
, Xπn are (abstract) sets of commitments and φ is a function mapping each profile in X = Xπ1 × · · · × Xπn to a (mixed) strategy profile of G. A commitment type Xπ1 , .

If we consider a conditional commitment f for Col such that f (t) = l and f (b) = r, then (t, f ) is a conditional commitment profile and (t, f ) = (t, f (t)) = (t, l).

, Fπn , is the tuple associated with the same game by the type of (pure)  conditional commitments. 
To illustrate this point, consider once more the game in Figure 2 and observe that neither player can improve on the outcome  obtained via iterated strong dominance by committing  unconditionally to some strategy.
, πn) of the players can be interpreted as an  extensive form game with perfect information (see, e.g., [4, 6])1 , in which π1 chooses his action first, π2 second, and so on.
Along a similar line of reasoning, however, Col would wish to commit to the left column, as convincing Row of this commitment guarantees him the most desirable outcome.
We, by contrast, try to steer clear from fixed point  constructions by assuming that the players make their commitment in a particular order.
(This will suffice to deter Row, and there is no need for an additional promise on the part of Col.) He cannot do so by merely committing unconditionally, and neither can Row if he were to commit first.
By committing, an agent can improve his strategic position.
The strategies available to the row player are the same as in the strategic form: choosing the top or the bottom row.
This line of reasoning can be generalized to yield an  algorithm for finding optimal conditional commitments for general  twoplayer games: 1.
, πn) of the players, we define the set Fπi of (pure) conditional commitments of a player πi as the set of functions from Aπ1 × · · · × Aπi−1 to Aπi .
The essence of a threat, for example, is deterrence.
By a conditional commitment  profile f we understand any combination of conditional commitments in Fπ1 × · · · × Fπn .
We will find that it is not always beneficial to commit earlier than later or vice versa.
Intuitively, π reflects the sequential order in which the players can make their commitments, with πn committing first, πn−1 second, and so on.
If, however, the strategies of Col in the extensive form are thought of as his conditional commitments he can make in case 1 For a formal definition of a game in extensive form, the reader consult one of the standard textbooks, such as [4] or [6].
For each tπ1 ∈ Aπ1 with tπ1 sπ1 , find a strategy tπ2 ∈ Aπ2 that minimizes uπ1 (tπ1 , tπ2 ), and set fπ2 (tπ1 ) = tπ2 .
We write Σi for the set of mixed strategies available to player i, and Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn for the set of mixed strategy profiles.
If made sequentially, both of them determine a unique strategy profile in a given strategic game.
If Col can make a  conditional commitment of playing the right column if Row chooses top, and the left column otherwise, this leaves Row with the easy choice between a payoff of zero or one, and Col may expect a payoff of three.
It is not in general the case that any two commitments can both be credible.
We also assume commitments to be complete, in the sense that they fully lay down a player"s behavior in all foreseeable circumstances.
Otherwise, find the strategy profile (sπ1 , sπ2 ) with the highest payoff to π2 among the ones that have not yet been  considered.
This is in essence the line of thought Selten followed in his famous argument for subgame perfect  equilibria [10].
Consider for  example the 2×2 game in Figure 1, in which one player, Row, chooses rows and another, Col, chooses columns.
Each player can then make his commitments  dependent on the actions of the players to commit after him, but not on the commitments of the players that committed before.
For π1 we have the set of conditional commitments coincide with Aπ1 .
This equilibrium with outcome (1, 3), indicated by the thick lines in Figure 3, has been argued to be unacceptable in the sequential game as it would involve an incredible threat by Col: once Row has played top, Col finds himself confronted with a fait accompli.
It may even be advantageous to commit to a strategy that is strongly dominated, i.e., one for which there is another strategy that yields a better payoff no matter how the other agents act.
Another point to heed is that we only consider the case in which the commitments are considered absolutely binding.
Since checking the semantic equivalence of two commitments (or commitment conditions) is undecidable in general, Tennenholtz bases his definition of program equilibrium on syntactic  equivalence.
However, if Row succeeds in convincing Col of his commitment to play bottom, the latter had better choose the right column.
, fπn ) will be called the path of f .
In this manner, each  conditional commitment profile f can be seen to determine a unique strategy profile, denoted by f , which will be played if all players stick to their conditional commitments.
Applying backward induction to the extensive form game yields subgame perfect  equilibria, which arguably provide appropriate solutions in this setting.
Figure 2 shows an example, in which Col can guarantee himself a payoff of three by threatening to choose the right column if Row chooses top.
Although these might be  implausible assumptions for some situations, we had better study the idealized case first, before tackling the complications of the more general case.
Thus we also  assume that it is possible for Col to make credible the threat to choose the right column if Row were to play top, so as to ensure the latter is always better off to play the bottom row.
There is a natural way in which a strategic game G together with an ordering (π1, .
If, on the other hand, both players actually commit themselves in this way but without convincing the other party of their having done so, the game ends in misery for both.
3.3 Commitment Types So far, we have distinguished between conditional and  unconditional commitments.
Observe that under this assumption the strategies in the extensive form game and the conditional commitments in the strategic game G with  ordering π are mathematically the same objects.
For a player i and (mixed) strategy profiles σ and τ we write σ i τ if ui (σ) ui (τ).
Generalizing the idea underlying this algorithm, we present in Section 4 the concept of an extortion, which applies to games with any number of players.
Thus, Row attains a payoff of two instead of one.
This notion of sequential commitment allows for generalization and gives rise to the following definition of a (sequential) commitment type.
Each player can condition his action on the actions of all players that are to commit after him.
We will argue that under this  interpretation other strategy profiles should be singled out as appropriate.
If uπ1 (tπ1 , fπ2 (tπ1 )) uπ1 (sπ1 , sπ2 ) for all tπ1 sπ1 , return f .
Figure 3 shows the extensive form associated with the game of  Figure 2.
Then, top-left is the solution obtained by iterative elimination of strongly  dominated strategies: for Row, playing top is always better than playing bottom, and assuming that Row will therefore never play bottom, left is always better than right for Col.
He had better make the best of a bad bargain and opt for the left column after all.
Rather, we assume it to be determined by the circumstances, which may force or permit some players to commit earlier and others later.
(Sequential commitment type) A  (sequential) commitment type τ associates with each strategic game G and each ordering π of its players, a tuple Xπ1 , .
3.2 Conditional Commitments Relative to a strategic game (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N) and an  ordering π = (π1, .
Intuitively, this could be understood as that the possibility of violation fatally undermines the credibility of the commitment.
, Xπn , φ is finite whenever Xπi is finite for each i with 1 i n. Thus, the type of unconditional commitments associates with a game and an ordering π of its players the tuple S π1 , .
The backward  induction solution is indicated by dashed lines, the conditional  commitment solution by solid ones.
In this paper all formal definitions are based on strategic games and  orderings of the players only.
Set fπ1 = sπ1 and fπ2 (sπ1 ) = sπ2 , and continue with Step 2.
To get around this problem, one can write down conditional  commitments in the form of rules and define appropriate fixed point constructions, as suggested by Samet [7] and Tennenholtz [12].
In the case of conditional commitments, however, a particular kind of inconsistency can arise.
We call a game finite if for all players i the action set Ai is finite.
Col plays left, and bottom, otherwise.
he moves first, the situation is radically different.
(The horizontal dotted lines do not indicate information sets, but merely indicate which players are to move when.)
In settings involving expected utility, we will generally assume that utility functions represent von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences.

A mixed strategy σi for a player i is a probability distribution over Ai.
Thus, both threats and promises would be strategically void if they were unconditional.
The entries in the matrix indicate the payoffs to Row and Col, respectively.
