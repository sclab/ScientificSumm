In this example the strategic position of Mat is so weak if he is to  commit first, that even the possibility to commit inductively does not strengthen it, whereas, in a similar fashion as with conditional  commitments, Row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and Mat if he is the first to commit.
If the second player to commit plays a mixed strategy that ensures his security level, the first player to commit can do no better than to do so as well [14].
In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional  commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a  payoff of two.
As can readily be observed, in any game, the inductive  commitments of the first two players to commit coincide with their conditional commitments.
5.2 Mixed Commitments Types So far we have merely considered commitments to and on pure strategies.
We found that the strategy profile in which Row chooses bottom and Col and Mat both choose left is not extortionable through conditional commitments.
By means of inductive commitments, however, this is possible.
E.g., if the different agents can submit their mixed conditional  commitments to an independent party, the latter can execute the  randomizations and determine the unique mixed strategy profile that their commitments induce. 
We argued that in order to exact a payoff of two by means of a conditional extortion, Mat would have to lure Row into choosing the bottom row without at the same time putting Col in a position to successfully threaten Row not to choose top.
This, we found, is an impossibility if the players can only make conditional  commitments.
An inductive commitment for player πi+1 is a function mapping each profile of inductive commitments of  players π1 through πi to one of his basic actions.
Let f be the inductive commitment profile such that fRow is Row choosing the bottom row (b), fCol is the column player choosing the left column (l) no matter how Row decides, and fMat is defined such that: fMat fRow, fCol = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ r if fRow = t and fCol (b) = r, l otherwise.
Informally, such commitments would have the form of if you only dare to commit in such and such a way, then I do such and such, otherwise I promise to act so and so.
Using pure conditional commitments, he can ensure a payoff of three, whereas with  unconditional mixed commitments 21 2 would be the most he could achieve.
5.1 Inductive Commitments Apart from making commitments conditional on the actions of the players to commit later, one could also commit on the  commitments of the following players.
We find that they are generally quite incomparable with their pure counterparts: in some situations a player can achieve more using a mixed commitment, in another using a pure commitment type.
Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game.
This holds for all players if Row commits first, Col second and Mat last, be it that in this case Mat obtains the best payoff he can get.
Hence, as an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.6, it can never harm to be the first to commit to an inductive commitment in the two player case.
If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however, this is a possibility.
The type of mixed unconditional commitments associates with each game G and ordering π of its players the  tuple Σπ1 , .
Recall that the reason of this failure is that any effort to deter Row from choosing the top row is flawed, as it would put Col in an excellent position to threaten Row not to choose the bottom row.
Formally we define the type of inductive commitments Fπ1 , .
With the former, a player can condition his mixed  strategies on the mixed strategies of the players to commit after him.
The  inductive commitments available to π1 coincide with the actions that are available to him.
Similarly, we find that the game depicted in Figure 7 also serves as an example showing that, in case there are more than two players, it is not  always better to commit to an inductive commitment early.
Analogous to conditional and inductive commitments one can also define the types of mixed conditional and mixed inductive  commitments.
The definition also provides for types of commitment that allow for committing on commitments, thus achieving a finer adjustment of promises and threats.
For a strategic game G and an ordering π of the players, we  define the inductive commitments of the players inductively.
Yet, Mat can still force Row to choose the bottom row, in case Col desists form making this threat.
For one, when one"s commitments are conditional on a particular mixed strategy being played, how can it be recognized that it was in fact this mixed  strategy that was played rather than another one?
A natural extension would be also to consider  commitments to and on mixed strategies.
To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 5.
Instead of showing formally that f is an inductive extortion of the strategy profile (b, l, l), we point out informally how this can be done.
Conceptually, it might not be immediately clear how such mixed conditional commitments can be made with credibility.
By purely  committing to the left column, Col player entices Row to play bottom, as his expected utility then amounts to 3.
Again committing to a mixed strategy will not achieve much for Mat if he is to move first, and as before the other players have no reason to commit to anything other than a pure strategy.
As a matter of fact, von Neumann"s  famous minimax theorem shows that for two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter which player commits first.
We now find that in case the players can  dispose of unconditional mixed strategies, Mat is in a much similar position.
To appreciate this, consider once more the game in Figure 7.
A possible answer would be, that all depends on the circumstances in which the commitments were made.
We distinguish between  conditional, unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments.
However, a player is not always better off with unconditional mixed commitments than with pure conditional commitments.
The expected payoff of Col does not exceed 21 2 , either, in case Row chooses top.
If this proves to be impossible, how can one know how his conditional commitments is to be effectuated?
, fπi−1 , for each player πi and have f denote the pure strategy profile fπ1 , .
Similarly, it subsumes commitments on and to mixed strategies.
By contrast, if Mat can commit to commitments, he can undermine Col"s efforts to threaten Row by playing the right  matrix, if Col were to do so.
Then, Row"s expected utility is 21 2 if he plays the top row, no matter how Col randomizes.
A complicating factor with mixed commitment types is that they 114 The Sixth Intl.
This ensures an expected utility of three for Col as well.
, Fπn , such that for each player πi in a game G and given π: Fπ1 =df.
This makes that the distinction between promises and threats, as delineated in Section 4.1, gets blurred for mixed commitment types.
Conditional and unconditional commitments are only two  possible commitment types.
For an example, consider the game in Figure 2.
Inductive commitments have a greater extortionate power than conditional commitments.
Let fπi = fπi fπ1 , .
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) can result in a mixed strategy profile being played.
A Fπ1 ×···×Fπi πi+1 .
He could randomize uniformly between the left and right matrix.
These tend to be very large objects and, knowing little about them yet, we shelve their formal analysis for future research.
In this section we comment on some of these possibilities.
