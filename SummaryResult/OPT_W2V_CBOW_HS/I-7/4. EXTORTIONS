, xπn ) is a τ-extortion in G given π if and only if there is some benign backward induction f in G∗ given πR with f = (xπn , .
For the type of conditional commitments we have that any  conditional commitment profile f is an extortion of order 0 and an  extortion of an order m greater than 0 is any extortion of order m − 1 for which: gπ1 , .
A benign  backward induction of order 0 is any conditional commitment profile f subject to π.
, xπ1 ) in G. We now find that the extortions of G can be retrieved as the paths of the benign backward induction solutions of the game G∗ for the ordering πR of the players, provided that the commitment type is finite.
A τ-extortion is a commitment profile that is a τ-extortion of order m for all m with 0 m n.  Furthermore, we say that a (mixed) strategy profile σ is τ-extortionable if there is some τ-extortion x with φ(x) = s. Thus, an extortion of order 1 is a commitment profile in which player π1, makes a commitment that maximizes his payoff, given fixed commitments of the other players.
(Benign backward induction) Let G be a strategic game and π an ordering of its players.
We show by induction that (xπ1 , .
, f (∗) π1 ) = (gπn , .
, xπn ) for a player i in G∗ can then be equated to his utility of the strategy profile φ(xπn , .
A conditional commitment profile f is a benign backward induction if it is a benign backward induction of order k for each k with 0 k n. For games with a finite action set for each player, the  following result follows straightforwardly from Kuhn"s Theorem (cf.
Further let f be an extortion of G in which i commits first, and g an extortion in which i commits second.
Therefore, although every extortion can be seen as a benign backward induction in a larger game, it is not the case that all formal properties of extortions are shared by benign backward inductions in general. 
An extortion of order m is an extortion of order m − 1 that maximizes player m"s payoff, given fixed commitments of the players πm+1 through πn.
, f (∗) π1 ) , signifying that f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m. As an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.4 and Fact 4.3 we also have the following result.
The correspondence between the backward induction solutions in the meta-game and the extortions of the original  strategic game rather signifies that the concept of an extortion is defined properly.
For each finite game and each ordering of the  players, benign backward inductions exist.
Moreover, any strategy profile that Pareto dominates an extortion is also extortionable through a conditional commitment.
We prove by induction on m, that f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m, for each m with 0 m n. The basis is trivial.
Let f be a conditional extortion in G given π.
To appreciate that f is not, consider the conditional commitment profile h in which Row chooses top and Col chooses right no matter how Row decides, i.e., h is such that hRow = t and hCol(t) = hCol(b) = r. Then, (hRow, hCol, fMat) is also an extortion of order 1, but yields Col a higher payoff than f does.
Then, a  πcommitment profile (xπ1 , .
Hence, f ≺j h , contradicting the assumption that f is an extortion in G given π. Theorem 4.6 does not generalize to games with more than two players.
It follows that: (gπn , .
From the strategy profiles that can still be realized given the conditional commitments of players that have  committed before him, a player tries to enforce the strategy profile that yields him as much payoff as possible.
For m > 0, a commitment profile x ∈ Xπ1 × · · · × Xπn is a τ-extortion of order m in G given π if x is an τ-extortion of order m − 1 with φ yπ1 , .
We extend this terminology to conditional commitment profiles by saying that a conditional commitment profile f is (weakly) Pareto efficient or (weakly) Pareto dominates another conditional commitment profile if f is or does so.
Since, in virtue of Fact 4.5, extortions  generally exists in each game, it suffices to recognize that the second claim holds.
Now consider a conditional commitment profile h for G and π such that hj(a) = b∗ , for all a ∈ Ai.
Intuitively it reflects the idea that each player chooses for each possible combination of actions of his  predecessors the action that yields the highest payoff, given that his successors do similarly.
A player should also take into  account the commitments, promises and threats the following players can make on the basis of his and his predecessors" commitments.
Hence, he chooses his  commitment so as to render deviations from the path that leads to this strategy profile as unattractive as possible (‘threats") and the  desired strategy profile as appealing as possible (‘promises") for the relevant players.
The higher the payoff is to the other players in a strategy profile a player aims for, the easier it is for him to formulate an  effective threat.
However, if Mat is last to commit and Row first, then the latter can exploit his strategic powers, threaten Col so that she plays left, and guarantee both himself and Mat a payoff of two.
Figure 6 depicts the possible conditional commitments of the players in extensive forms, with the left branch corresponding to Row"s strategy of playing the top row.
In short, no matter how Mat conditionally commits, he will either enable Col to threaten Row into playing top or fail to lure Row into playing the bottom row.
For higher types of commitment, such as conditional commitments, such  ‘metagames", however, grow exponentially in the number of strategies available to the players and are generally much larger than the  original game.
(Otherwise we could define (gj, gi) such that gj = fj(fi), gi(gj) = fi, and for any other b ∈ Aj, gi(b) = a∗ , where a∗ is an action in Ai such that (b, a∗ ) j f .

In virtue of the induction hypothesis, there is a benign backward induction g of order m − 1 in G∗ with g = (xπn , .
For the induction step, consider an arbitrary commitment profile (yπ1 , .
For m > 0, a conditional commitment strategy  profile f is a benign backward induction (solution) of order m if f is a benign backward induction of order m − 1 and (gπR n , .
Let  further the conditional extortion f be Pareto dominated by s. An extortion g with g = s can then be constructed by adopting all threats of f while promising g .
In general, solutions of benign backward inductions can be Pareto dominated by outcomes that are no benign backward induction solutions.
Assume for a contradiction that there is no such extortion of order 1 in G given π .
(Extortions) Let G be a strategic game, π an ordering of its players, and τ a commitment type.
We may conclude that x is an extortion of order m. For the only if direction, assume that x is an extortion of G given π.
, xπn ) is an extortion of order m, for all m with 0 m n. For m = 0, the proof is trivial.
In each game, Pareto efficient conditional  extortions exist.
, sπn ) is such a desirable strategy  profile for player πi and fπi his conditional commitment, the value of fπi (sπ1 , .
, yπn ) such that (yπ1 , .
First we define the concept of benign backward  induction in general relative to a game in strategic form together with an ordering of the players.
For example, in the game of Figure 5, there is no conditional extortion that ensures Mat a payoff of two.
, f (∗) π1 ) = (xπn , .
4.3 Commitment Order In the case of unconditional commitments, it is not always  favorable to be the first to commit.
For each game, each ordering of its players and each  commitment type, we can define another game G∗ with the the actions of each player i given by his τ-commitments Xi in G. The utility 112 The Sixth Intl.
The latter"s extortionate powers relative Col, however, are very weak if he is to commit first: any conditional commitment he makes puts Col in a situation in which she can enforce a  payoff of two, leaving Mat and Row in the cold with a payoff of one.
The actions of the players in any such extensive form game are then given by their conditional  commitments, which they then choose sequentially.
If Mat commits to the right matrix in both cases, he  virtually promises Row a payoff of four, leaving himself with a payoff of at most one.
We say that a strategy profile s (weakly) Pareto dominates another strategy  profile t if t i s for all players i and s it for some.
Otherwise, he puts Col in a position to deter Row from choosing bottom by threatening to choose the right column if the latter does so.
As f is also a benign backward induction of order m: (gπn , .
To appreciate this,  consider the possible commitments Mat can make in case Row plays top and Col plays left (tl) and in case Row plays top and Col plays right (tr).
, xπ1 ), for some commitment profile (xπ1 , .
In both f and g Row guarantees himself the higher payoff given the conditional commitments of Mat and Col. Only g, however, is also an extortion of order 2.
So assume that f (∗) is a backward induction of order m − 1 in G∗ given πR and consider an arbitrary benign backward induction g of order m − 1 in G∗ given πR .
A complicating factor is that in finding a player"s optimal commitment, one should not only take into account how such a commitment affects other players" actions, but also how it enables them to make their commitments.
4.2 Benign Backward Induction The solutions extortions provide can also be obtained by  modeling the situation as an extensive form game and applying a  backward inductive type of argument.
As the reasoning takes place under the assumption that x is an extortion in G given π, we also have: φ(yπ1 , .
Extortions are meant to capture the concept of a profile that contains, for each player, an  optimal commitment given the commitments of the players that  committed earlier.
, yπn ) is an extortion of order m − 1 in G given π.
Rather, we find that it can never harm to move first in a two-player game with conditional commitments.

Let  further hi be such that (a, hj) i (hi, hj) , for all a ∈ Ai.
, f (∗) π1 ) = (f (∗) πn , .
I.e., for all players πi we have gπi (sπ1 , .
Here, we introduce for each commitment type a  corresponding notion of extortion, which is defined relative to a  strategic game and an ordering of the players.
Then, (xπn , .
, xπn for all commitment profiles g in X with (yπ1 , .
Assume that f is a benign backward induction in G∗ relative to πR .
How well they can do, could be analyzed by means of an extensive game with the actions of each player being defined as the possible commitments he can make.
The concept is called benign backward  induction, because it implies that a player, when indifferent between a number of actions, chooses the one that benefits his  predecessors most.
It suffices to show that there is some conditional extortion h of  order 1 in G given π with h = f .
Moreover, a strategy profile s is (weakly) Pareto efficient if it is not (weakly) Pareto dominated by any other strategy profile.
For an ordering π of the players, we have πR denote its reversal (πn, .
Let G = (N, (Ai)i∈N, (ui)i∈N) be a game and π an ordering of its players with which the finite commitment type τ associates the tuple Xπ1 , .
Let s be the strategy profile (sπ1 , .
Having assumed that h is a benign backward induction,  subsequently, (gπn , .
, yπ1 , ) ∗ πm (xπn , .
Then, (gπn , .

4.1 Promises and Threats One way of understanding conditional extortions is by  conceiving of them as combinations of precisely one promise and a  number of threats.
Then, h is an extortion of order 1 in G given π.
Then there must be some b∗ ∈ Aj such that f ≺j b∗ , a , for all a ∈ Ai.
As s Pareto dominates f , the threats of f remain effective as threats of g given that s is being promised.
If, on the other hand, the players are in a position to make conditional commitments in this particular game, moving first is an advantage.
In virtue of Fact 4.3, there is a benign backward induction h in G∗ given πR .
, yπ1 ) ∗ πm (xπn , .
Hence, (xπn , .
, xπn ) is an extortion of order m − 1.
, sπi−1 ) could be taken as his promise, whereas the  values of fπi for all other (tπ1 , .
In particular, this result holds if the players" actions are commitments of a finite type.
Both f and g are extortions of order 1.
4.4 Pareto Efficiency Another issue concerns the Pareto efficiency of the strategy  profiles extortionable through conditional commitments.
Hence, f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m. In the former case the reasoning is slightly different.

Then, τ-extortions exist for each strategic game and for each ordering of the players.
We leave it to the reader to check that, by contrast, g is an extortion of order 3, and therewith an extortion per se.

We prove that there is a benign backward induction f (∗) in G∗ for πR with f (∗) = x.

Let f and g be the conditional commitment strategies indicated by the thick lines in the left and right figures respectively.
