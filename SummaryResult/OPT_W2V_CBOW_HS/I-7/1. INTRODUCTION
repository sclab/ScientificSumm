In this sense, promises and threats essentially involve a commitment on the part of the one who makes them, thus purposely restricting his freedom of choice.
Our approach, however, differs in that it is assumed that the players all move in a  particular order-first, second, third and so on-and that it is specifically aimed at incorporating a wide range of possible commitments, in particular conditional commitments.
In reply to this criticism Schelling remarks: While it is instructive and intellectually satisfying to see how such tactics as threats, commitments, and promises can be absorbed in an enlarged, abstract  supergame (game in normal form), it should be  emphasized that we cannot learn anything about those tactics by studying games that are already in normal form.
156-7] 108 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS Our concern is with these commitment tactics, be it that our  analysis is confined to situations in which the players can commit in a given order and where we assume the commitments the players can make are given.
In this respect, Schelling"s view might seem to evince a more comprehensive understanding of what game theory tries to accomplish.
By commitments we will  understand such limitations of one"s action space.
After briefly discussing related work in Section 2, we present the formal game theoretic framework, in which we define the  notions of a commitment type as well as conditional and unconditional commitments (Section 3).
On this basis we tackle such issues as the usefulness of certain types of commitment in different situations (strategic games) or whether it is better to commit early rather than late.
Promises and threats epitomize one of the fundamental and at first sight perhaps most surprising phenomena in game  theory: it may occur that a player can improve his strategic position by limiting his own freedom of action.
Despite Schelling"s warning for too abstract a framework, our approach will be based on the formal notion of an extortion, which we will propose in Section 4 as a uniform tactic for a comprehensive class of situations in which commitments can be made sequentially.
What we want is a theory that systematizes the study of the various universal ingredients that make up the move-structure of games; too abstract a model will miss them.
One might object, that  commitments could be seen as the actions of a larger game.
In the former setting, the inability to re-program a software agent on the fly can be seen as a commitment to its specification and thus exploited to strengthen its strategic position in a multiagent setting.
Commitments come in different forms and it may depend on the circumstances which ones can and which ones cannot credibly be made.
Apart from merely choosing and performing an action from a set of actions, there may also be other courses open to an agent.
We also provide a framework for the assessment of more  general game theoretic matters like the relationship of extortions to backward induction or Pareto efficiency.
We point out an  equivalence between extortions and backward induction solutions, and investigate whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to Pareto efficiency.
By focusing on the selection of actions rather than on  commitments, it might seem that the conception of game theory as mere interactive decision theory is too narrow.
The potency of a promise, however, essentially depends on the extent the promisee can be convinced of the promiser"s resolve to see to its fulfillment.
Some situations even allow for  commitments on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions.
From this perspective, the formal model of a game in strategic form only outlines the strategic features of an interactive situation.
A mechanism, on the other hand, could be seen as a set of commitments that steers the players" behavior in a certain desired way (see, e.g., [2]).
E.g., the strategic lie of the land may be such that a promise, a threat, or a combination of both would be more conductive to his ends.
Action itself could be seen as the ultimate commitment.
In Section 4 we propose the generic  concept of an extortion, which for each commitment type captures the idea of an optimal commitment profile.
On one view, the least one may expect of game theory is that it provides an answer to the question which actions maximize an agent"s expected utility in situations of interactive decision making.
For example,  commitments have been argued to be of importance for interacting  software agents as well as for mechanism design.
Besides simply committing to the performance of an action, an agent might make his commitment conditional on the actions of other agents, as, e.g., the kidnapper does, when he promises to set free a hostage on receiving a ransom, while threatening to cut off another toe, otherwise.
is not concerned with the efficient application of force but with the exploitation of potential force [9, page 5].
Likewise, a threat only succeeds in deterring an agent if the latter can be made to believe that the threatener is bound to execute the threat, should it be ignored.
These games analyze situations in which a leader commits to a pure or mixed strategy, and a number of followers, who then act simultaneously.
Performing a particular action means doing so to the exclusion of all other actions.
Our analysis is conceptually similar to that of Stackelberg or leadership games [15], which have been extensively studied in the economic literature (cf., [16]).
Insight into these matters has proved itself invaluable for a proper understanding of diplomatic policy during the Cold War.
Nowadays, we believe, these issues are equally significant for  applications and developments in such fields as multiagent systems,  distributed computing and electronic markets.
A slightly divergent view is expounded by Schelling when he states that strategy [.
Section 5 briefly reviews some other  commitment types, such as inductive, mixed and mixed conditional  commitments.
The paper concludes with an overview of the results and an outlook for future research in Section 6.
