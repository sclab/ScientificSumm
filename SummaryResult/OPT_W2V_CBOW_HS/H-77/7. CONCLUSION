All the above investigations were not conducted in previous work, and through our investigations we verified the generality and the significance of the title extraction approach. 
We found that the performance of the Perceptorn models was the best.
In this paper, we showed that the approach can work for extraction from general documents as well.
In this paper, we have investigated the problem of automatically extracting titles from general documents.
We found that the accuracies did not drop substantially across different domains and across different languages, indicating that the models were generic.
Our experimental results indicated that the machine learning approach can work significantly better than the baselines in title extraction from Office documents.
We also attempted to use the extracted titles in document retrieval.
We applied models constructed in one domain to another domain and applied models trained in one language to another language.
We observed a significant improvement in document ranking performance for search when using extracted title information.
Previous work showed that the machine learning approach can work well for metadata extraction from research papers.
We have tried using a machine learning approach to address the problem.
We tried different machine learning models including Perceptron, Maximum Entropy, Maximum Entropy Markov Model, and Voted Perceptron.
Previous work on metadata extraction mainly used linguistic features in documents, while we mainly used formatting information.
It appeared that using formatting information is a key for successfully conducting title extraction from general documents.
