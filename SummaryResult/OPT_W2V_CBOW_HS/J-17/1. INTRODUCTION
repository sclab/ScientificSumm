This is one of the very few known results that use an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem.
The gap between the single-dimensional and multidimensional domains is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that [3] showed that there  exists a truthful mechanism that always outputs an optimal schedule.
Our methods and analyses demonstrate the potential benefits 253 of this characterization, and show that cycle monotonicity can be effectively utilized to devise truthful mechanisms for multidimensional domains.
But for multidimensional domains, almost all positive  results have relied on explicit price specifications in order to prove truthfulness (an exception is the work on unknown single-minded players in combinatorial auctions [17, 7]), a fact that yet again shows the gap in our understanding of multidimensional vs. single-dimensional domains.
The possibility of constructing a truthful mechanism for makespan minimization is strongly related to assumptions on the players" processing times, in particular, the  dimensionality of the domain.
Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem.
It is a generalization of value-monotonicity and completely characterizes truthfulness in every domain.
These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain.
We obtain a deterministic 2-approximation truthful mechanism (along with prices) for this problem.
Shmoys and Tardos [25] later gave a  2approximation algorithm for the generalized assignment  problem, a generalization where there is a cost cij for assigning a job j to a machine i, and the goal is to minimize the cost subject to a bound on the makespan.
The characterization of truthfulness for arbitrary domains in terms of cycle monotonicity seems to have been first  observed by Rochet [23] (see also Gui et al.
Hence, we approach the problem via mechanism  design: the social designer, who holds the set of jobs to be assigned, needs to specify, in addition to a schedule, suitable payments to the players in order to incentivize them to  reveal their true processing times.
On the negative side, [22] showed that no truthful  deterministic mechanism can achieve approximation ratio better than 2, and strengthened this lower bound to m for two  specific classes of deterministic mechanisms.
Instead, it 252 corresponds to maximizing the minimum welfare and the  notion of max-min fairness, and appears to be a much harder problem from the viewpoint of mechanism design.
This model generalizes the  classic restricted machines setting, where pij ∈ {Lj, ∞} which has been well-studied algorithmically.
Assigning a job j to a machine i incurs a load (cost) of pij ≥ 0 on machine i, and the load of a machine is the sum of the loads incurred due to the jobs assigned to it; the goal is to schedule the jobs so as to minimize the  maximum load of a machine, which is termed the makespan of the schedule.
More precisely, in our setting, pij ∈ {Lj, Hj} for every i, j, where the Lj, Hj values are publicly known (Lj ≡low, Hj ≡high).
Complementing this, we observe that even this seemingly simple setting does not admit truthful mechanisms that return an optimal schedule (unlike in the case of related machines).
The algorithmic problem (i.e., without requiring  truthfulness) of makespan-minimization on unrelated machines is well understood and various 2-approximation algorithms are known.
Instead we exploit certain  algorithmic monotonicity conditions that characterize  truthfulness to first design an implementable algorithm, i.e., an  algorithm for which prices ensuring truthfulness exist, and then find these prices (by further delving into the proof of  implementability).
This kind of analysis has been the method of choice in the design of truthful mechanisms for  singledimensional domains, where value-monotonicity yields a  convenient characterization enabling one to concentrate on the algorithmic side of the problem (see, e.g., [3, 7, 4, 1, 13]).
By exploiting the multidimensionality of the domain, we prove that no truthful deterministic mechanism can obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.14 to the makespan (irrespective of computational considerations).
Our work is the first to leverage monotonicity conditions for truthful mechanism design in arbitrary domains.
Our  randomized mechanism is obtained by first constructing a  truthful mechanism that returns a fractional schedule.
Our result implies that there exists a 3-approximation  truthfulin-expectation mechanism for the Lj-Hj setting.
Very few positive results are known for multidimensional domains in general, and the only positive results known for multidimensional scheduling are O(m)-approximation  truthful mechanisms [22, 20].
In stark contrast with the above state of affairs, much stronger (and many more) positive results are known for a special case of the unrelated machines problem, namely, the setting of related machines.
Recently, Mu"alem and Schapira [20] proved a lower bound of 2 on the approximation ratio achievable by truthful-in-expectation mechanisms, and Christodoulou, Koutsoupias, and Vidali [8] proved a (1 + √ 2)-lower bound for deterministic truthful mechanisms.Archer and Tardos [3] first considered the related-machines problem and gave a 3-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.
Algorithmic mechanism design has  focused mainly on settings were the social planner or designer wishes to maximize the social welfare (or equivalently,  minimize social cost), or on auction settings where  revenuemaximization is the main goal.
Our second result applies to the  twovalues setting (Lj = L, Hj = H), for which we improve both the approximation ratio and strengthen the notion of  truthfulness.
A special case of our model is when Lj = L and Hj = H for all jobs j, which we denote simply as the two-values scheduling model.
Following the work of Nisan and Ronen [22], we consider each machine to be a strategic player or agent who privately knows its own processing time for each job, and may misrepresent these values in order to decrease its load (which is its incurred cost).
Thus, in  addition to the specific importance of scheduling in strategic environments, ideas from multidimensional scheduling may also have a bearing in the more general context of truthful mechanism design for multidimensional domains.
Our  construction uses and extends some observations of Lavi and Swamy [16], and further demonstrates the benefits of  fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design.
Truthfulness in such domains is equivalent to a convenient value-monotonicity condition [21, 3], which appears to make it significantly easier to design truthful mechanisms in such domains.
Our first result is a general method to convert any  capproximation algorithm for the job-dependent two values setting into a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation  mechanism.
We emphasize that regardless of computational considerations, even the existence of a  truthful mechanism with a significantly better (than m)  approximation ratio is not known for any such scheduling domain.
The main technique, and one of the novelties,  underlying our constructions and proofs, is that we do not rely on explicit price specifications in order to prove the  truthfulness of our mechanisms.
In this paper, we consider the makespan-minimization problem for a special case of unrelated machines, where the processing time of a job is either low or high on each machine.
[19] showed that the latter objective cannot be implemented truthfully.
In this paper, we consider such an alternative goal in the context of machine scheduling, namely, makespan  minimization.
The monotonicity condition we use, which is sometimes called cycle monotonicity, was first proposed by Rochet [23] (see also [11]).
The makespan-minimization  objective is quite different from the classic goal of social-welfare maximization, where one wants to maximize the total  welfare (or minimize the total cost) of all players.
This is a multidimensional domain, since a player"s private value is its entire vector of processing times (pij)j.
Such difficulties in moving from the single-dimensional to the multidimensional setting also arise in other mechanism design settings (e.g., combinatorial auctions).
Lavi, Mu"alem, and Nisan [15] showed that the former objective cannot be implemented truthfully; Bezakova and Dani [5] gave a 0.5-approximation mechanism for two players with additive valuations.
Consider, for example, our first result showing that any c-approximation algorithm can be exported to a 3c-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.
Moving to a fractional domain allows us to plug-in truthfulness into the approximation algorithm in a rather simple  fashion, while losing a factor of 2 in the approximation ratio.
In the context of combinatorial auctions, the problems of maximizing the minimum value received by a player, and computing an envy-minimizing allocation have been studied briefly.
For convex  domains (i.e., each players" set of private values is convex), it is known that cycle monotonicity is implied by a simpler condition, called weak monotonicity [15, 6, 24].
Such a mechanism is called a truthful mechanism.
Interestingly, the proof of truthfulness is not based on supplying  explicit prices, and our construction does not necessarily yield efficiently-computable prices (but the allocation rule is  efficiently computable).
Mechanism design studies algorithmic constructions  under the presence of strategic players who hold the inputs to the algorithm.
This been improved in [2, 4, 1, 13] to: a 2-approximation  randomized mechanism [2]; an FPTAS for any fixed number of machines given by Andelman, Azar and Sorani [1], and a 3-approximation deterministic mechanism by Kov´acs [13].
(Recall that in the multidimensional unrelated machines setting, it is impossible to obtain a truthful  mechanism with approximation ratio better than 2.)
Nisan and Ronen considered the setting of unrelated machines where the pij values may be  arbitrary.
Both of our domains are multidimensional, since the machines are unrelated: one job may be low on one machine and high on the other, while another job may follow the opposite  pattern.
But even this simpler condition has not found much application in truthful mechanism design for multidimensional problems.
As mentioned earlier, this condition has been  exploited numerous times to obtain truthful mechanisms for single-dimensional domains [3, 7, 4, 1, 13].
We call this model the  jobdependent two-values case.
Archer and Tardos [3] first considered the related machines setting and gave a randomized 3-approximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.
At the level of generality of an arbitrary  approximation algorithm, it seems unlikely that one would be able to come up with prices to prove truthfulness of the constructed mechanism.
In  particular, the celebrated VCG [26, 9, 10] family of mechanisms does not apply here, and we need to devise new techniques.
This preserves truthfulness, but we lose another additive factor equal to the approximation ratio.
Thus, the private information of each machine is a vector specifying which jobs are low and high on it.
Alternative optimization goals, such as those that incorporate fairness criteria (which have been investigated algorithmically and in social choice theory), have received very little or no attention.
Makespan minimization is a common objective in scheduling environments, and has been well studied  algorithmically in both the Computer Science and Operations Research communities (see, e.g., the survey [12]).
The method for converting approximation algorithms into truthful mechanisms involves another novel idea.
We use their procedure in our randomized mechanism.
In fact, some such condition based only on the underlying algorithm (and not on the prices) seems necessary to prove such a general statement.
Our Results and Techniques We present various  positive results for our multidimensional scheduling domains.
This  generalizes the value-monotonicity condition for single-dimensional domains which was given by Myerson [21] and rediscovered by [3].
There are n jobs or tasks that need to be assigned to m machines, where each job has to be assigned to exactly one machine.
Lenstra, Shmoys and Tardos [18] gave the first such algorithm.
Various follow-up results [2, 4, 1, 13] have strengthened the notion of truthfulness and/or improved the approximation ratio.
Related Work Nisan and Ronen [22] first considered the makespan-minimization problem for unrelated machines.
Recently, Kumar, Marathe, Parthasarathy, and Srinivasan [14] gave a  randomized rounding algorithm that yields the same bounds.
But, cycle monotonicity does allow us to prove such a statement.
[14] that is tailored for unrelated-machine scheduling.
Here, we have pij = pj/si for every i, j, where pj is public knowledge, and the speed si is the only private parameter of machine i.
Recently, [20]  extended this lower bound to randomized mechanisms, and [8] improved the deterministic lower bound.
This  assumption makes the domain of players" types single-dimensional.
They gave an m-approximation positive result and proved various lower bounds.
We then use a suitable randomized rounding procedure to convert the fractional assignment into a random integral  assignment.
Objectives other than social-welfare maximization and  revenue maximization have received very little attention in  mechanism design.
These lower bounds were strengthened in [20]. 
For this, we use a recent rounding procedure of Kumar et al.
Lipton et al.
