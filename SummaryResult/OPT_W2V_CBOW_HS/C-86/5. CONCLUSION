Fully realizing these gains, however, requires addressing key problems in  strategyproof mechanism design and combinatorial optimization.
Nevertheless, we  remain optimistic and believe that a pragmatic mix of theory and practice combined with iterative improvements on real deployments provides one promising avenue toward bringing market-based resource allocation into the mainstream. 
The dual observations of significant resource contention and a wide range of valuations suggest that auction-based schemes can deliver large improvements in aggregate utility when compared to traditional approaches such as proportional share allocation or batch scheduling.
The temporal nature of computational resources and the combinatorial resource demands of distributed applications adds an additional layer of complexity.
Despite initially using a repeated combinatorial auction known not to be strategyproof, Mirage has shown significant promise as a vehicle for SensorNet testbed allocation.
