The links between indepence-based noise as document frequency, probabilistic interpretation of idf , information theory and Poisson described in this paper may lead to variable  probabilistic idf and tf definitions and combinations as required in advanced and personalised information retrieval systems.
We showed that the classical definition of the noise (document frequency) in the inverse document frequency can be explained by three assumptions: the term within-document occurrence  probability is binary, the document containment probability is constant, and the document containment events are disjoint.
of documents in a collection, or the different nature of terms (coverage, importance,  position, etc.)
The definition of the probability of being informative  transforms the informative interpretation of the idf into a  probabilistic interpretation, and we can use the idf -based  probability in probabilistic retrieval approaches.
We discussed that the absence of those parameters is compensated by a leverage effect of the within-document term occurrence probability and the document containment probability.
The explicit and mathematical formulation of idf - and Poisson-assumptions is the main result of this paper.
By applying an independence rather a disjointness  assumption for the document containment, we could  establish a link between the noise probability (term occurrence in a collection), information theory and Poisson.
From the frequency-based and the Poisson-based probabilities of  being noisy, we derived the frequency-based and Poisson-based probabilities of being informative.
This theoretical framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter  estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models.
We showed how to smoothen the radical behaviour of Poisson with a  multidimensional Poisson.
By explicitly and mathematically formulating the  assumptions, we showed that the classical definition of idf does not take into account parameters such as the different nature (size, quality, structure, etc.)
in a document.
The frequency-based  probability is relatively smooth whereas the Poisson probability is radical in distinguishing between noisy or not noisy, and informative or not informative, respectively.
Also, the paper emphasises the duality of idf and tf , collection space and document space, respectively.
Thus, the result applies to term occurrence and document containment in a collection, and it applies to term occurrence and position containment in a document.
My thanks also go to the meta-reviewer who advised me to improve the presentation to make it less formidable and more accessible for those without a theoretic bent.
