We then analyze in  detail the auctioneer"s matching problem.
A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk  exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum.
The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents" and  auctioneer"s optimization problems.
We develop a framework for trading in compound securities: financial instruments that pay off contingent on the  outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic.
We show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Î£p 2-complete in the indivisible case.
We develop and motivate the concept of a compound  securities market, presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples.
Buying or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit (in expectation) on subjective predictions.
With log n events, the  problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case.
We briefly discuss matching algorithms and tractable special cases.
We show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe language restrictions on bids.
