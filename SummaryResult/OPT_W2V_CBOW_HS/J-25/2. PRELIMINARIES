Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on  individual securities.
Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.
Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments  cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore  conditions under which a smaller securities market may be  operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto  optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.
One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions  possible.
Then the  existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a  complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth  arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.
do not consider several complicating factors  specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.
Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n  compound events.
For example, CVT may  allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT won"t allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .
In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].
At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic  scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.
While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the  divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the  divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.
2.1 Background and notation Imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain events of any consequence: (1) the event that one"s house is struck by lightning by December 31, 2003, denoted struck, and (2) the event that Acme"s stock price goes above $100 by January 4, 2004, denoted acme100.
Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and  exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science  literatures.
In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible  combinations of the binary events" outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.
If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].
In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.
Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or  illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.
They show that, if all agents" risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is  operationally complete.
The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage  opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.
In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.
CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.
Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic  inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3.
The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.
If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed  simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of  orders.
Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.
For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market.
There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an  analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.
Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.
For example,  insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number.
The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the  compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.
Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.
Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.
The  mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patron"s payment is bounded.
Often a more natural way to think of possible future  outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.
Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.
Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.
Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).
In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a  scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its  probability distribution.
In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).
Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.
Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acme"s price is above $100 on January 4 to states where it"s not.
2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrow"s original work [1].
Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for  representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.
In this way bidders can express  substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.
Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.
145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be  constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the  missing securities with options.
ing one"s house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.
Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.
For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.
2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the  vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are  linearly independent.
Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place  distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.
Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo [9] give a sound and  complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of  probabilistic inequalities are consistent.
Still, the number of linearly  independent financial instruments-securities plus  optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.
Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand,  allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.
In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for  completeness is intractable.
So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.
Typically, 3 Specifically, one unit of each pays off $2 iff both A and B occur, $1 iff A or B occurs (but not both), and $0 otherwise.
If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.
The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential  trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and  allocation.
For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.
The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.
The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint  probability distributions [23].
uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered.
Agents optimize based on their own  subjective probabilities and risk attitude (and in general, their  beliefs about other agents" beliefs and utilities, ad infinitum).
The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the  bidder"s and auctioneer"s point of view.
Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.
Note that a set of n  linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.
All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω,  consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.
Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.
No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.
The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare.
However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al.
We address these issues  below.
