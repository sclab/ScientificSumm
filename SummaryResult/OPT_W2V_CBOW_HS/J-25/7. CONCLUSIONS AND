A natural question is to determine whether a market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances this may occur.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have analyzed the computational complexity of  matching for securities based on logical formulas.
We may consider a market to be in computational  equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find a strategy that increases utility.
Although matching is likely intractable, are there good heuristics that achieve matches in many cases or  approximate a matching?
• How do make the above choices in a game  theoretically sound way, taking into account the choices of other traders, their reasoning about other traders, etc.
Exploring sharing rules for dividing the surplus, and incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms.
153 • How to choose securities; that is, deciding on what collection of boolean formulas to offer to trade, subject to constraints or penalties on the number or complexity of bids.
Analyzing the agents" optimization problem: • How to choose quantities and bid/ask prices for a collection of securities to maximizes one"s  expected utility, both for linear and nonlinear utility functions.
Many possible avenues for future work exist, including 1.
With few exceptions [3, 22], little is known about computational  equilibriums.
