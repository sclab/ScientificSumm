The straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible matching problem is linear programming; we set up an  appropriate linear program in Section 5.1.
The straightforward algorithm for solving the indivisible matching problem is  integer programming.
For example, in some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction techniques, without writing down the full payoff vectors.
With n events, to set up the  appropriate linear or integer programs, simply writing out the payoff vectors in the straightforward way requires O(2n ) space.
There is some hope that specialized algorithms that  exploit structure among bids can perform better in terms of average-case time and space complexity.
Formalizing a logical-reduction algorithm for matching, or other algorithms that can exploit special  structure among the bids, is a promising avenue for future work. 
So a match between the following bids: • sell 1 of A1A2 at $0.2 • sell 1 of A1 ¯A2 at $0.1 • buy 1 of A1 at $0.4 can be identified by reducing the first two bids to an  equivalent offer to sell A1 at $0.3 that clearly matches with the third bid.
