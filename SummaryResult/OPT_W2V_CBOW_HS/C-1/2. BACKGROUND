A recommended deployment scenario proposed by the UDDI V3.0.2 Specification is to use the UDDI Business Registries as root registries, and it is possible to enable this using our solution.
To attain scalability, Index services from different Globus containers can register with each other in a hierarchical fashion to aggregate data.
Although there are different ways of doing this, the web services standards committees address this requirement through a specification called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).
The implementation of the web service version of the Monitoring and Discovery Service (WS MDS), also known as the MDS4 component of the Globus Toolkit version 4 (GT4), includes such a registry in the form of the Index service Resource and service properties are collected and indexed by this service.
In fact, the only known uses of UDDI are what are known as private UDDI registries within an enterprise"s boundaries.
Green pages represent the technical information that is necessary to invoke a given service.
Bamboo, like all DHTs, specifies algorithms to be followed when a node joins the overlay network, or when a node fails or leaves the network The geometry must be maintained even when this rate is high.
2.3 Distributed Hash Tables A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed system that forms a structured overlay allowing more efficient routing than the underlying network.
UDDI V3 provides larger support for multi-registry environments based on portability of keys By allowing keys to be re-registered in multiple registries, the ability to link registries in various topologies is effectively enabled.
The identifier space is assigned to the nodes in a distributed and deterministic fashion, so that routing and lookup can be performed efficiently.
The routing table entry at row i and column j, denoted Ri[j], is another node whose identifier matches its own in first i digits, and whose (i + 1)st digit is j.
The nodes of a DHT maintain links to some of the other nodes in the DHT.
2.2 UDDI Beyond grid computing, the problem of service discovery needs to be addressed more generally in the web services community.
For example, in the Bamboo DHT [11], and in the Pastry DHT [8] on which Bamboo is based, nodes maintain links to neighboring nodes and to other distant nodes found in a routing table.
UDDI"s intent is to function as a registry for services just as the yellow pages is a registry for businesses.
For our deployment, a key is the hash of a keyword from a service name or description.
Thus, by browsing a UDDI registry, a developer should be able to locate a service and a company and find out how to invoke the service.
The DHT keys are obtained from a large identifier space.
Specifically, this approach is not a good match for systems that try to exploit the convergence of grid and peer-to-peer computing [5].
Just like in Yellow pages, companies register themselves and their services under different categories.
Nodes in a DHT are also mapped into the same identifier space by applying the hash function to their identifier, such as IP address and port number, or public key.
The readers can refer to [7] for a recent article that discusses the shortcomings of UDDI and the properties of an ideal service registry.
Again, scalability is a major concern since millions of buyers looking for specific services need to find all the potential sellers of the service who can meet their needs.
This has to be done with robustness because of the transient nature of nodes in P2P systems.
A hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, is applied to an object name to obtain its DHT key.
A UDDI registry enables a business to enter three types of information in a UDDI registry - white pages, yellow pages and green pages.
In the architecture presented in [6], the service discovery function is assigned to a specialized Grid service called Registry.
However, no normative description of these topologies is provided in the UDDI specification at this point.
To attain consistent routing or lookup, a DHT key must be routed to the node with the numerically closest identifier.
This approach for attaining scalability works best in hierarchical Virtual Organizations (VO), and expanding a search to find sufficient number of matches involves traversing the hierarchy.
It maintains a collection of key-value pairs on the nodes participating in this graph structure.
In UDDI, White Pages are a listing of the business entities.
Just like any other hash table data structure, it provides a simple interface consisting of put() and get() operations.
Its basic function makes it similar to UDDI registry.
However, UDDI today has issues that have not been addressed, such as scalability and autonomy of individual registries.
There will be multiple values for this key, one for each service containing the keyword.
The value stored in the DHT can be any object or a copy or reference to it.
The improvements within UDDI V3 that allow support for multi-registry environments are significant and open the possibility for additional research around how  multiregistry environments may be deployed.
The pattern of these links is known as the DHT"s geometry.
2.1 Grid Service Discovery Grid computing is based on standards which use web services technology.
When UDDI was initially offered, it provided a lot of potential.
For details of how the routing tables are constructed and maintained, the reader is referred to [8, 11]. 
However, today we find that UDDI has not been widely deployed in the Internet.
The routing table allows efficient overlay routing.
Improvement of the UDDI standard is continuing in full force and UDDI version 3 (V3) was recently approved as an OASIS Standard.
