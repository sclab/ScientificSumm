In this paper we will present an  argumentation framework for learning agents, and show that it can be used for two purposes: (1) joint deliberation, and (2) learning from communication.
Thus, we  consider a scenario with agents that (1) work in the same domain using a shared ontology, (2) are capable of learning from examples, and (3) communicate using an argumentative framework.
In this paper, we focus on an Argumentation-based Multi-Agent Learning (AMAL) framework where both knowledge and preference relation are learned from experience.
The agents use case-based reasoning (CBR) [1] to learn from past cases (where a case is a situation and its outcome) in order to predict the outcome of a new situation.
Most existing argumentation frameworks for multi-agent  systems are based on deductive logic or some other deductive logic formalism specifically designed to support argumentation, such as default logic [3]).
We propose an  argumentation protocol inside the AMAL framework at supports agents in reaching a joint prediction over a specific situation or problem - moreover, the reasoning needed to support the argumentation process will also be based on cases.
Section 2 discusses the  relation among argumentation, collaboration and learning.
Moreover, learning agents allow techniques that use learnt experience to generate adequate  arguments and counterarguments.
Specifically, we will need to address two issues: (1) how to define a technique to generate arguments and counterarguments from examples, and (2)how to define a  preference relation over two conflicting arguments that have been  induced from examples.
Finally, we  evaluate (1) if argumentation between learning agents can produce a joint prediction that improves over individual learning performance and (2) if learning from the counterexamples conveyed during the argumentation process increases the individual performance with precisely those cases being used while arguing among them.
After that, Section 8 presents an  exemplification of the argumentation framework.
Argumentation frameworks for multi-agent systems can be used for different purposes like joint deliberation, persuasion,  negotiation, and conflict resolution.
Learning agents are capable of  learning from experience, in the sense that past examples (situations and their outcomes) are used to predict the outcome for the situation at hand.
In particular, we present two case-based measures, one for generating the arguments and  counterarguments adequate to a particular situation and another for  determining preference relation among arguments.
Then  Section 3 introduces our multi-agent CBR (MAC) framework and the notion of justified prediction.
Having learning capabilities allows agents effectively use a  specific form of counterargument, namely the use of  counterexamples.
Thus, learning agents that are capable of arguing their individual predictions with other agents may reach better prediction accuracy after such an argumentation process.
However, logic-based argumentation frameworks assume agents with preloaded knowledge and  preference relation.
Sections 5 and 6 present our case-based preference relation and argument generation policies  respectively.
Usually, an argument is seen as a logical  statement, while a counterargument is an argument offered in opposition to another argument [4, 13]; agents use a preference relation to  resolve conflicting arguments.
Later, Section 7 presents the argumentation protocol in our AMAL framework.
Argumentation-based joint deliberation involves discussion over the outcome of a particular situation or the appropriate course of  action for a particular situation.
After that, Section 4 formally  defines our argumentation framework.
Counterexamples offer the possibility of agents learning  during the argumentation process.
This paper presents a case-based approach to address both  issues.
Finally, Section 9 presents an empirical evaluation of our two main hypotheses.
However, since individual agents experience may be  limited, individual knowledge and prediction accuracy is also limited.
The paper is structured as follows.
The paper closes with related work and conclusions sections.
