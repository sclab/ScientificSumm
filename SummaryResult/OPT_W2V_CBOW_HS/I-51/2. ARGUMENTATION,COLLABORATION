In this paper we will propose AMAL, an argumentation  framework for learning agents, and will also also show how AMAL can be used both for learning from communication and for solving  problems in a collaborative way: • Agents can solve problems in a collaborative way via  engaging an argumentation process about the prediction for the situation at hand.
AND LEARNING Both learning and collaboration are ways in which an agent can improve individual performance.
Let us show which are the main motivations that an agent can have to learn or to collaborate.
An agent may choose to increase  performance by learning, by collaborating, or by finding an intermediate point that combines learning and collaboration in order to improve performance.
In fact, there is a clear parallelism between learning and collaboration in multi-agent systems, since both are ways in which agents can deal with their shortcomings.
Using this collaboration, the prediction can be done in a more informed way, since the information known by several agents has been taken into account.
In the rest of this paper we will propose an argumentation  framework and show how it can be used both for learning and for solving problems in a collaborative way. 
Looking at the above lists of motivation, we can easily see that learning and collaboration are very related in multi-agent systems.
In fact, with the exception of the last item in the motivations to collaborate list, they are two extremes of a continuum of strategies to improve performance.
Agents that engage in such argumentation processes can learn from the  arguments and counterexamples received from other agents, and use this information for predicting the outcomes of future  situations.
• Motivations to learn: - Increase quality of prediction, - Increase efficiency, - Increase the range of solvable problems.
• Agents can also learn from communication with other agents by engaging an argumentation process.
• Motivations to collaborate: - Increase quality of prediction, - Increase efficiency, - Increase the range of solvable problems, - Increase the range of accessible resources.
