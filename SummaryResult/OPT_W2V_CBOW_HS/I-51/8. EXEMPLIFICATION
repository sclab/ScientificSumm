A3 generates a  counterargument β2 3 = A3, P, hadromerida, D6 for α0 2 and sends it to A2 with the message rebut(β2 3 , α0 2).
Therefore, A2 accepts the counterargument and informs the rest of the agents with the message assert(β2 3 ).
In particular, in this example: • α0 1 = A1, P, hadromerida, D1 • α0 2 = A2, P, astrophorida, D2 • α0 3 = A3, P, axinellida, D3 A1 starts owning the token and tries to generate  counterarguments for α0 2 and α0 3, but does not succeed, however it has one counterexample c13 for α0 3.
At Round 3, since all the agents agree (all the justified  predictions in H3 predict hadromerida as the solution class) The  protocol ends, and A1 (the agent that received the problem) considers hadromerida as the joint solution for the problem P. 
Thus, A1 sends the the message rebut( c13, α0 3) to A3.
A3 comes up with the justified prediction α1 3 = A3, P, hadromerida, D4 , and broadcasts it to the rest of the agents with the message assert(α1 3).
The counterargument is sent to A3 with the message rebut(β1 2 , α1 3).
Agent A3 receives the counterargument and assesses its local  confidence.
Therefore, A3 does not accept the counterargument, and thus H2 = α0 1, α0 2, α1 3 .
The result is that the individual confidence of the  counterargument β1 2 is lower than the local confidence of α1 3.
For that reason, invites A2 and A3 to take part in the argumentation process.
The result is that the local confidence of the counterargument β2 3 is higher than the local confidence of α0 2.
Agent A2 receives the  counterargument and assesses its local confidence.
A2 tries to generate  counterarguments for α0 1 and α1 3 and only succeeds to generate a  counterargument β1 2 = A2, P, astrophorida, D5 against α1 3.
Thus, all of them know the new H1 = α0 1, α0 2, α1 3 .
Round 2 starts and A3 gets the token.
Thus, all of them can compute H0 = α0 1, α0 2, α0 3 .
They accept the invitation, and the argumentation protocol starts.
After that, H3 = α0 1, β2 3 , α1 3 .
Round 1 starts and A2 gets the token.
Initially, each agent generates its individual prediction for P, and broadcasts it to the other agents.
Let us consider a system composed of three agents A1, A2 and A3.
One of the agents, A1 receives a problem P to solve, and  decides to use AMAL to solve it.
A3 incorporates c13 into its case base and tries to solve the problem P again, now taking c13 into consideration.
