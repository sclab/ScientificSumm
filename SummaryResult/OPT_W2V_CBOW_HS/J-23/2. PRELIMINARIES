Given a monotone allocation rule A and a bid vector b, the threshold bid te of an agent e ∈ A(b) is the highest bid of this agent that still wins the auction, given that the bids of other participants remain the same.
In set system auctions, each element e of the ground set is owned by an independent agent and has an associated non-negative cost ce.
The standard requirements are individual rationality, i.e., the payment to each agent should be at least as high as his incurred cost (0 for agents not in the selected set and ce for agents in the 337 selected set) and incentive compatibility, or truthfulness, i.e., each agent"s dominant strategy is to bid his true cost.
A set system is a pair (E, F), where E is the ground set, |E| = n, and F is a collection of feasible sets, which are subsets of E. Two particular types of set systems are of interest to us - shortest path systems, in which the ground set consists of all edges of a network, and the feasible sets are paths between two specified vertices s and t, and vertex cover systems, in which the elements of the ground set are the vertices of a graph, and the feasible sets are vertex covers of this graph.
For set system auctions, this simply means picking a cheapest feasible set, paying each agent in the selected set his threshold bid, and paying 0 to all other agents.
The allocation rule takes as input a vector of bids and decides which of the sets in F should be selected.
The auction proceeds as follows: all elements of the ground set make their bids, the centre selects a feasible set based on the bids and makes payments to the agents.
The goal of the centre is to select (purchase) a feasible set.
An allocation rule is monotone if an agent cannot increase his chance of getting selected by raising his bid.
Formally, for any bid vector b and any e ∈ E, if e ∈ A(b) then e ∈ A(b1, .
The payment rule also takes as input a vector of bids and decides how much to pay to each agent.
Each element e in the selected set incurs a cost of ce.
The VCG mechanism is a truthful mechanism that maximises the social welfare and pays 0 to the losing agents.
The elements that are not selected incur no costs.
[19, 13]) that any auction that has a monotone allocation rule and pays each agent his threshold bid is truthful; conversely, any truthful auction has a monotone allocation rule.
, bn) for any be > be.
Formally, an auction is defined by an allocation rule A : Rn → F and a payment rule P : Rn → Rn .
Note, however, that the VCG mechanism may be difficult to implement, since finding a cheapest feasible set may be intractable.
If U is a set of agents, c(U) denotes P w∈U cw.
Formally, te = sup{be ∈ R | e ∈ A(b1, .
In most of this paper, we discuss auctions for set systems.
Similarly, b(U) denotes P w∈U bw.
It is well known (see, e.g.
