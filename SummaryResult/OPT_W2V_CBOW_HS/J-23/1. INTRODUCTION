While our main result about vertex cover auctions (Theorem 4) is with respect to NTUmin = ν, we make use of the new definitions by first comparing the payment of our mechanism to a weaker bound NTUmax, and then  bootstrapping from this result to obtain the desired bound.
This paper studies an auction that is based on the greedy allocation algorithm, which has an  approximation ratio of log n. While the main focus of [5] is the more general set cover problem, the results of [5] imply a frugality ratio of 2Δ2 for vertex cover.
Both of these papers are based on the definition of frugality ratio used in [1]; as mentioned before, this means that their results only apply to bipartite graphs.
The first (and, to the best of our knowledge, only) paper to investigate polynomial-time truthful mechanisms for vertex cover is [5].
This means that the solution quality of our auction is with a factor of 2 of  optimal and the frugality ratio is within a factor of 4 of the best  possible bound for worst-case inputs.
1.1 Our results Vertex cover auctions We propose a truthful polynomial-time auction for vertex cover that outputs a solution whose cost is within a factor of 2 of optimal, and whose frugality ratio is at most 2Δ, where Δ is the maximum degree of the graph (Theorem 4).
In auctions for other types of set systems, the requirement that there exist a feasible solution  disjoint from the selected one is even more severe: for example, for vertex-cover auctions (where vendors correspond to the vertices of some underlying graph, and the feasible sets are vertex covers) the requirement means that the graph must be bipartite.
A widely-studied class of  setsystem auctions is path auctions, where each vendor is able to sell access to a link in a network, and the feasible sets are those sets whose links contain a path from a given source to a given  destination; the study of these auctions has been initiated in the seminal paper by Nisan and Ronen [19] (see also [1, 10, 9, 6, 15, 7, 20]).
An interesting question in mechanism design is how much the auctioneer will have to overpay in order to ensure truthful bids.
We show (Theorem 1) that for any set system, if there is a cost vector for which TUmin and NTUmin differ by a factor of α, there is another cost vector that separates NTUmin and NTUmax by the same factor and vice versa; the same is true for the pairs (NTUmin, NTUmax) and (NTUmax, TUmax).
In particular, we note that the payment bound ν = NTUmin of [16] exhibits some  counterintuitive properties, such as nonmonotonicity with respect to adding a new feasible set (Proposition 7), and is NP-hard to compute  (Theorem 6), while some of the other payment bounds do not suffer from these problems.
They show that, for a large class of truthful mechanisms for this problem, the frugality ratio is as large as the number of edges in the shortest path.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first auction for this problem that enjoys these  properties.
Our results improve on those of [21] as our mechanism is polynomial-time computable, as well as on those of [5], as our mechanism has a better approximation ratio, and we prove a stronger bound on the frugality ratio; moreover, this bound also applies to the mechanism of [5].
All four payment bounds arise as Nash equilibria of certain games (see the full version of this paper [8]); the differences between them can be seen as the price of initiative and the price of  cooperation (see Section 3).
We complement this result by proving (Theorem 5) that for any Δ and n, there are graphs of maximum degree Δ and size Θ(n) for which any truthful mechanism has frugality ratio at least Δ/2.
A natural goal in this setting is to design a truthful auction, in which vendors have an incentive to bid their true cost.
Based on this new definition, the authors  construct new mechanisms for the shortest path problem and show that the overpayment of these mechanisms is within a constant factor of optimal.
These modifications can be made independently of each other, resulting in four  different payment bounds TUmax, TUmin, NTUmax, and NTUmin, where NTUmin is equal to the original payment bound ν of in [16].
We then show (Theorem 2) that this  separation is almost best possible for general set systems by proving that for any set system TUmax/TUmin ≤ n. In contrast, we  demonstrate (Theorem 3) that for path auctions TUmax/TUmin ≤ 2.
We see this as an argument for the study of  vertexcover auctions, as they appear to be more representative of the  general team -selection problem than the widely studied path auctions.
Based on these bids, the auctioneer selects a feasible subset of vendors, and makes payments to the vendors in this subset.
This observation suggests that the four payment bounds should be  studied in a unified framework; moreover, it leads us to believe that the bootstrapping technique of Theorem 4 may have other applications.
Moreover, we show how to transform any truthful mechanism for the vertex-cover problem into a frugal one while preserving the approximation ratio.
We evaluate the payment bounds introduced here with respect to a checklist of desirable features.
We provide examples (Proposition 5 and Corollaries 1 and 2) showing that for the vertex cover problem any two consecutive bounds can differ by a factor of n − 2, where n is the number of agents.
We assume that each vendor has a cost of providing his services, but submits a possibly larger bid to the auctioneer.
We observe (Proposition 1) that the four payment bounds  always obey a particular order that is independent of the choice of the set system and the cost vector, namely, TUmin ≤ NTUmin ≤ NTUmax ≤ TUmax.
While the definition of frugality ratio proposed by [1] is  wellmotivated and has been instrumental in studying truthful  mechanisms for set systems, it is not completely satisfactory.
However, since finding the cheapest vertex cover is an NP-hard problem, the VCG  mechanism is computationally infeasible.
It is assumed that the buyer"s  requirements can be satisfied by various subsets of the vendors; these subsets are called the feasible sets.
They define the frugality ratio of a  mechanism as the ratio between its total payment and the cost of the cheapest path disjoint from the path selected by the mechanism.
This quantity, which they denote by ν, intuitively corresponds to the value of a cheapest Nash equilibrium.
Inspired by this application, we embark on a further study of these payment bounds.
This can be achieved by paying each selected vendor a premium above her bid in such a way that the vendor has no incentive to overbid.
Talwar [21] extends this definition of frugality ratio to general set systems, and studies the frugality ratio of the classical VCG mechanism [22, 4, 14] for many specific set systems, such as minimum spanning trees and set covers.
This graph is 2-connected and the VCG payment to the winning path ABCD is bounded.
In a set system auction there is a single buyer and many vendors that can provide various services.
However, the graph contains no A-D path that is disjoint from ABCD, and hence the frugality ratio of VCG on this graph remains undefined.
Frugality ratios Our vertex cover results naturally suggest two modifications of the definition of ν in [16].
In the context of path auctions this topic was first addressed by Archer and Tardos [1].
At the same time, there is no monopoly, that is, there is no  vendor that appears in all feasible sets.
Talwar [21] shows that the frugality ratio of VCG is at most Δ.
Each selected vendor enjoys a profit of payment minus cost.
This can be seen as an argument in favour of using weaker but efficiently computable bounds NTUmax and TUmax.
Consider, for example, the graph of Figure 1 with the costs cAB = cBC = A B C D Figure 1: The diamond graph 336 cCD = 0, cAC = cBD = 1.
We provide examples (Propositions 2, 3 and 4) showing that this bound is tight.
Our results here are as follows: 1.
This  symmetry is quite surprising, since, e.g., TUmin and NTUmax are  obtained from NTUmin by two very different transformations.
Vendors want to maximise profit, while the buyer wants to minimise the amount he pays.
[16] suggest a better benchmark, which is defined for any monopoly-free set system.
Related work Vertex-cover auctions have been studied in the past by Talwar [21] and Calinescu [5].
