In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly,  linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents.
In particular, persistence in commitments  introduces into agents" consideration a certain level of  predictability of other agents" actions, which is important when agents deal with issues of inter-dependencies, global constraints or The Sixth Intl.
In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.
The ability to specify choices via the additive connectives is a particularly useful feature of linear logic.
Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].
Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.
Formulas with no temporal operators can be considered as being available only at present.
Once a  precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 
A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both.
In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.
In order to increase the agents" autonomy over their  interactive behaviors, protocols should be specified in terms of what is to be achieved rather than how the agents should act.
In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or  removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources.
Regarding , the choice is an internal choice, as appropriate to one"s own capability.
With , the choice is externally decided by others.
As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (one"s own), and external choices (others" choice).
2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.
A ⊗ (multiplicative conjunction) A, means that one has two As at the same time, which is different from A ∧ A = A.
If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.
A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we don"t know which.
A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.
Indeed, social  commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].
In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.
Using logic is central to this specification process.
Though both and refer to a point in time, the choice of which time is different.
For instance, to specify that the choice of places A or B for goods" delivery is ours as the supplier, we use A B, or is the client"s, we use A ⊕ B.
Completing the  protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment  operations to bring the current state to final states where all  commitments are resolved.
A ℘ (multiplicative disjunction) B, means that if not A then B or vice versa but not both A and B.
In other words, protocols should be specified in a declarative manner.
Commitment based approaches associate protocols actions with operations on commitments and protocol states with the set of effective commitments [11].
From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.
Temporal logic can be used for specification and verification of concurrent and reactive programs [2].
Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.
Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others.
Adding to a formula A, i.e.
Temporal Linear Logic (TLL) [6] is the result of  introducing temporal logic into linear logic and hence is  resourceconscious as well as deals with time.
Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match  consumption and supply of resources among agents can  simplify the specification of resource allocations.
It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].
A means that A can be used once at some time.
2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems.
2.3 Commitment The concept of social commitment has been recognized as fundamental to agent interaction.
Linear logic [3] is well-known for  modeling resources as well as updating processes.
Similarly, A means that A can be used at any time and exactly once.
Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].
A, means that A can be used only at the next time and exactly once.
The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.
This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).
The temporal  operators used are (next), (anytime), and (sometime) [6].
Hence, ⊗ allows a natural expression of proportion.
Hence, the approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal  computations [11].
In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.
