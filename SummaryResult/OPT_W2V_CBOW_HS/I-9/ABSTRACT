A crucial aspect of the development of such methods is the notion of commitments, which provides a mechanism for  coordinating interactive behaviors among agents.
We show how agents can reason about commitments and protocol actions to achieve the end results of protocols using a reasoning  system based on temporal linear logic, which incorporates both temporal and resource-sensitive reasoning.
In this paper, we investigate an approach to model commitments with tight integration with protocol actions.
Interactions between agents in an open system such as the Internet require a significant degree of flexibility.
We also discuss the application of this framework to scenarios such as online commerce.
This means that there is no need to have an explicit mapping from protocols  actions to operations on commitments and an external  mechanism to process and enforce commitments.
