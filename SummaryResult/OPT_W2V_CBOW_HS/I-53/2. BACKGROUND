In this case, a player"s Shapley value is proportional to the contribution it makes as a member of a  coalition; the more contribution it makes, the higher its value.
For each coalition S, the number v(S) is the total payoff that is available for division among the members of S (i.e., the set of joint actions that coalition S can take consists of all possible divisions of v(S) among the members of S).
Shapley defined a value for games to be a function that assigns to a game (N, v), a number ϕi(N, v) for each i in N. This function satisfies three axioms [17]: 1.
Thus, the marginal  contribution of player i to coalition S with i /∈ S is a function Δiv that is defined as follows: Δiv(S) = v(S ∪ {i}) − v(S) Thus a player"s marginal contribution to a coalition S is the  increase in the value of S as a result of i joining it.
If a player"s entry to a coalition changes it from losing to winning, then the player"s marginal contribution for that coalition is one; otherwise it is zero.
The weighted voting game is then a game G = N, v in which: v(S) = j 1 if w(S) ≥ q 0 otherwise for some q ∈ IR+ and wi ∈ IRN + , where: w(S) = X i∈S wi for any coalition S. Thus wi is the number of votes that player i has and q is the number of votes needed to win the game (i.e., the quota).
Suppose that all the players are arranged in some order, all orderings being equally likely.
The focus of this paper is on the weighted voting game (described in Section 2.1) which is a game with transferable payoffs.
Let S denote the set N − {i} and fi : S → 2N−{i} be a random variable that takes its values in the set of all subsets of N − {i}, and has the probability distribution function (g) defined as: g(fi(S) = S) = |S|!
It requires that for any games ϕi(N, v) and ϕi(N, v ), ϕi(N, v)+ϕi(N, v ) = ϕi(N, v + v ) for all i in N. Shapley showed that there is a unique function that satisfies these three axioms.
The problem then is how to split the total payoff between or among the players.
If the players measure utility or the payoff in the same units and there is a means of exchange of utility such as side payments, we say the game has transferable utility; otherwise it has non-transferable utility.
, n}) of players and 2. a function (v) that associates with every non-empty subset S of N (i.e., a coalition) a real number v(S) (the worth of S).
This function is different for different games, but here we focus specifically on the weighted  voting game for the reasons outlined in Section 1.
The random variable fi is interpreted as the random choice of a coalition that player i joins.
Note that for this game (denoted q; w1, .
The Shapley value (ϕi) of the game N, v for player i is the expectation (E) of its marginal contribution to a coalition that is chosen randomly: ϕi(N, v) = E[Δiv ◦ fi] (1) The Shapley value is interpreted as follows.
For the former, each coalition is associated with a set of payoff vectors that is not necessarily the set of all possible divisions of some fixed amount.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 2.1 The weighted voting game We adopt the definition of the voting game given in [6].
We first introduce some notation and then define the Shapley value.
This axiom requires that the sum of ϕi(N, v) for all players i in any carrier C equal v(C).
Then ϕi(N, v) is the expected marginal contribution, over all orderings, of player i to the set of players who precede him.
Hence the game is a competition between coalitions of players, rather than between individual  players.
Alternatively, one can think of the Shapley value as a measure of the utility of risk neutral players in a game.
Then, a player"s Shapley value is  defined in terms of its marginal contribution.
Coalition games with  nontransferable payoffs differ from ones with transferable payoffs in the following way.
A carrier C is a subset of N such that v(S) = v(S ∩ C) for any subset of players S ⊂ N. 3.
The property of uniqueness is desirable because it leaves no ambiguity.
This is because the value of any coalition is either zero or one.
The method for finding a player"s Shapley value depends on the definition of the value function (v).
We begin by introducing coalition games and the Shapley value and then define the weighted voting game.
Thus, in either case, the players will only join a coalition if they expect to gain from it.
Shapley viewed this value as an index for measuring the power of players in a game.
This axiom requires that the names of players play no role in determining the value.
Depending on how the players measure utility, coalition game theory is split into two parts.
More formally, a coalition game with transferable utility, N, v , consists of: 1. a finite set (N = {1, 2, .
A coalition with value zero is called a losing coalition and with value one a winning coalition.
In this context, Shapley [19] constructed a solution using an axiomatic approach.
This axiom specifies how the values of different games must be related to one another.
A coalition game is a game where groups of players (coalitions) may enforce cooperative  behaviour between their members.
Thus, there is a set of n players that may, for example, represent shareholders in a company or members in a parliament.
The property of  fairness relates to how the gains from cooperation are split between the members of a coalition.
Joint Conf.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it gives a  solution that is both unique and fair.
Here, the players are allowed to form  binding agreements, and so there is strong incentive to work together to receive the largest total payoff.
Thus, from a player"s perspective, both uniqueness and fairness are  desirable properties. 
Like a price index or other market indices, the value uses averages (or weighted averages in some of its  generalizations) to aggregate the power of players in their various cooperation opportunities.
