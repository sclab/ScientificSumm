In particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game is #P-complete.
Although this problem is, in general #P-complete, we show that there are some specific voting games for which the Shapley value can be determined in polynomial time and  characterise such games.
In future, we will explore the problem of determining the Shapley value for other commonly occurring coalition games like the  production economy and the market economy. 
For other complex voting games, we presented a new randomized method for  determining the approximate Shapley value.
However, its main problem is that, for many coalition games, the Shapley value cannot be determined in polynomial time.
An important issue in such work is for the agents to decide how to split the gains from cooperation between the  members of a coalition.
The time complexity of the proposed method is linear in the number of players.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique and fair.
Finally, we analyse the effect of the different parameters of the voting game on this error.
By doing so, we have shown when it is  computationally feasible to find the exact Shapley value.
We analysed the performance of this method in terms of the percentage error in the approximate Shapley value.
In this context, cooperative game theory offers a solution concept called the Shapley value.
Given the fact that software agents have limited computational  resources and therefore cannot compute the true Shapley value, our results are especially relevant to such resource bounded agents.
Coalition formation is an important form of interaction in  multiagent systems.
Our study shows that the error decreases as 1. a player"s weight increases, 2. the quota increases, and 3. the number of players increases.
Our experiments show that the percentage error in the Shapley value is at most 20.
Furthermore, in most cases, the error is less than 5%.
