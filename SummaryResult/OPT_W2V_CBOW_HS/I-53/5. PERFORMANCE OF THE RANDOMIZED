We vary m between 5 and 100 (since beyond 100 we found that the error is close to zero), for each m we vary q between 4μ and mμ (we impose these limits because they ensure that the size of the 964 The Sixth Intl.
We know that, for a sample of size X, the sum of the players" weights is distributed normally with mean Xμ and variance ν/X.
the constant k has no error, then the error in z is: e(z) = |k|e(x) Using the above rules, the error in the Shapley value (given in Equation 3) is obtained by propagating the error in Equation 4 to all coalitions between the sizes X = 1 and X = m. Let e(ϕi) denote this error where: e(ϕi) = 1 m mX X=1 e(ΔX i ) We analyze the performance of our method in terms of the  percentage error PE in the approximate Shapley value which is defined as follows: PE = 100 × e(ϕi)/ϕi (5) 5.2 Experimental Results We now compute the percentage error in the Shapley value using the above equation for PE.
Hence, the error in Equation 2 is either the probability that the sum lies between the limits a − e(σX ) and a (i.e., the area under the curve defined by N(Xμ, ν X ) between a − e(σX ) and a, which is the shaded region A in Figure 1) or the probability that the sum of weights lies between the limits b and b+e(σX ) (i.e., the area under the curve defined by N(Xμ, ν X ) between b and b + e(σX ), which is the shaded region C in Figure 1).
Since 99% of a normal distribution lies within two standard deviations of its mean [8], player i"s marginal contribution to a sample of size X is almost zero if: a < Xμ + 2 p ν/X or b > Xμ − 2 p ν/X This is because the three regions A, B, and C (in Figure 1) lie either to the right of Z2 or to the left of Z1.
For a given q, the Shapley value for player i is as given in Equation 3.
To this end, let e(σX ) be the sampling error in the sum of the weights for a sample of size X drawn from the distribution N(Xμ, ν X ) where: e(σX ) = p (ν/X)/ p (X) = p (ν)/X (4) Let e(ΔX i ) denote the error in the marginal contribution for player i (given in Equation 2).
If a measurement is repeated, the values obtained will differ and none of the results can be preferred over the others.
We now analyse the effect of the three parameters: w, q, and m on the percentage error in more detail.
Since the error in this sum is e(σX ), the actual values of a and b lie in the interval a ± e(σX ) and b ± e(σX ) respectively.
More specifically, the error is the maximum of these two probabilities: e(ΔX i ) = 1 p (2πν/X) × MAX „Z a a−e(σX ) e−X (x−Xμ)2 2ν dx, Z b+e(σX ) b e−X (x−Xμ)2 2ν dx « On the basis of the above error, we find the error in the Shapley value by using the following standard error propagation rules [22]: R1 If x and y are two random variables with errors e(x) and e(y) respectively, then the error in the random variable z = x + y is given by: e(z) = e(x) + e(y) R2 If x is a random variable with error e(x) and z = kx where 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 5 10 15 20 25 QuotaWeight PercentageerrorintheShapleyvalue Figure 3: Performance of the randomized method for m = 50 players.
Since a = q −wi and b = q − , Equation 6 can also be written as: Xμ − 2 p ν/X < q − wi < q − < Xμ + 2 p ν/X The smallest X that satisfies the constraint in Equation 6 strictly increases with q.

This is because, for the normal distribution, μ = 10 ensures that for almost all the players the weight is positive, and ν = 1 is used most commonly in statistical experiments (ν can be higher or lower but PE is increasing in  νsee Equations 4 and 5).
For a player with weight w, the percentage error in a player"s  Shapley value depends on the following five parameters (see Equation 3): 1.
The sampling error (or standard error) is  defined as the standard deviation for a set of measurements divided by the square root of the number of measurements.
Note that each of the two functions that are integrated in Equation 5 are the same as the function that is integrated in Equation 2.
Thus, the result of any physical measurement has two essential components: 1. a numerical value giving the best estimate possible of the quantity measured, and 2. the degree of uncertainty associated with this estimated value.
The error in the marginal contribution is either the area of the shaded region A (between a − e(σX ) and a) in Figure 1, or the shaded area C (between b and b + e(σX )).
However, player i"s marginal contribution is greater than zero for those X for which the following constraint is satisfied: Xμ − 2 p ν/X < a < b < Xμ + 2 p ν/X For this constraint, the three regions A, B, and C lie  somewhere between Z1 and Z2.
This implies that as q  increases, the error in the marginal contribution (and  consequently the error in the Shapley value) decreases.
Since this error depends on the  parameters of the voting game, we evaluate it in a range of settings by systematically varying the parameters of the voting game.
As per Equation 5, it is the maximum of these two areas.
The  interval over which the first integration in Equation 5 is done is a − a + e(σX ) = e(σX ), and the interval over which the second one is done is b + e(σX ) − b = e(σX ).

Hence, if the result of a measurement is to have meaning it cannot consist of the measured value alone.
In Equation 2, a and b are the lower and upper limits for the sum of the players" weights for a The Sixth Intl.
Thus, the  interval is the same for both integrations and it is independent of wi.
METHOD We first derive the formula for measuring the error in the  approximate Shapley value and then conduct experiments for evaluating this error in a wide range of settings.
winning coalition is more than one and less than m - see Section 3 for details), and for each q, we vary w between 1 and q−1 (because a winning coalition must contain at least two players).
As X increases, the error in sum of weights in a sample (i.e., e(σX ) = p (ν)/X) decreases.

The variance in the player"s weights (ν).
For example, if the estimate of a quantity is x and the uncertainty is e(x) the quantity would lie in x ± e(x).
As described in Section 4, we make measurements on samples that are drawn randomly from a given population (P) of players.
- Effect of m. It is clear from Equation 4 that the error e(σX ) is highest for X = 1 and it decreases with X.
Thus, error has to do with uncertainty in measurements that nothing can be done about.
Now, there are statistical errors associated with sampling which are unavoidable and must be lived with.
5.1 Approximation error The accuracy of the above randomized method depends on its  sampling error which is defined as follows [22, 4]: DEFINITION 2.
Also, the interval over which the integration for the marginal contribution of Equation 2 is done is b − a = wi − (see Figure 1).
For sampling experiments, the standard error is by far the most common way of characterising uncertainty [22].
Hence, as wi increases, the error in the marginal contribution decreases and PE also decreases.
- Effect of w. The PE depends on e(σX ) because, in  Equation 5, the limits of integration depend on e(σX ).
Given this, the following section defines this error and uses it to evaluate the  performance of the proposed randomized method.
Obviously, it cannot be determined exactly how far off a measurement is from the accepted value; if this could be done, it would be possible to just give a more accurate, corrected value.
Consequently, the error in a player"s marginal contribution (see Equation 5) also decreases.
But as m  increases, the effect of e(σ1 ) on PE decreases and, as a result, PE decreases. 
As seen in the figures, the maximum PE is around 20% and in most cases it is below 5%.
The concept of error relates to a measurement made of a  quantity which has an accepted value [22, 4].
This error is obtained by propagating the error in Equation 4 to Equation 2.
Since e(σX ) is independent of wi, as wi increases, e(σX ) remains unchanged.
We then vary m, q, and w as follows.
However, although it is not possible to do anything about such error, it can be characterized.
An indication of how accurate the result is must be included also.
The given player"s weight (w).
The results of these experiments are shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4.
However, before doing so, we introduce the idea of error.

In particular, we conduct experiments in the following setting.

We fix μ = 10 and ν = 1.
Only the limits of the integration are different.

Hence, for small m, e(σ1 ) has a significant effect on PE.
