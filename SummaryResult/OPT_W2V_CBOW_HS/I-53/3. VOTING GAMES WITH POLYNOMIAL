It is possible for the marginal contribution of this player to be one if it joins a coalition in which the number of type 1 players is between zero and (q − 1)/w1.
Let ϕl denote the Shapley value for the large player and ϕs that for each small player.
In the same way, we obtain the Shapley value of the large party for the general case where ws > 1 as: ϕl = wl/ws /(m + 1) Now consider a small player.
Thus, out of the total (m + 1) possible cases, its marginal contribution is one in wl cases.
However, the marginal contribution of the large party is one if it joins a coalition as the ith member where (q − wl) ≤ i < q.
Hence, the Shapley value of the large party is: ϕl = wl/(m + 1).
We  characterise such games in terms of the number of players and their weights.
In the same way, the Shapley value for a voting game with a single large party and multiple small parties can be determined in constant time.
For a voting game with more than three player types, the time complexity of the above method is a  polynomial of degree four or more.
Let C3 l (i, q) denote the number of all such coalitions that give a marginal contribution of one to the type 1 player where: C3 1 (i, q) = q−1 w1X i=0 q−iw1−1 w2X j=0 C2 1 (j, q − iw1) Therefore the Shapley value of the type 1 player is: ϕ1 = q−1 w1X i=0 C3 1 (i, q)/FACTORIAL(m1 + m2 + m3) The time complexity of finding this value is O(T q2 /w1w2) where: T = ( 3Y i=1 mi)(q − iwl − 1)( 3X i=1 mi)/(w2 + w3) Likewise, for the other two player types (2 and 3).
The set of parties consists of m1 players of type 1 (each with weight w1), m2 players of type 2 (each with weight w2), and m3 players of type 3 (each with weight w3).
We show the  computational tractability for this game by considering the following four possible scenarios: S1 q ≤ mlwl and q ≤ msws S2 q ≤ mlwl and q ≥ msws S3 q ≥ mlwl and q ≥ msws S4 q ≥ mlwl and q ≤ msws For the first scenario, consider a large player.
For i = 1, we get: C2 l (1, q) = C(ml, 1) × C „ ms, q − wl − 1 ws « × FACTORIAL „ q − wl − 1 ws « × FACTORIAL „ ml + ms − q − wl − 1 ws − 1 « In general, for i > 1, we get: C2 l (i, q) = C(ml, i) × C „ ms, q − iwl − 1 ws « × FACTORIAL „ q − iwl − 1 ws « × FACTORIAL „ ml + ms − q − wl − 1 ws − 1 « Thus the large player"s Shapley value is: ϕl = q−1 wlX i=0 C2 l (i, q)/FACTORIAL(ml + ms) For a given i, the time to find C2 l (i, q) is O(T) where T = (mlms(q − iwl − 1)(ml + ms))/ws Hence, the time to find the Shapley value is O(T q/wl).
To begin, consider the case i = 0: C2 l (0, q) = C „ ms, q − 1 ws « × FACTORIAL „ q − 1 ws « × FACTORIAL „ ml + ms − q − 1 ws − 1 « where C(y, x) denotes the number of possible combinations of x items from a set of y items.
It is possible for the marginal contribution of this player to be one if it joins a coalition in which the number of large players is between zero and (q −1)/wl.
On the other hand, if q = mj (m = |N| is the number of players), only the grand coalition is possible.
The smallest  possible value for q is wl + 1.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 961 Consider a coalition such that when the large player joins in, there are i large players and (q − iwl − 1)/ws small players  already in it, and the remaining players join after the large player.
3.2 A single large party Consider a game in which there are two types of players: large (with weight wl > ws) and small (with weight ws).
Furthermore, the weight of the large party cannot be greater than q, since in that case, there would be no need for the large party to form a coalition.
If q ≤ j, then there would be no need for the players to form a coalition.
Also, since the small  parties have equal weights, their Shapley values are the same.
TIME SOLUTIONS Here we describe those voting games for which the Shapley value can be determined in polynomial time.
In order to determine the Shapley value for this player, we need to consider the number of all possible coalitions that give it a marginal contribution of one.
For these games, the value of a coalition is one if the weight of the coalition is greater than or equal to q, otherwise it is zero.
We know that the sum of the  Shapley values of all the m+1 players is one.
This player can join a coalition as the ith member where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. However, the marginal contribution of the player is 1 only if it joins a coalition as the q/j th member.
The weight of each large party is wl and that of each small one is ws, where ws < wl.
The lower limit is 2 because the weight of the large party has to be greater than each small one.
Hence, we get: ϕs = 1 − ϕl m Thus, both ϕl and ϕs can be computed in constant time.
3.3 Multiple large and small parties We now consider a voting game that has two player types: large and small (as in Section 3.2), but now there are multiple large and multiple small parties.
This is because, if q ≤ wl, then the large party can win the election on its own without the need for a coalition.
3.1 All players have equal weight Consider the game q; j, .
The value of a coalition is one if the weight of the coalition is greater than or equal to q, otherwise it is zero.
In the same way, a small player"s Shapley value is: ϕs = q−1 wsX i=0 C2 s (i, q)/FACTORIAL(ml + ms) and can be found in time O(T q/ws).
The quota for this game is q; i.e., we have a game of the form q; wl, ws, ws, .
However, the computational  complexity of the above direct enumeration method increases with the number of player types.
Consider a coalition such that when the type 1 player joins in, there are i type 1 players already in it.
The total number of players is (m + 1).
Let C2 l (i, q) denote the number of all such coalitions.
Recall that for our voting game, a player"s marginal contribution to a coalition can only be zero or one.
There is one large player and m small ones.
To deal with such situations, therefore, the following section presents a faster randomised method for  finding the approximate Shapley value. 
This party can join a coalition as the ith member where 1 ≤ i ≤ (m + 1).
Likewise, the remaining three scenarios (S2 to S4) can be shown to have the same time  complexity.
In all the remaining cases, its marginal contribution is zero.
Thus, the quota for the game satisfies the constraint wl + 1 ≤ q ≤ m + wl − 1.
This is achieved using the direct enumeration approach (i.e., listing all possible coalitions and finding a player"s marginal contribution to each of them).
Thus, we have identified games for which the exact Shapley value can be easily determined.
For this voting game, consider a player of type 1.
The interesting games are those for which the quota (q) satisfies the constraint: (j + 1) ≤ q ≤ j(m − 1).
In other words, there are (q − 1)/w1 + 1 such cases and we now consider each of them.
Such a coalition gives the large player unit marginal contribution.
This is because both require a constant number of basic operations  (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
The remaining players join after the type 1 player.
Also, the lower and upper limits for wl are 2 and (q − 1) respectively.
Consider any one player.
In all other cases, its marginal contribution is zero.
Since ϕ requires one division operation, it can be found in constant time (i.e., O(1)).
Thus, the Shapley value for each player ϕ = 1/m.
Let ϕ denote the Shapley value for a player.
3.4 Three player types We now consider a voting game that has three player types: 1, 2, and 3.
Each party has j votes.
In other words, there are (q −1)/wl +1 such cases and we now consider each of them.
The set of parties consists of ml large  parties and ms small parties.
