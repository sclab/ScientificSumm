This is a complementary  aspect to the techniques described in this paper, since if we have the Web pages tagged with location information, a search engine can conveniently return pages with a geographical scope related to the scope of the query.
The ability to recognize and reason about the geographical terminology, given in the text documents and user queries, is a crucial aspect of these geographical  information retrieval (GIR) systems [4, 7].
In the case of queries not containing explicit place references, we use geographical scopes previously assigned to the documents, whereas Wang et.
However, if each concept at the ontology contains associated coordinate  information, the approach described here could also be used to build a geocoding service.
Again, these previously proposed methods are difficult to apply to the geographic domain.
The former has another twist, since the same name can be used for locations as well as for other class of  entities, such as persons or company names (referent class ambiguity).
In comparison, we propose simpler techniques based on matching names from a geographic ontology.
Search engine performance depends on the ability to capture the most likely meaning of a query as intended by the user [16].
Ambiguity in geographical references is bi-directional [15].
The problem addressed in this paper is also slightly different, since we are trying not only to detect local queries but also to disambiguate the local of interest.
A recent enhancement to search engine technology is the addition of geographic  reasoning, combining geographic information systems and information retrieval in order to build search engines that find information  associated with given locations.
Our approach looks for spatial relationships at the query string, and it also associates the place  references to ontology concepts.
proposed to go further than detecting local queries, by also disambiguating the implicit local of interest [17].
NER has been successfully automated with near-human performance, but the specific problem of recognizing geographical references presents additional challenges [9].
Google Local, for instance, initially required the user to specify a location qualifier separately from the search query.
The same name can be used for more than one location (referent ambiguity), and the same location can have more than one name (reference ambiguity).
Moreover, Google Local does not take spatial  relations into account.
In sum, there are already some studies on tagging geographical references, but Web queries pose additional challenges which have not been addressed.
Taking a string with an address, a geocoder queries a geographical  information system and returns interpolated coordinate values for the given location.
studied the classification of Web queries into two types, namely local and global [5].
Besides the recognition of geographical expressions, GIR also  requires that the recognized expressions be classified and grounded to unique identifiers [11].
They defined a query as local if its best matches on a Web search engine are likely to be local pages, such as houses for sale.
The  proposed approach works for both queries containing place references and queries not containing them, by looking for dominant  geographic references over query logs and text from search results.
However, most of these works did not consider place  references or geographical categories.
Text mining techniques that make use of context information are  difficult to apply for high accuracy.
associating them to coordinates or concepts at an ontology) assures that they can be used in more advanced GIR tasks.
Previous works have addressed the tagging and grounding of locations in Web pages, as well as the assignment of geographic scopes to these documents [1, 7, 13].
When handling named  entities with a high level of detail, ambiguity problems arise more  frequently.
Previous studies showed that a significant portion of the queries  submitted to search engines are geographic [8, 14].
Extracting and distinguishing different types of entities in text is usually referred to as Named Entity Recognition (NER).
The task of handling geographical references over documents is however considerably different from that of  handling geographical references over queries.
More recently, it added location look-up  capabilities that extract locations from query strings.
There are nowadays many geocoding, reverse-geocoding, and mapping services on the Web that can be easily integrated with other applications.
Instead of computing coordinates for a given place reference, the technique described in this paper aims at assigning references to the corresponding ontology concepts.
proposed to  extract locations from the text of the top search results.
However, the intrinsics of their solution are not published, and their approach also does not handle  locationimplicit queries.
A number of commercial search services have also started to  support location-based searches.
Grounding the recognized expressions (e.g.
In our case, queries are usually short and often do not constitute proper sentences.
Geocoding is the process of locating points on the surface of the Earth from alphanumeric addressing data.
Previous studies have also addressed the use of text mining and automated classification techniques over search engine queries [16, 10].
Most of such existing services are commercial in nature, and there are no technical publications describing them.
A number of classification algorithms have been evaluated using search engine queries.
For at least a decade, this has been an important text mining task, and a key  feature of the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) [3].
For example, in a search for Pizza Seattle, Google Local returns local results for pizza near Seattle, WA.
In this paper, we explain the proposed  solutions for the identified problems.

However, their experimental results showed that only a rather low precision and recall could be achieved.
