In queries where a geographical reference is not explicitly mentioned, we  propose to use the results for the query, exploiting geographic scopes previously assigned to these documents.
The proposed techniques for handling geographic queries can have many applications in improving GIR systems or even general purpose search engines.
However, our initial experiments indicate that for many queries, the referenced places can be determined effectively.
After place references are appropriately disambiguated into ontology concepts, a GIR system can use them to retrieve relevant results, through the use of appropriate index structures (e.g.
In a general purpose search engine, and if a local query is detected, we can forward users to a GIR system, which should be better suited for properly handling the query.
This paper presented simple approaches for handling place  references in search engine queries.
A different GIR strategy can involve query expansion, by taking the where terms from the query and using the ontology to add names from  neighboring locations.
In the future, we plan on doing a careful evaluation of this last approach.
The regular Google search interface already does this, by presenting a link to Google Local when it detects a geographical query. 
Another idea that we would like to test involves the integration of a spelling  correction mechanism [12] into Algorithm 1, so that incorrectly spelled place references can be matched to ontology concepts.
Unlike the  techniques proposed by Wang et.
The proposed techniques were employed in the prototype system that we used for participating in GeoCLEF 2006.
This is a hard text mining problem, as queries are often ambiguous or underspecify information needs.
indexing the spatial coordinates associated with  ontology concepts) and provided that the documents are also assigned to scopes corresponding to ontology concepts.
[17], we mainly focused on  recognizing spatial relations and associating place names to ontology concepts.
