An abductive program is a pair P, H where P is an EDP and H is a set of literals called abducibles.
A set S of ground literals satisfies the  conjunction G if { L1θ, .
Given a conjunction G of (NAF-)literals, Gθ denotes the conjunction obtained by applying θ to G. A program, rule, or literal is ground if it contains no variable.
E and F are sets of ground literals such that E ⊆ H\P and F ⊆ H ∩ P. When (P \ F) ∪ E has an answer set S satisfying the above three conditions, S is called a belief set of an abductive  program P, H satisfying G (with respect to (E, F)).
Given an NAF-free EDP P, Cn(P) denotes the smallest set of ground literals which is (i) closed under P, i.e., for  every ground rule r in Ground(P), body(r) ⊆ Cn(P) implies head(r) ∩ Cn(P) = ∅; and (ii) logically closed, i.e., it is  either consistent or equal to Lit.
Then, the reduct P S is the  program which contains the ground rule head(r) ← body+ (r) iff there is a rule r in Ground(P) such that body− (r)∩S = ∅.
Note that if P has a consistent answer set S satisfying G, S is also a belief set of P, H satisfying G with respect to (E, F) = (∅, ∅).
Throughout the paper, abductive programs are  assumed to be consistent unless stated otherwise.
Also, not body− (r) denotes the set of NAF-literals {not Lm+1, .
A rule r is often written as head(r) ← body+ (r), not body− (r) or head(r) ← body(r) where body(r) = body+ (r)∪not body− (r).
An  explanation (E, F) of an observation G is called minimal if for any explanation (E , F ) of G, E ⊆ E and F ⊆ F imply E = E and F = F. Example 2.1.
Consider the abductive program P, H : P : flies(x) ← bird(x), not ab(x) , ab(x) ← broken-wing(x) , bird(tweety) ← , bird(opus) ← , broken-wing(tweety) ← .
A program P with variables is a shorthand of its ground instantiation Ground(P), the set of ground rules obtained from P by substituting variables in P by elements of its Herbrand universe in every possible way.
When a literal L ∈ H contains variables, any instance of L is also an abducible.
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a conjunction as above.
For each rule r of the above form, head(r), body+ (r) and body− (r) denote the sets of literals {L1, .
A substitution is a  mapping from variables to terms θ = {x1/t1, .
Note that normal abduction (as in [9]) considers only  introducing hypotheses to explain an observation.
Given an EDP P and a set S of literals, S is an answer set of P if S = Cn(P S ).
An abductive program P, H is consistent if P is  consistent.
A rule r is an integrity constraint if head(r) = ∅; and r is a fact if body(r) = ∅.
, Lnθ }∩ S = ∅ for some ground instance Gθ with a substitution θ.
A program P is consistent if it has a consistent answer set; otherwise, P is inconsistent.
Suppose a program P and a set of literals S(⊆ Lit).
Extended abduction introduces/removes hypotheses to/from a program to explain an observation.
A program is NAF-free if no rule contains NAF-literals.
Let Lit be the set of all ground literals in the language of a program.
An EDP (or simply a program) is a set of rules of the form: L1 ; · · · ; Ll ← Ll+1 , .
, not Ln be a conjunction, where all variables in G are existentially quantified at the front and range-restricted, i.e., every variable in Lm+1, .
(P \ F) ∪ E is consistent, 3.
(P \ F) ∪ E has an answer set which satisfies G, 2.
A  disjunction of literals and a conjunction of (NAF-)literals in a rule are identified with its corresponding sets of literals.
Abductive logic programming [9] introduces a mechanism of hypothetical reasoning to logic programming.
The semantics of an EDP is defined by the answer set semantics [7].
A pair (E, F) is an explanation of an observation G in P, H if1 1.
, not Ln (n ≥ m ≥ l ≥ 0) where each Li is a positive/negative  literal, i.e., A or ¬A for an atom A, and not is negation as failure (NAF).
not L is called an NAF-literal.
Logic programs considered in this paper are extended  disjunctive programs (EDP) [7].
A rule r is disjunctive if head(r) contains more than one  literal.
An answer set is consistent if it is not Lit.
An  abductive framework used in this paper is the extended  abduction introduced by Inoue and Sakama [8, 15].
, xn are distinct variables and each ti is a term  distinct from xi.
The observation G = flies(tweety) has the minimal  explanation (E, F) = (∅, {broken-wing(tweety)}).
A program has none, one, or multiple answer sets in general.
Two rules/literals are identified with respect to variable renaming.
