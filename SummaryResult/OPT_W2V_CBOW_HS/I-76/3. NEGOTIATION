When a proposal G is made by Ag1, P1, H1 has a belief set satisfying G. If the agent Ag2 accepts the proposal G, it is satisfied by an answer set of P2 which is also a belief set of P2, H2 .
Let P1, H1 be an abductive program of an agent Ag1 and Gi 2 a proposal made by Ag2 at the i-th round.
Given a  proposal G1 1 which is satisfied by an answer set of P1, a  negotiation starts.
As G1 s is stored in FP 2 s and no other  conditional proposal satisfying the buyer"s requirement exists, the seller produces neighborhood proposals.
Let Pk, Hk be an abductive program of an agent Agk and Gj a proposal, which is not a critique, made by any agent at the j(≤ i)-th round.
3.1 Conditional Proposals by Abduction We suppose an agent who has a knowledge base  represented by an abductive program P, H .
Let G be a proposal obtained by anti-instantiation.
In this case, S satisfies Gθ, E, not F. A conditional proposal G provides a minimal requirement for accepting the proposal G. If Gθ has multiple minimal  explanations, several conditional proposals exist accordingly.
If P has an answer set S which satisfies G θ for some substitution θ, G θ is called a neighborhood proposal by goal replacement.
Construction of Si x (x ∈ {c, n, cn}) in NSi 2 is incrementally done by adding new counter-proposals produced by Gi 1 or Gi−1 2 to Si−1 x .
In contrast, abducibles H are used for representing permissible conditions to make a compromise in the process of negotiation.
That is, Si n is constructed from Si−1 n by adding new proposals which are obtained by modifying the proposal Gi 1 made by Ag1 at the i-th round or modifying the proposal Gi−1 2 made by Ag2 at the (i − 1)-th round.
As Pb \ { dvd-rw } has a consistent answer set satisfying the above proposal, the buyer proposes the conditional  neighborhood proposal G4 b : pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), cd-rw, not dvd-rw, price(x), x ≤ 1200 to the seller agent.
A negotiation set of Agk (at the i-th round) is a triple NSi k = (Si c, Si n, Si cn), where Si c is the set of conditional proposals, Si n is the set of neighborhood proposals, and Si cn is the set of conditional neighborhood proposals, produced by Gj and Pk, Hk .
The buyer then returns the  critique G2 b = reject to the seller, together with the critique set CS2 b (Pb, G1 s) = {(15)}.
As a result, the seller finds the minimal explanation (E, F) = ({ pay cash }, { add point }) which explains G1 b θ1 with θ1 = { x/1170 }.
(a) If Gi 1 violates an integrity constraint in P2, return the critique Gi 2 = reject to Ag1, together with the critique set CSi 2(P2, Gi 1).
In the step 4(b), Ag2 constructs a new proposal.
If μ(Si cn) = ∅, select one from μ(Si cn) and propose it as Gi 2 to Ag1; otherwise, negotiation ends in failure.
Dropping conditions: Construct G such that G ⊂ G. Goal replacement: If G is a conjunction G1, G2, where G1 and G2 are conjunctions, and there is a rule L ← G1 in P such that G1θ = G1 for some substitution θ, then build G as Lθ, G2.
If (E, F) is a minimal explanation of Gθ for some substitution θ in P, H , the conjunction G : Gθ, E, not F is called a conditional proposal (for G), where E, not F represents the conjunction: A1, .
For instance, Si n in NSi 2 is computed as Si n = Si−1 n ∪{ p | p is a neighborhood proposal made by Gi 1 } ∪ { p | p is a neighborhood proposal made by Gi−1 2 }, where S0 n = ∅.
The seller then considers another proposal by replacing b1 with a variable w, G1 b now becomes pc(w, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, price(x), x ≤ 1200.
For a replaced literal L ∈ G and a rule H ← B in P such that L = Hσ and (G \ {L}) ∪ Bσ = G for some substitution σ, put G = (G \ {L}) ∪ Bσ.
A critique set of Ag1 (at the i-th round) is a set CSi 1(P1, Gj 2) = CSi−1 1 (P1, Gj−1 2 ) ∪ { r | r is an integrity constraint in P1 and Gj 2 violates r } where j = i − 1 or i, and CS0 1 (P1, G0 2) = CS1 1 (P1, G0 2) = ∅.
A proposal L1, ..., Lm, not Lm+1, ..., not Ln violates an integrity constraint ← body+ (r), not body− (r) if for any substitution θ, there is a substitution σ such that body+ (r)σ ⊆ { L1θ, .
The atom pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G) represents that the seller agent has a PC of the brand b1 such that CPU is 1GHz, memory is 512MB, and HDD is 80GB.
This service would be  withdrawn in case of discount prices, so add point is specified as an abducible.
As G2θ2 = assist(compt dept), salary(40, 000) with θ2 = { x/40, 000 } is satisfied by an answer set of P, G2θ2 becomes a neighborhood proposal by  dropping conditions.
Example 3.1) Given the proposal G = assist(compt dept), salary(x), x ≥ 50, 000, • G1 = assist(w), salary(x), x ≥ 50, 000 is produced by substituting compt dept with a variable w. As G1θ1 = assist(math dept), salary(50, 000) with θ1 = { w/math dept } is satisfied by an answer set of P, G1θ1 becomes a neighborhood proposal by anti-instantiation.
A seller agent has the abductive program Ps, Hs in which Ps consists of belief Bs and desire Ds: Bs : pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G) ; pc(b2, 1G, 512M, 80G) ←,(1) dvd-rw ; cd-rw ←, (2) Ds : normal price(1300) ← pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, (3) normal price(1200) ← pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), cd-rw, (4) normal price(1200) ← pc(b2, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, (5) price(x) ← normal price(x), add point, (6) price(x ∗ 0.9) ← normal price(x), pay cash, not add point,(7) add point ←, (8) Hs : add point, pay cash.
A buyer agent has the abductive program Pb, Hb in which Pb consists of belief Bb and desire Db: Bb : drive ← dvd-rw, (9) drive ← cd-rw, (10) price(x) ←, (11) Db : pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G) ←, (12) dvd-rw ←, (13) cd-rw ← not dvd-rw, (14) ← pay cash, (15) ← price(x), x > 1200, (16) Hb : dvd-rw.
The agent makes his/her request as the proposal:2 G = assist(compt dept), salary(x), x ≥ 50, 000.
employee(x) ← assist(x), employee(x) ← system admin(x), assist(compt dept); assist(math dept) ; system admin(compt dept) ←, H : has PhD, where available positions are represented by disjunction.
• G3 = employee(compt dept), salary(x), x ≥ 50, 000 is produced by replacing assist(compt dept) with employee(compt dept) using the rule employee(x) ← assist(x) in P. By G3 and the rule employee(x) ← system admin(x) in P, G3 = sys admin(compt dept), salary(x), x ≥ 50, 000 is produced.
The university has the abductive program P, H : P : salary(40, 000) ← assist(compt dept), not has PhD, salary(60, 000) ← assist(compt dept), has PhD, salary(50, 000) ← assist(math dept), salary(55, 000) ← system admin(compt dept), 2 For notational convenience, we often include mathematical (in)equations in proposals/programs.
A proposal G is accepted in an  abductive program P, H if P has an answer set satisfying G. When a proposal is not accepted, abduction is used for seeking conditions to make it acceptable.
When (E, F) = (∅, ∅), a conditional proposal is used as a new proposal made in response to the proposal G. Example 3.1.
As Ps has no answer set which satisfies G1 b , the seller agent cannot accept the proposal.
If P has an answer set S which satisfies G θ for some substitution θ, G θ is called a neighborhood proposal by dropping conditions.
In its construction, Ag2 should take care of the critique set CSi 1(P1, Gi−1 2 ), which  represents integrity constraints, if any, accumulated in previous rounds, that Ag1 must satisfy.
This strategy seeks conditions which satisfy the given proposal, prior to neighborhood  proposals which change the original one.
Let G be a proposal obtained by either anti-instantiation or dropping conditions.
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a proposal.
The buyer again  returns the critique G3 b = reject to the seller, together with the critique set CS3 b (Pb, G2 s) = CS2 b (Pb, G1 s) ∪ {(16)}.
As Ps has an answer set which satisfies G3 s : pc(b2, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, price(1200), the seller offers G3 s as a new counter-proposal.
If a negotiation terminates with agreement on a  proposal G, both P1, H1 and P2, H2 have belief sets satisfying G. Proof.
A DVD-RW is specified as an abducible which is subject to concession.
The buyer relaxes G1 b by goal replacement using the rule (9) in Pb, and produces pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), drive, price(x), x ≤ 1200.
Else if P2 has an answer set satisfying Gi 1, Ag2 returns Gi 2 = accept to Ag1.
The above protocol  produces the candidate proposals in Si x for each x ∈ {c, n, cn} at once.
If μ(Si c) = ∅, select one from μ(Si c) and propose it as Gi 2 to Ag1; otherwise, go to (ii).
As G3 θ3 = sys admin(compt dept), salary(55, 000) with θ3 = { x/55, 000 } is satisfied by an answer set of P, G3 θ3 becomes a neighborhood proposal by goal replacement.
When G = Gθ, E, not F, (P \ F) ∪ E has a consistent answer set S satisfying Gθ and E ∩ F = ∅.
An agent Agk accumulates proposals that are made by Agk but are rejected by another agent, in the failed proposal set FP i k (at the i-th round), where FP 0 k = ∅.
A normal price is a selling price on the condition that service points are added (6).
Let G be a proposal obtained by goal replacement.
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a proposal.
(b) Otherwise, construct NSi 2 as follows.
3.2 Neighborhood Proposals by Relaxation When a proposal is unacceptable, an agent tries to  construct a new counter-proposal by weakening constraints in the initial proposal.
The seller takes an action of making a counter-proposal and performs abduction.
If P has an answer set S which satisfies G θ for some  substitution θ and G θ = G, G θ is called a neighborhood proposal by anti-instantiation.
When an abductive program is function-free, abducibles and negotiation sets are both finite.
In particular, G is called a  critique if G = accept or G = reject where accept and reject are the reserved propositions.
As Ps has an answer set which satisfies G2 s : pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, price(1300), 1026 The Sixth Intl.
Suppose G as in Definition 3.5(3).
Let Ag1 and Ag2 be two agents having  abductive programs P1, H1 and P2, H2 , respectively.
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a proposal.
(1st round) First, the following proposal is given by the buyer agent: G1 b : pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, price(x), x ≤ 1200.
Let G be a proposal obtained by goal replacement.
• G2 = assist(compt dept), salary(x) is produced by dropping the salary condition x ≥ 50, 000.
Si x (x ∈ {c, n, cn}) accumulates proposals produced by Gj (1 ≤ j ≤ i) according to Definitions 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6.
Note that an agent can construct counter-proposals by modifying its own previous proposals or another agent"s proposals.
(ii) Produce Si n. If μ(Si n) = ∅, select one from μ(Si n) and propose it as Gi 2 to Ag1; otherwise, go to (iii).
Finally, extended abduction and relaxation are combined to produce conditional neighborhood proposals.
Then, G is relaxed to G in the following three ways: Anti-instantiation: Construct G such that G θ = G for some substitution θ.
A negotiation set represents the space of possible proposals made by an agent.
Else if Gi 1 = reject, put FP i 2 = FPi−1 2 ∪{Gi−1 2 } where {G0 2} = ∅.
A critique set of an agent Ag1 accumulates integrity  constraints which are violated by proposals made by another agent Ag2.
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a proposal.
Rules (12) - (16) are the buyer"s desire.
(4th round) The buyer does not accept G3 s because a PC of the brand b2 is out of his/her interest and Pb has no answer set satisfying G3 s. Then, the buyer makes a concession by changing his/her original goal.
Suppose two agents Ag1 and Ag2 who have abductive  programs P1, H1 and P2, H2 , respectively.
Let G be a proposal obtained by dropping conditions.
In the step 4(a), Ag2 rejects the proposal Gi 1 and returns the reason of rejection as a critique set.
The seller constructs the conditional proposal: G1 s : pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, price(1170), pay cash, not add point and offers it to the buyer.
Each i-th round (i ≥ 1) consists of a proposal Gi 1 made by one agent Ag1 and another proposal Gi 2 made by the other agent Ag2.
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a proposal.
Proceed to the step 4(b).
In this case, (E, F) = ({has PhD}, ∅)  becomes the minimal explanation of Gθ = assist(compt dept), salary(60, 000) with θ = { x/60, 000 }.
He/she relaxes G1 b by dropping x ≤ 1200 in the condition, and produces pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), dvd-rw, price(x).
In the above protocol, an agent produces Si c at first,  secondly Si n, and finally Si cn.
If (E, F) is a minimal explanation of G θ for some substitution θ, the conjunction G θ, E, not F is called a conditional neighborhood proposal by goal replacement.
Since Ps also has an answer set satisfying G4 b , the seller accepts it and sends the message G4 s = accept to the buyer.
Each G obtained by these operations is called a relaxation of G. It is worth noting that these operations are also used in the context of  inductive generalization [12].
The above protocol is repeatedly applied to each one of the two negotiating agents until a negotiation ends in  success/failure.
This means that Ag2 can make no counter-proposal or every  counterproposal made by Ag2 is rejected by Ag1.
If P1, H1 and P2, H2 are function-free (i.e., both Pi and Hi contain no function symbol), any  negotiation will terminate.
If (E, F) is a minimal  explanation of G θ(= G) for some substitution θ, the  conjunction G θ, E, not F is called a conditional neighborhood proposal by anti-instantiation/dropping conditions.
An agent seeks a position of a research assistant at the computer department of a university with the condition that the salary is at least 50,000 USD per year.
Goal replacement replaces the condition G1 in G with a literal Lθ in the presence of a rule L ← G1 in P under the condition G1θ = G1.
Conditional neighborhood proposals are to be considered in the last place, since they differ from the original one to the maximal extent.
A conditional neighborhood proposal reduces to a  neighborhood proposal when (E, F) = (∅, ∅).
Moreover, if a proposal is once rejected, it is not proposed again by the function μ.
Using (10), the following proposal is produced: pc(b1, 1G, 512M, 80G), cd-rw, price(x), x ≤ 1200.
CSi 2(P2, Gj 1) is defined in the same manner.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) the seller offers G2 s as a new counter-proposal.
If G is a conditional proposal, there is a belief set S of P, H satisfying G .
(i) Produce Si c. Let μ(Si c) = { p | p ∈ Si c \ FPi 2 and p satisfies the constraints in CSi 1(P1, Gi−1 2 )}.
In response to this, the seller tries to make another proposal which satisfies the constraint in this critique set.
Integrity constraints are conditions which an agent should satisfy, so that they are used to explain why an agent does not accept a proposal.
Then, the  conditional proposal made by the university becomes assist(compt dept), salary(60, 000), has PhD .
Here, Lθ is called a replaced literal.
Another strategy, which prefers neighborhood proposals to conditional ones, is also considered.
Thus, the negotiation ends in success. 
According to P, the base salary of a research assistant at the computer department is 40,000 USD, but if he/she has PhD, it is 60,000 USD.
In response to the proposal Gi 1 made by Ag1 at the i-th round, Ag2 behaves as follows.
We suppose one-to-one negotiation between two agents who have a common  ontology and the same language for successful communication.
On the other hand, a discount price is applied if the paying method is cash and no service point is added (7).
We can consider a variant of the protocol in which each proposal in Si x is constructed one by one (see  Example 3.3).
They are written by literals, for instance, x ≥ y by geq(x, y) with a suitable definition of the predicate geq.
A program P consists of two types of knowledge, belief B and desire D, where B represents objective knowledge of an agent, while D represents subjective knowledge in general.
Si c and Si cn are obtained as well.
(2nd round) The buyer does not accept G1 s because he/she cannot pay it by cash (15).
A counter-proposal is a  proposal made in response to a proposal.
A negotiation proceeds in a series of rounds.
Among them, (15) and (16) impose constraints for buying a PC.
Here, (1) and (2) represent selection of products.
We define P = B ∪ D, but do not distinguish B and D if such  distinction is not important in the context.
This  allows the database to return neighborhood answers which are related to the original query.
If Gi 1 = accept, an agreement is reached and  negotiation ends in success.
This helps for Ag1 The Sixth Intl.
Prices of products are  represented as desire of the seller.
In each case, every variable in G is existentially quantified at the front and range-restricted.
The relaxed proposal can produce new offers which are neighbor to the original proposal.
Thus, negotiation will terminate in finite steps.
Suppose a buying-selling situation in the introduction.
We use the technique for producing proposals in the process of negotiation.
A proposal G is a conjunction of literals and NAF-literals: L1, .
When an original query fails in a database, relaxation expands the scope of the query by relaxing the constraints in the query.
Dropping conditions eliminates some conditions in a proposal.
Put FP i 2 = FPi−1 2 .
Formally, the above negotiation protocol has the following properties.
3.3 Negotiation Protocol A negotiation protocol defines how to exchange proposals in the process of negotiation.
Also, FP i 2 is used for  removing proposals which have been rejected.
All these operations  generalize proposals in different ways.
(3rd round) The buyer does not accept G2 s because he/she cannot pay more than 1200USD (16).
We use techniques of relaxation for this purpose.
Relaxation is used as a technique of  cooperative query answering in databases [4, 6].

Anti-instantiation replaces constants (or terms) with fresh variables.
