In the conceptual retrieval model presented in this paper, the similarity between a query and a document is measured on both concept and word levels.
We assume that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge might improve the effectiveness of retrieval.
We examine the effects of utilizing concepts and of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.
Keyword search in PubMed is effective if the query is well-crafted by the users using their expertise.
In this paper, concepts are entry terms of the ontology Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), a controlled vocabulary maintained by NLM for indexing biomedical literature, or gene symbols in the Entrez gene database also from NLM.
While NLM does maintain an experimental tool for free-text queries [6], it is still based on PubMed keyword search.
We approached the problem by utilizing domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual retrieval model.
Domain-specific knowledge, in this paper, refers to information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain.
For example, if one desires documents on the use of the drug propanolol in the disease hypertension, a typical PubMed query might be propanolol AND hypertension, which will return all the documents having the two keywords.
The techniques are introduced in section 3.
Intuitively, retrieval on the level of concepts should outperform bag-of-words approaches, since the semantic relationships among words in a concept are utilized.
For example, given a query What is the role of gene PRNP in the Mad Cow Disease?, expanding the gene symbol PRNP with its synonyms Prp, PrPSc, and prion protein, more relevant documents might be retrieved.
We propose a conceptual approach to utilize domain-specific knowledge in an IR system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature.
For most biologists, PubMed, an online service of U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), is the most commonly used tool for searching the biomedical literature.
The queries were collected from real biologists and they are expressed as complex questions, such as How do mutations in the Huntingtin gene affect Huntington"s disease?.
Systems from participating groups are expected to find relevant passages within the full-text documents.
PubMed and many other biomedical systems [8][9][10][13] also make use of domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval effectiveness.
A concept could be a word, such as the gene symbol PRNP, or a phrase, such as Mad cow diseases.
However, information needs of biologists, in some cases, are expressed as complex questions [8][9], which PubMed is not designed to handle.
Based on this approach, our system achieved significant improvement (23%) over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the Genomics track of TREC 2006.
Biologists search for literature on a daily basis.
The document collection contains 162,259 Highwire full-text documents in HTML format.
The Genomics track of the 2006 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) provides a common platform to assess the methods and techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information retrieval.
This paper is organized as follows: problem statement is given in the next section.
In some recent studies [13][15], positive results have been reported for this hypothesis.
A passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the HTML paragraph tag (i.e., <P> or </P>).
Related works are given in section 5 and finally, we conclude the paper in section 6. 
In section 4, we present the experimental results.
This paper makes two contributions: 1.
PubMed allows for keyword search by using Boolean operators.
