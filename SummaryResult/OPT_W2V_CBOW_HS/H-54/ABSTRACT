Based on the TREC platform, we show that appropriate use of  domainspecific knowledge in a proposed conceptual retrieval model yields about 23% improvement over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the Genomics Track of TREC 2006.
This paper presents a study of incorporating domain-specific knowledge (i.e., information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain) in an information retrieval (IR) system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature.
