These methods are aimed at making large delays and message loss tolerable for players but does not consider the  problems that may be introduced by varying delays from the server to different players or from the players to one another.
Objects that are part of the game may move but how this information is communicated to the players seems to be beyond the scope of these works.
In Section 4, we describe the DR vector scheduling algorithm that aims to make the export error equal across the players with varying delays from the sender of a DR vector, followed by experimental results  obtained from instrumentation of the scheduling algorithm on the open source game BZFlag.
Based on these action messages, the state of the game is changed at the game server and these changes are communicated to the players using update messages.
Fairness is achieved by ordering the delivery of action and update messages at the game server and players respectively based on the notion of a fair-order which takes into account the delays between the game server and the different players.
In general, techniques based on bucket synchronization depend on imposing a worst case delay on all the players.
But these works [7, 8] assume the existence of a global view of the game where a game server maintains a view (or state) of the game.
In the next section, we describe the game model that we use and illustrate how senders and receivers exchange DR vectors and how entities are rendered at the receivers based on the time-stamp augmented DR vector exchange as described in [1].
In this sense, these works are very limited in scope and may be applicable only to  firstperson shooter games and that too to only games where players are not part of the game.
There have been a few papers which have studied the problem of fairness in a distributed game by more sophisticated message  delivery mechanisms.
For example, the concept of local lag has been used in [3] where each player delays every local operation for a certain amount of time so that  remote players can receive information about the local operation and execute the same operation at the about same time, thus reducing state inconsistencies.
It has been shown in [9] that multi-player games that use DR vectors together with bucket synchronization are not  cheatproof unless additional mechanisms are put in place.
Players can introduce objects into the game or delete objects that are already part of the game (for example, in a first-person shooter game, by shooting down the object).
For  example, a receiver could skew the delay estimate at the sender to make the sender believe that the delay between the sender and the receiver is high thereby gaining undue advantage.
The online multi-player game MiMaze [2, 5, 6], for example, takes a static bucket synchronization approach to compensate for variable network delays.
These additions and deletions are communicated to the game server  using action messages.
DR vectors can be exchanged directly among the players  (peerto-peer model) or using a central server as a relay (client-server model).
We emphasize that the focus of this paper is on fairness without addressing the issue of cheating.
Earlier work on network games to deal with network latency has mostly focussed on compensation techniques for packet delay and loss [2, 3, 4].
In MiMaze, each player delays all events by 100 ms regardless of whether they are  generated locally or remotely.
Both the scheduling algorithm and the budget-based algorithm described in our paper use DR vectors and hence are not cheat-proof.
Section 5, describes the budget based algorithm that achieves improved fairness but without reducing the level accuracy of game playing.
Players with a network delay larger than 100 ms simply cannot participate in the game.
Conclusions are presented in  Section 6.
