While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each user"s trades is not observable; this  depends on the details of the market process.
With real inputs and arbitrary prior  distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 
If the market structure is such that, for  example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each agent"s trade, then in equilibrium there is common  knowledge of all agents" expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.
This suggests that the problem of eliciting  truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of  computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].
Perhaps the most fragile  result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar dimension-based bound will hold for other families of  nonlinear clearing prices.
Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in any model in which the price is a known stochastically  monotone aggregate of agents" bids.
The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5 also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs, where each agent"s private information is a real number.
Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the same characterization for the set of computable Boolean functions.
However, all the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a known number of agents who know each bit of information.
Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market.
These markets have the property that a  riskneutral agent"s best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her current expected value of the security.
Theorem 3 and Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an agent"s strategy depends only on her conditional  expectation of the security"s value.
In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean functions of Boolean inputs.
Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.
Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the strategic problems in our current model.
Additionally, the number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and  publicly known.
In this section, we discuss the  applicability of these results to more general trading models.
Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches equilibrium.
Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least myopically incentive compatible.
One example is a  market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].
