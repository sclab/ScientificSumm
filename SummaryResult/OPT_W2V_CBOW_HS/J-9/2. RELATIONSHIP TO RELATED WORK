That is, the  dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be  aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.
For example, even though there is enough private information to determine completely the price of a security in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no information at all!
Still, it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a  consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities.
We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.
We are not asking whether all possible functions of private information can be evaluated, but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.
However, this theoretical ideal is almost never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a number of securities exponential in the number of random variables of interest.
In this  pa1 http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/ 2 When we refer to independence or dimensionality of  securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the random variables on which the security payoffs are based.
When available securities form an incomplete market [17] in relation to the desired information space-as is usually the case-aggregation may be partial.
As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented  evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to  aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety of market mechanisms.
So characterizations of when a rational expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not  immediately apply to our problem.
The authors mainly consider auctions of goods as their basic mechanistic unit and  examine the communication complexity involved in computing various functions of agents" valuations of goods.
A complete  market contains enough linearly independent securities to span the entire state space of interest [1, 31].
Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.
Not all private  information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not convey enough information to recover the complete joint probability distribution over all events.
Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally  computable function as a function of agents" valuations (types) that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow rational equilibrium strategies.
The theoretically ideal mechanism requires what is called a complete market.
per, we investigate cases in which even this partial  aggregation fails.
For  example, they give auction mechanisms that can compute the maximum, minimum, and kth-highest of the agents"  valuations of a single good using 1, 1, and n âˆ’ k + 1 bits of  communication, respectively.
They also examine the potential tradeoff between communication complexity and revenue.
