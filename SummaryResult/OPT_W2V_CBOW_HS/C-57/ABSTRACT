In addition, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such framework, where the failure probability of each resource depends on the number of agents selecting this resource.
In a CGLF, agents share a common set of resources, where each resource has a cost and a probability of failure.
It is the first model to  incorporate failures into congestion settings, which results in a strict generalization of congestion games.
We define a new class of games, congestion games with  loaddependent failures (CGLFs), which generalizes the well-known class of congestion games, by incorporating the issue of  resource failures into congestion games.
The utility of an agent is the  difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the resources he uses.
Each agent chooses a  subset of the resources for the execution of his task, in order to maximize his own utility.
Although, as we show, CGLFs do not admit a potential function, and in general do not have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, our main theorem proves the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in every CGLF with identical  resources and nondecreasing cost functions.
CGLFs possess two novel features.
