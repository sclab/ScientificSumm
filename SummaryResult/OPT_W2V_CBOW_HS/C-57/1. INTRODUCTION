Our work provides the first model of congestion settings with resource failures, which considers the sum of  congestiondependent costs over utilized resources, and therefore, does not extend the CGF-model, but rather generalizes the classic model of congestion games.
Monderer [8] dealt with another type of generalization of congestion games, in which the resource cost functions are player-specific (PS-congestion games).
In particular, if in our model the resource failure probabilities were constant and known in  advance, then a potential function would exist.
Monderer and Shapley [9]  introduced the notions of potential function and potential game and proved that the existence of a potential function implies the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
Thus, the congestion on the resources is not known in advance, but is strategy-dependent.
They observed that Rosenthal [11] proved his theorem on  congestion games by constructing a potential function (hence, every congestion game is a potential game).
In a congestion game, every agent has to choose from a finite set of resources, where the utility (or cost) of an agent from using a particular resource depends on the number of agents using it, and his total utility (cost) is the sum of the utilities (costs) obtained from the resources he uses.
In this model, we are given a finite set of identical resources (service providers) where each element possesses a failure  probability describing the probability of unsuccessful completion of its assigned tasks as a (nondecreasing) function of its  congestion.
He defined PS-congestion games of type q (q-congestion games), where q is a positive number, and showed that every game in strategic form is a q-congestion game for some q.  Playerspecific resource cost functions were discussed for the first time by Milchtaich [6].
In contrast with the CGF-model, in our model we consider the total cost of the utilized resources, where each agent wishes to maximize the difference between his benefit from a  successful task completion and the sum of his costs over the resources he uses.
Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [4]  proposed the worst-case ratio of the social welfare achieved by a Nash equilibrium and by a socially optimal strategy profile (dubbed the price of anarchy) as a measure of the performance degradation caused by lack of coordination.
In a local-effect game, each agent"s payoff is effected not only by the number of agents who have chosen the same resources as he has chosen, but also by the number of agents who have chosen neighboring resources (in a given graph structure).
The time required by each courier to deliver the package increases with the congestion on his way.
This study is motivated by a variety of situations in multi-agent systems with unreliable components, such as machines, computers etc.
PScongestion games were generalized to weighted congestion games [6] (or, ID-congestion games [7]), in which the  resource cost functions are not only player-specific, but also depend on the identity of the users of the resource.
Our results We show that CGLFs and, in particular, CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions, do not admit a  potential function.
We define a model for congestion games with load-dependent failures (CGLFs) which provides simple and natural description of such situations.
We show that these games do not admit a potential function.
They introduced a class of congestion games with failures (CGFs) and proved that these games, while not being  isomorphic to congestion games, always possess Nash equilibria in pure strategies.
Each resource is associated with a cost, which is a (nonnegative) function of the congestion  experienced by this resource.
The latter case  (decreasing cost functions) describes situations where a group of agents using a particular resource have an opportunity to share its cost among the group"s members, or, the cost of 210 using a resource decreases with the number of users,  according to some marketing policy.
Many of the proofs are omitted from this conference version of the paper, and will appear in the full version. 
Furthermore, the procedures proposed by the authors in [10] for the construction of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium are not valid in our model, even in the simple, agent-symmetric case, where all agents have the same benefit from successful completion of their tasks.
In addition, the payment to a courier is proportional to the time he spends in delivering the package.
We show that CGLFs and, in particular, CGLFs with decreasing cost functions, do not possess pure  strategy Nash equilibria.
In addition, in many real-life applications of our model the resource cost functions have a special structure.
Therefore, the CGLF model can not be reduced to congestion games.
The resource cost function describes the cost suffered by an agent for selecting that resource, as a function of the number of agents who have selected it.
Moreover, they showed that every finite potential game is isomorphic to a congestion game; hence, the classes of finite potential games and congestion games coincide.
In a CGF, the authors considered the delay associated with successful task completion, where the delay for an agent is the minimum of the delays of his successful attempts and the aim of each agent is to minimize his expected delay.
[1] showed that weighted congestion games admit pure strategy Nash equilibria if the strategy space of each player consists of the bases of a matroid on the set of resources.
However, as we show in our main result, there exists a pure strategy Nash  equilibrium in any CGLF with nondecreasing cost functions.
In particular, Leyton-Brown and Tennenholtz [5] extended the class of congestion games to the class of  localeffect games.
The former case is  motivated by situations where high congestion on a resource causes longer delay in its assigned tasks execution and as a result, the cost of utilizing this resource might be higher.
Nevertheless, if the  failure probabilities are constant (do not depend on the congestion) then a potential function is guaranteed to exist.
The objective of each agent is to maximize his own utility, which is the difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the set of resources he uses.
Since there is no guarantee that a courier will reach the destination in time, we might send several couriers to deliver the same package.
211 Organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Much of the work on congestion games has been inspired by the fact that every such game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
In the computer science context of  congestion games, where the alternatives of concern are machines, computers, communication lines etc., which are obviously prone to failures, this issue should not be ignored.
Moreover, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in the above context.
We study the effects of resource failures in congestion  settings.
Roughgarden and Tardos [12] used this  approach to study the cost of selfish routing in networks with a continuum of users.
In particular, they can monotonically increase or decrease with the number of the users, depending on the context.
An important property of these games is the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria.
There is a fixed number of agents, each having a task which can be carried out by any of the resources.
However, in our main result we show the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in nondecreasing CGLFs.
Section 4 is devoted to a short discussion.
The benefits of the agents from successful completion of their tasks are allowed to vary across the agents.
Intensive study has also been devoted to quantify the inefficiency of equilibria in congestion games.
The above differences imply that CGFs and CGLFs  possess different properties.
In 3.1 we show that CGLFs, in general, do not have pure strategy Nash equilibria.
This, however, does not hold for CGFs; in CGFs, the failure probabilities are constant but there is no potential function.
Penn, Polukarov and Tennenholtz were the first to  incorporate the issue of failures into congestion settings [10].
[3] studied the computational complexity of finding pure strategy Nash equilibria in congestion games.
In Section 2 we define our model.
However, the above settings do not take into  consideration the possibility that resources may fail to execute their assigned tasks.
Thus, it is natural to assume that these functions are nonnegative.
He showed that simple and  strategysymmetric PS-congestion games are not potential games, but always possess a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
For reliability reasons, each agent may decide to assign his task, simultaneously, to a number of resources.
Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [2] considered the price of anarchy of pure equilibria in congestion games with linear cost functions.
A typical example of such situation is as follows.
In Section 3 we present our results.
Congestion games have been extensively studied and  generalized.
Thus, the payment to the courier increases when the congestion increases.
Related work Our model extends the well-known class of congestion games [11].
In 3.2 we focus on CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions (nondecreasing CGLFs).
The CGF-model significantly differs from ours.
Assume we need to deliver an important package.
