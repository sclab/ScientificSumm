An analysis of the resultant behavior of  bidders must incorporate the possibility of a bidder winning an item and having it withdrawn in order for the bid-taker to formulate a repair solution after a break elsewhere.
However, in our case we are seeking to repair the solution with the given bids.
In the case where no robust solutions are found, it is possible to optimize robustness, instead of revenue, by finding a solution of at least a given revenue that minimizes the probability of an  irreparable break.
Equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal for sufficiently small probabilities of an award to the second  highest bidder in the event of a bid withdrawal; 2.
When the bid-taker has combinatorial  valuations for task completions it may be desirable to assign the same task to multiple agents to ensure solution robustness.
The impact of such a constraint on revenue of robust solutions is also left for future work.
If a winning bidder"s revised valuation for a set of items drops by more than the penalty for withdrawal of the bid, then it is in his best interests to forfeit the item(s) and pay the penalty.
In this manner the least brittle solution of adequate revenue may be chosen. 
Combinatorial auctions with mutual bid bonds add an extra incentive to bid aggressively because of the possibility of being compensated for having a winning bid withdrawn by a bid-taker.
Alternatively, it may be  possible to use a top-down approach by looking at the k-best solutions sequentially, in terms of revenue, and performing sensitivity  analysis upon each solution until a robust one is found.
Penalty payments for bid withdrawal also create an incentive for more aggressive bidding by providing a form of insurance against the winner"s curse [8].
This reduces the number of potential solutions and thereby reduces the reparability of each solution.
It is desirable to minimize such potentially redundant task assignments but not to the detriment of completed task valuations.
Harstad and Rothkopf have analyzed bidder aggressiveness [8] using a strictly game-theoretic model in which the only reason for bid withdrawal is the winner"s curse.
Harstad and Rothkopf [8] examined the conditions required to ensure an equilibrium position in which bidding was at least as aggressive as if no bid withdrawal was permitted, given this countervailing incentive to under-estimate a valuation.
Should the auction rules state that the bid-taker will refuse to sell the items to any of the remaining bidders in the event of a withdrawal, then insurance against potential losses will  stimulate more aggressive bidding.
This problem could be modeled using the WSS framework in a similar manner to that of combinatorial auctions.
This is militated against by the increased probability of not having items withdrawn in a repair solution.
introduced the notion of fault tolerant mechanism design in which agents have private  information regarding costs for task completion, but also their  probabilities of failure [20].
A side-effect of such a policy is to offset the increased aggressiveness by incentivizing  reduced valuations in expectation that another bidder"s successful bid is withdrawn.
A possible extension of our work in this paper may be to examine the feasibility of reformulating integer linear programs so that the  solutions are robust.
Equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the number of bidders is large enough; 3.
The perceived reparability of a bid may influence the bid amount, with reparable bids reaching a lower equilibrium point and perceived irreparable bids being more aggressive.
It is important that mutual bid bonds do not result in depressed bidding in equilibrium.
They assumed all bidders were risk-neutral, but surmised that it is entirely possible for the bid-taker to collect a risk premium from risk-averse bidders with the offer of such insurance.
Whilst the WSS framework provides ample flexibility and  expressiveness, scalability becomes a problem for larger auctions.
Although solutions to larger auctions tend to be naturally more  robust, some bid-takers in such auctions may require robustness.
For many distributions of costs and estimates, equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the variability of the estimating distribution is sufficiently large.
There is another interesting direction this work may take, namely robust mechanism design.
Bidding strategies can become complex in  non-incentive-compatible mechanisms where winner determination is no longer  necessarily optimal.
[10] examined reformulation of CSPs for finding super solutions.
We leave an in-depth analysis of the sufficient conditions for more aggressive bidding for future work.
Three  major results arose from their study of bid withdrawal in a single item auction: 1.
In procurement settings the principle of free disposal is often discounted and all items must be sold.
