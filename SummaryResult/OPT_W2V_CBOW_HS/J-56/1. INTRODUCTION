In terms of combinatorial auctions, a robust solution is one that can  withstand bid withdrawal (a break) by making changes easily to form a repair solution of adequate revenue.
A robust solution that is  tolerant of such breaks is preferable.
We then propose an auction model in Section 4 that enhances reparability by introducing mandatory mutual bid bonds, that may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27].
However, reallocating items may be regarded as disruptive to a solution in many real-life scenarios.
Section 5 presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the approach presented in this paper, in the context of a number of well-known combinatorial auction distributions, with very encouraging results.
We have called this the Bid-taker"s Exposure Problem that bears similarities to the Exposure  Problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items.
Revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such  auctions, but another desirable attribute is solution robustness.
These bidders may associate a higher value for these items if they were combined with items already awarded to others, hence the bid-taker is left in an undesirable local optimum in which a form of backtracking is required to reallocate the items in a manner that results in sufficient revenue.
We propose the use of the Weighted Super 183 Solutions (WSS) framework [13] for constraint programming, that is ideal for establishing such robust solutions.
Robustness may be regarded as a preventative measure protecting against future uncertainty by  sacrificing revenue in place of solution stability and reparability.
Such  auctions are gaining in popularity and there is a proliferation in their usage across various industries such as telecoms, B2B procurement and transportation [11, 19].
This motivates the use of robust solutions and Section 3 introduces a constraint programming (CP) framework, Weighted Super Solutions [13], that finds such  solutions.
Section 2 presents the  Winner Determination Problem (WDP) for combinatorial auctions,  outlines some possible reasons for bid withdrawal and shows how  simply maximizing expected revenue can lead to intolerable revenue losses for risk-averse bid-takers.
In such situations the bid-taker may be left with a set of items deemed to be of low value by all other bidders.
Section 6 discusses possible extensions and questions raised by our research that deserve future work.
Consider a scenario where procurement for a business is conducted using a CA.
Repair solutions are required for bids that are seen as brittle (i.e.
A brittle solution to a CA is one in which an unacceptable loss in revenue is unavoidable if a winning bid is withdrawn.
We assume a probabilistic approach whereby the bid-taker has  knowledge of the reliability of bidders from which the likelihood of an incomplete transaction may be inferred.
A combinatorial auction (CA) [5] provides an efficient means of allocating multiple distinguishable items amongst bidders whose perceived valuations for combinations of items differ.
Repairs may also be required for sets of bids deemed brittle.
This paper is organized as follows.
As we shall see, this framework can enforce constraints on solutions so that  possible breakages are reparable.
likely to break).
It would be highly undesirable to retract contracts from a group of suppliers because of the failure of a third party.
Finally, in Section 7 a number of concluding remarks are made.
