However, the effectiveness of  stemming for English query systems was previously reported to be rather limited.
Our approach is unique in that it performs predictive stemming on a per query basis without relevance feedback from the Web, using the context of the variants in documents to preserve precision.
A more general problem related to stemming is query reformulation [3, 12] and query expansion which expands words not only with word variants [7, 22, 24, 25].
To  decide which expanded words to use, people often use  pseudorelevance feedback techniquesthat send the original query to a search engine and retrieve the top documents, extract  relevant words from these top documents as additional query words, and resubmit the expanded query again [21].
We use a similar corpus based approach for stemming by computing the similarity between two words based on their distributional context  features which can be more than just adjacent words [15], and then only keep the morphologically similar words as  candidates.
Stemming has to be decided on case by case basis, not only at the query level but also at the document level.
However, due to the limited number of tested queries (less than 100) and the small size of the collection, the results are hard to generalize to Web search.
They also proposed selective stemming based on query length and term importance, but no positive results were reported.
Thus query expansion based on  pseudorelevance and query reformulation can provide suggestions to users for interactive refinement but can hardly be directly used for Web search.
These mixed results, mostly failures, led early IR researchers to deem stemming irrelevant in general for English [4], although recent research has shown stemming has greater benefits for retrieval in other languages [2].
On the other hand, stemming is much more conservative since most of the time, stemming  preserves the original search intent.
Corpus analysis is used to improve Porter stemmer [26] by creating equivalence classes for words that are  morphologically similar and occur in similar context as measured by expected mutual information [23].
On the other hand, Krovetz [14] performed  comparisons over small numbers of documents (from 400 to 12k) and showed dramatic precision improvement (up to 45%).
Blind stemming, or a simple query length based selective stemming as used in [9] is not enough.
Our method predicts the quality of  expansion based on oï¬„ine information without sending the query to a search engine.
With quality stemming, good documents which were not selected before stemming will be pushed up and those low quality documents will be degraded.
While most work on query expansion focuses on recall enhancement, our work focuses on increasing both recall and precision.
Our results will affirm researchers that  stemming is indeed very important to large scale information retrieval. 
In addition, query expansion, including query reformulation [3, 12], has a high risk of changing the user intent (called query drift).
Using stemming in information retrieval is also a well known technique [8, 10].
[6] proposed a method for selective query expansion based on comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the results from the unexpanded query and the results from the  expanded query.
This is similar to the relevance feedback in the sense that it requires multiple passes retrieval.
In summary, we propose a novel approach to attack an old, yet still important and challenging problem for Web search - stemming.
[17] compared the Lovins and Porter algorithms and found little improvement in  retrieval performance.
Later, Harman [9] compares three  general stemming techniques in text retrieval experiments  including pluralization handing (called S stemmer in the  paper).
It"s simple, yet very  efficient and effective, making real time stemming feasible for Web search.
Since the expanded words may have different meanings, adding them to the query could potentially change the intent of the original query.
The Porter stemmer is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in many applications.
This normally requires sending a query multiple times to search engine and it is not cost effective for processing the huge amount of queries involved in Web search.
If a word can be expanded into several words, it requires running this process multiple times to decide which expanded word is useful.
However, the Porter stemming makes many mistakes  because its simple rules cannot fully describe English  morphology.
We suspect the previous failures were mainly due to the two problems we mentioned in the  introduction.
On selective query expansion, Cronen-Townsend et al.
As we will show, if  handled correctly, significant improvement can be achieved.
It is expensive to deploy this in production Web search engines.
Stemming is a long studied technology.
The increase on recall is obvious.
Many stemmers have been developed, such as the Lovins stemmer [16] and the Porter stemmer [18].
