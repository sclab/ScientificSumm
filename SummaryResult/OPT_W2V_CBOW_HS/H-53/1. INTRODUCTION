As we have to point out, the method we propose is not limited to pluralization handling, it is a general stemming technique, and can also be applied to general query expansion.
In addition, it reduces system performance because the search engine has to match all the word variants.
When examining the results of applying stemming to a large number of queries, one usually finds that nearly equal  numbers of queries are helped and hurt by the technique [6].
One problem of traditional stemming is its blind  transformation of all query terms, that is, it always performs the same transformation for the same query word without considering the context of the word.
A second problem of traditional stemming is its blind matching of all occurrences in documents.
We describe the details of the context sensitive stemming approach in Section 3.
On the query side, we propose a statistical language modeling based approach to predict which word variants are better forms than the original word for search purpose and expanding the query with only those forms.
However, the query running shoes is much more likely to give better search results than the original query because documents matching the intent of this query usually contain the words running shoes.
Stemming during indexing allows very little flexibility during query processing, while stemming by query expansion allows  handling each query differently, and hence is preferred.
Transforming book store to match book stores is fine, but matching book storing or booking store is not.
One of the important issues in Web search is that user queries are often not best formulated to get optimal results.
For example, running shoe is a query that occurs frequently in query logs.
We then perform extensive  experiments on a major Web search engine to support our claims in Section 4, followed by discussions in Section 5.
For the query book store, expanding both words to all of their variants significantly increases computation cost and hurts precision, since not all of the variants are useful for this query.
Stemming can be done either on the terms in a document  during indexing (and applying the same transformation to the query terms during query processing) or by expanding the query with the variants during query processing.
Experiments on general  stemming yield additional significant improvements over  pluralization handling for long queries, although details will not be reported in this paper.
Thus, one needs to be very cautious when using stemming in Web search engines.
Thus, a document containing the fragment reading a book in coffee stores will be matched, causing many wrong  documents to be selected.
One traditional solution is to use  stemming [16, 18], the process of transforming inflected or  derived words to their root form so that a search term will match and retrieve documents containing all forms of the term.
Although traditional stemming increases recall by  matching word variants [13], it can reduce precision by retrieving too many documents that have been incorrectly matched.
A weighting method that gives variant words smaller weights alleviates the problems to a certain extent if the weights accurately reflect the importance of the variant in this particular query.
For example, the word book has four forms book, books, booking, booked, and store has four forms store, stores, storing, stored.
To alleviate these two problems, we propose a context sensitive stemming approach for Web search.
In the rest of the paper, we first present the related work and distinguish our method from previous work in Section 2.
On the document side, we propose a conservative context sensitive matching for the transformed word variants, only matching document occurrences in the context of other terms in the query.
Although we hope the ranking  function can correctly handle these, with many more candidates to rank, the risk of making mistakes increases.
The motivation for using  pluralization handling as an example is to show that even such simple stemming, if handled correctly, can give significant benefits to search relevance.
Our solution consists of two context sensitive analysis, one on the query side and the other on the document side.
As we will show in the experiments, this is true even if we simplify stemming to pluralization handling, which is the process of converting a word from its plural to singular form, or vice versa.
Correctly formulating a query requires the user to  accurately predict which word form is used in the documents that best satisfy his or her information needs.
As far as we know, no  previous research has systematically investigated the usage of pluralization in Web search.
For the query book store, a transformation that allows the variant stores to be matched will cause every occurrence of stores in the document to be treated equivalent to the query term store.
Thus, the word run will match running, ran, runs, and shoe will match shoes and shoeing.
Our model is simple yet effective and efficient, making it feasible to be used in real commercial Web search engines.
However uniform weighting is not  going to work and a query dependent weighting is still a  challenging unsolved problem [20].
We use pluralization handling as a running example for our stemming approach.
Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6. 
Web search has now become a major tool in our daily lives for information seeking.
This is  difficult even for experienced users, and especially difficult for non-native speakers.
