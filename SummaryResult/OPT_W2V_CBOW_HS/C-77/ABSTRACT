A distributed computation is usually modeled as a partially ordered set of relevant events (the relevant events are a  subset of the primitive events produced by the computation).
An important causality-related distributed computing  problem, that we call the Immediate Predecessors Tracking (IPT) problem, consists in associating with each relevant event, on the fly and without using additional control messages, the set of relevant events that are its immediate predecessors in the partial order.
The family is defined by a general condition that allows application  messages to piggyback control information whose size can be smaller than n (the number of processes).
According to the way the general condition is implemented, different IPT protocols can be obtained.
This paper addresses the IPT problem: it presents a family of  protocols that provides each relevant event with a timestamp that exactly identifies its immediate predecessors.
So, IPT is the on-the-fly computation of the transitive reduction (i.e., Hasse diagram) of the causality relation defined by a distributed computation.
In that sense, this family defines message size-efficient IPT protocols.
Two of them are exhibited.
