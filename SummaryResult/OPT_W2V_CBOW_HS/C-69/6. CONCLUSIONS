We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.
pTHINC transparently supports traditional  desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with  ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.
Our results on multiple  mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.
We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs.
In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content  accessible to mobile web users. 
pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing,  clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI  elements.
