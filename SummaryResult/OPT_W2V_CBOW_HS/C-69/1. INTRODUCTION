Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.
Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become  simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server  capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications.
First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.
While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.
Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.
pTHINC"s  virtual display approach leverages semantic information  available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web  applications.
The increasing ubiquity of wireless networks and  decreasing cost of hardware is fueling a proliferation of mobile  wireless handheld devices, both as standalone wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) and popular integrated PDA/cell phone devices.
To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing).
Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.
Section 2 describes the overall usage model and  usability characteristics of pTHINC.
Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or  restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.
We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing  applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing  software.
This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.
Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.
Our experimental results demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.
First, because PDAs have a completely different  hardware/software environment from traditional desktop  computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.
This paper presents the design and implementation of pTHINC.
Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.
Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.
pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of  different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.
Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.
For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for  display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously.
A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote  display protocol.
It is likely that within a few years, most of the devices accessing the web will be mobile.
Section 3 presents the  design and system architecture of pTHINC.
The thin-client model provides several important  benefits for mobile wireless web.
Service providers are leveraging these devices to deliver pervasive web access, and mobile web users already often use these devices to access web-enabled information such as news, email, and localized travel guides and maps.
The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server.
Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop  computing counterparts [10].
Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting  application performance.
Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.
These devices are enabling new forms of  mobile computing and communication.
As a result, PDA web browsers are  often not able to display web content from web sites that  leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience.
Section 4 presents experimental results measuring the performance of pTHINC on web applications and comparing it against native PDA browsers and other popular PDA thin-client systems.
Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs,  providing greater functionality and better performance [10].
Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the  applications from the server to the client.
We have quantitatively evaluated pTHINC against  local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches on Pocket PC devices.
Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater  functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.
This fundamental problem arises for two  reasons.
pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a  thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices.
This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.
Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.
Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler  devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and  extend143 ing battery life.
Finally, we present some  concluding remarks. 
Section 5 discusses related work.
