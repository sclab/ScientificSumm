Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.
We can observe about 30% across all anchor settings when we increase the number of scans from 4 to 8.
As shown in Figure 25, 20 motes were placed as five groups in front of the speaker, four nodes in each group at roughly the same distances to the speaker.
In the  outdoor system, a Dell A525 speaker is used to generate 4.7KHz sound as shown in Figure 20.
When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy  (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).
9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.
9.2 Outdoor System Evaluation The outdoor system evaluation contains two parts: (i)  effective detection distance evaluation, which shows that the node sequence can be readily obtained, and (ii) sound  propagation based localization, which shows the results of  wavepropagation-based localization.

The average error of the localization results is 3 feet and the maximum error is 5 feet with one un-localized node.

For  example, Figures 23(b) shows that when we set the protection band at 0.05 feet, iterative MSP achieves 0.7 feet accuracy, which is 42% more accurate than the basic design.
9.2.2 Sound Propagation Based Localization As shown in Figure 20, 20 motes are placed as a grid  including 5 rows with 5 feet between each row and 4 columns with 4 feet between each column.
Figure 23(a) shows that a  protection band of 0.35 feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 8.57feet/s.
In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.
We found that sequence flip in wave propagation is more severe than that in the indoor, line-based test.
Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds.
We note that with a 0.35 feet protection band, the percentage of unlocalized nodes is very small, e.g., in the worst-case with 11 anchors, only 2 out of 46 nodes are not localized due to flipping.
Impact of the Number of Anchors and Scans 9.1.3 On Number of Anchors and Scans In this experiment, we show a tradeoff between hardware cost (anchors) with soft cost (events).
Figure 19 shows that a long tilted line is generated by the projectors.
In the  system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node.
As distance between each group increases, number of flips in the resulting node sequence 27 Figure 25.
Figure 27 shows the localization results using iterative MSP (3 times iterative processing) with a protection band of 3 feet.
Interesting phenomena can be  observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.
9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.
For example, with only 3 anchors, we can achieve 0.6-foot accuracy with 8 scans.
y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans.
This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only  increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.
With 11 anchors we can achieve a  localization accuracy as low as 0.25 âˆ¼ 0.35 feet, which is nearly a 60% improvement.
Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.
Similarly,  Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show the double-edged effects of  protection band on the localization accuracy.
The y-axis shows the detection rank (order) of each node in the node sequence.
Similarly, with increasing number of scans, the accuracy drops significantly as well.
We place 20 MICAz motes in the backyard of a house.
The gap between each group is set to be 2, 3, 4 and 5 feet respectively in four  experiments.
Figures 24(b) and 24(c) show the tradeoff between number of anchors and the number of scans.
Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s.
9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several  realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation.
The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node  sequence.
Obviously, with the number of anchors increases, the error drops significantly.
Currently we use MICAz mote, which is equipped with a low quality  microphone.
In all of our graphs, each data point represents the average value of 50 trials.
Each board in the system can be used as an individual sub-system, which is powered, controlled and metered separately.
Despite the hardware  constrains, the MSP algorithm still successfully localized most of the nodes with good accuracy.
The first one is called Mirage, a large indoor test-bed composed of six 4-foot by 8-foot boards, illustrated in Figure 19.
With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.
Figure 24(a) shows that with more cutting lines created by anchors, the chance of  unlocalized nodes increases slightly.
First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and  message losses.
Unless  mentioned otherwise, the default setting is 3 anchors and 6 scans at the scanning line speed of 8.6 feet/s.
For example, in the 2-foot distance subgraph, there are quite a few flips between nodes in adjacent and even  nonadjacent groups, while in the 5-foot subgraph, flips between different groups disappeared in the test.
Six 4KHz acoustic wave  propagation events are generated around the mote grid by a speaker.
Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show clearly that iterative MSP (with adaptation) achieves best performance.
Since the location is not completely open, sound waves are reflected, scattered and absorbed by various objects in the vicinity, causing a multi-path effect.
We have implemented all five versions of MSP on the Mirage test-bed, running 46 MICAz motes.
Figure 26 shows the results.
There are four nodes in each group (4 bars).
The x-axis in each  subgraph indicates the group index.
This is expected due to the high propagation speed of sound.
In this section, we present a system implementation of MSP on two physical test-beds.
9.2.1 Effective Detection Distance Evaluation We firstly evaluate the sequence flip phenomenon in wave propagation.
We believe that using a better speaker and more events, the system can yield better accuracy.
Localization Error (Sound) decreases.
We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3.
Three Hitachi CP-X1250 projectors,  connected through a Matorx Triplehead2go graphics expansion box, are used to create an ultra-wide integrated display on six boards.
