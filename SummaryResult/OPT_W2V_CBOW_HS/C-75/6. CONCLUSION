Based on the components of the architecture, several resources were modelled forming a grid of intrusion detection.
DIDSoG presents new research opportunities that we would like to pursue, including: deployment of the model in a more realistic environment such as a Grid; incorporation of new security services; parallel analysis of data by Native IDSs in multiple hosts.
In addition to the integration of IDSs enabled by a grid middleware, the cooperation of heterogeneous IDSs can be viewed as an economic problem.
The integration of distinct IDSs could be observed through the simulated environment.
Various resources were modelled following the architecture components forming a grid of intrusion detection.
The communication and localization services provided by GridSim were used to integrate components of different resources.
This work thus proposed a model for composition of DIDS by integrating existing IDSs on a computational Grid platform (DIDSoG).
During the simulation, the different IDSs cooperated with one another in a distributed manner; however, in a coordinated way with an integrated view of the events, having, thus, the capability to detect distributed attacks.
The integration of heterogeneous IDSs is important.
IDSs from different organizations or administrative domains need incentives for joining a grid of intrusion detection services and for collaborating with other IDSs.
The components of DIDSoG architecture have served as base for the integration of the resources presented in the simulation.
Some work focus on either the development of DIDSs on computational Grids or the application of IDSs to computational Grids.
However, none deals with the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.
Resources providing different intrusion detection services were integrated (e.g.
Services for communication and localization were used to carry out the integration between components of different resources.
In contrast, the proposed model developed and simulated in this work, can shed some light into the question of integration of heterogeneous IDSs.
IDSs in DIDSoG are encapsulated as Grid services for intrusion detection.
Related work presents cooperation between components of a specific DIDS.
A computational Grid platform is used for the integration by providing the basic requirements for communication, localization, resource sharing and security mechanisms.
The components of the architecture of the DIDSoG were developed and evaluated using the GridSim Grid simulator.
This capability demonstrates that the IDSs integrated have resulted in a DIDS.
The development of distributed strategy proof mechanisms for integration of IDSs is a challenge that we would like to tackle. 
Data from the sensor resources was read and this data was used to feed other resources of DIDSoG.
The simulation demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed model.
However, the incompatibility and diversity of IDS solutions make such integration extremely difficult.
