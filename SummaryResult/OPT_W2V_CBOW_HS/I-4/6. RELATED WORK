In our work, the negotiation involves more  complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.
Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an  approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the  negotiation chain scenario occurs.
However, this work is limited since it only involves a single agent"s perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part of a negotiation chain.
It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) and a  cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions of the DCOP.
A mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all.
However, in a combinatorial auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of  negotiations.
A combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to  solving the negotiation chain problem.
Fatima, Wooldridge and Jennings [1] studied the multiple issues in negotiation in terms of the agenda and negotiation procedure.
This would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed when the same-deadline policy is used.
