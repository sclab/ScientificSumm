This can eliminate  unnecessary communication and the initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G. CONFLEX-G can achieves performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and exploits more computing resources by allowing the use of multiple PC clusters in the grid.
In order to explore the conformation of large bio-molecules,  CONFLEXG was used to generate trial structures of the molecules, and allocate jobs to optimize them by molecular mechanics in the grid.
We plan to refine the conformational optimization  algorithm in CONFLEX to explore the conformation space search of larger bio-molecules such HIV protease using up to 1000 workers in a grid environment. 
This feature is especially important in large-scale applications which require lengthy calculation in a grid environment.
We need to refine the algorithm used to generate the trial structure in order to improve the load balance optimization for trial structures in CONFLEX.
In the  current OmniRPC, the registration of an execution program to remote hosts and deployments of worker programs are  manually set.
The experimental result shows that CONFLEX-G achieved a speedup of 56.5 times for the 1BL1 molecule, where the molecule consists of a large number of atoms and each trial structure optimization requires a great deal of time.
In grid environments in which the environment changes dynamically, it is also necessary to support fault tolerance.
OmniRPC provides a restricted persistence model so that the module is automatically initialized at invocation by calling the initialization procedure.
Deployment tools will be required as the number of remote hosts is increased.
Future studies will include development of deployment tools and an examination of fault tolerance.
The load imbalance of the trial structure optimizations may cause performance degradation.
We have designed and implemented CONFLEX-G using OmniRPC.
We reported its performance in a grid testbed of several geographically distributed PC clusters.
