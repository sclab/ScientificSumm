When all of the trial structures related to a given initial structure are optimized, only the master  procedure is used in comparison.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which  determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is pre-defined.
a barrier-crossing step in the elementary process of the  thermal conformational inter-conversion.
Selection of an initial structure among the previously discovered unique conformers sorted in a  conformational database.
By parallelizing CONFLEX, the speedup of searching molecular conformers obtained is as reported in[11]. 
Applications of CONFLEX include the elucidation of the reactivity and  selectivity of drugs and possible drug materials with regard to their conformational flexibility.
Generation of trial structures by local perturbations to the selected initial structure.
The selection rule of the initial structure, the  LowestConformer-First rule, is the second strategy for directing the conformation search expanded to the low-energy regions.
Geometry optimization for the newly generated trial structures.
CONFLEX [1] is an efficient conformational space search program, which can predominately and exhaustively search the conformers in the lower-energy region.
Therefore, we parallelized this  optimization using the Master/Worker parallelization technique.
(An input structure is used as the first initial structure at the beginning of a search  execution only.)
Comparison of the successfully optimized (trial)  structures with the other conformers stored in a  conformation database, and preservation of newly discovered unique conformers in the database.
Actually, the  perturbations of an initial structure correspond to the precise  performance around the space of the initial structure because of localization and weakness of the perturbation.
In the CONFLEX search algorithm, the geometry  optimization procedures always take 95% of the elapsed time of the search execution.
2.2 Parallelization of CONFLEX for Cluster For application to over 100 atoms, CONFLEX was  improved using high-performance parallel computing techniques.
The initial structure is selected as the set of lowest energy conformers stored in the conformation database.
2.1 Algorithm of ConformationalSpaceSearch The basic strategy of CONFLEX is an exhaustive search of only the low-energy regions.
After trial structures are generated (step 2), they are temporarily stored in a task pool on the master node.
These methods provide a highly efficient way to produce several good trial structures.
This rule is effective in moving down the search space toward lower energy regions, like water from a stream running into an empty reservoir, while filling local depressions along the way.
These perturbations can be considered to mimic 155 Stepwise Rotation Corner Flap Edge Flip Figure 2: Strategies used to generate the local  perturbations.
Therefore, these tactical procedures of the CONFLEX search are referred to as the Reservoir Filling Algorithm.
After an optimization on a worker node is finished, the worker is immediately supplied with another trial structure.
Figure 1 shows the outline of CONFLEX, the original  conformational space search algorithm.
Then, each worker node is dynamically supplied with one trial structure from the master node.
We modified the search procedures as follows.
Gradually increasing SEL allows only the  lowenergy conformers to be searched and avoids straying into unnecessarily high-energy regions.
The first strategy involves both corner  flapping and edge flipping for the ring atoms and stepwise  rotation for side-chains or backbone chains.
Figure 2 shows the strategies for generating local perturbations in CONFLEX.
These procedures incorporate two unique strategies.
The original CONFLEX performs the following four major steps: 1.
