Most of these efforts explicitly develop a docking  application as a parallel application using a special purpose parallel programming language and middleware, such as MPI, which requires development skills and effort.
Recently, an algorithm has been developed that solves the problems of parallelization and communication in poorly connected processors to be used for simulation.
SETI@home[14] is a program to search for alien life by analyzing radio telescope signals using Fourier transform radio telescope data from telescopes from different sites.
SETI@home tackles immensely parallel problems, in which calculation can easily be divided among several computers.
Ninf-G[7] is a grid-enabled implementation of Ninf and provides a GridRPC[10] system that uses LDAP to manage the database of remote  executables, but does not support clusters involving private IP  addresses or addresses inside a firewall.
Nimrod has been applied to  applications including bio-informatics, operations research, and molecular modeling for drug design.
Nimrod/G[15] is a tool for distributed parametric  modeling and implements a parallel task farm for simulations that require several varying input parameters.
Nimrod  incorporates a distributed scheduling component that can manage the scheduling of individual experiments to idle computers in a local area network.
However, the skills and effort required to develop a grid application may not be required for OmniRPC.
[16] has also discussed several design issues related to grid RPC systems.
NetSolve[8] is an RPC facility similar to OmniRPC and Ninf, providing a similar programming interface and  automatic load balancing mechanism.
This has  allowed us to simulate folding for the first time and to directly examine folding related diseases.
The  Folding@home project[13] simulates timescales thousands to  millions of times longer than previously achieved.
Radio telescope data chunks can easily be assigned to  different computers.
