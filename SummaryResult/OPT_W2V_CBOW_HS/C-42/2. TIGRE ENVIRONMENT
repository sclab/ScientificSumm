The TIGRE resource status and loads are monitored by the Grid Port Information Repository (GPIR) service of the GridPort toolkit [13] which interfaces with local cluster load monitoring service such as Ganglia.
A native Grid-mapfile that contains a list of authorized DNs is used to authenticate and authorize user job scheduling and management on TIGRE site resources.
The pertinent details of TIGRE services and tools for job scheduling and management are provided below.
The TIGRE site administrator can control the resource sharing through a powerful built-in scheduler provided by GridWay or by extending GridWay"s external scheduling module to provide their own scheduling policies.
This is accomplished through the Grid User Management System (GUMS) [12].
It also helps TIGRE sites to install the needed components on resources distributed throughout the participating sites.
The certificate revocation lists (CRL) are updated on a daily basis to maintain high security standards of the TIGRE Grid services.
The GPIR utilizes cron jobs on each resource to gather site specific resource characteristics such as jobs that are running, queued and waiting for resource allocation. 
The authentication and authorization of Grid jobs are managed by issuing Grid certificates to both users and hosts.
It is designed to provide efficient use of dynamic Grid resources by multiple users for Grid infrastructures built on top of Globus services.
The purpose of choosing a minimal software stack is to support applications at hand, and to simplify installation and distribution of client/server stacks across TIGRE sites.
The links for OTRS and Wiki are consumed by the TIGRE portal [2] - the gateway for users and resource providers.
In the present work, we have employed GridWay [8] metascheduler - a Globus incubator project - to schedule and manage jobs across TIGRE.
The high bandwidth file transfer protocols such as GridFTP are utilized for staging files in and out of the target machine.
Customer Service Management System A TIGRE portal [2] was designed and deployed to interface users and resource providers.
The login to remote hosts for compilation and debugging is only through GSISSH service which requires resource authentication through X.509 certificates.
Job Scheduling and Management The TIGRE environment supports GRAM4-based job submission via web services.
The PacMan [10] packaging and distribution mechanism is employed for TIGRE client/server installation and management.
The TIGRE portal [2] documentation area provides a quick start tutorial on running jobs on TIGRE.
For up-to-date information on securing user and resource certificates and their installation instructions see ref [2].
The TIGRE client/server stack consists of an authentication and authorization layer, Globus GRAM4-based job submission via web services (pre-web services installations are available up on request).
The TIGRE environment is supported by open source tools such as the Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) [14] for servicing trouble tickets, and MoinMoin [15] Wiki for TIGRE content and knowledge management for education, outreach and training.
The web services GRAM translates the XML scripts into target cluster specific batch schedulers such as LSF, PBS, or SGE.
The TIGRE Grid middleware consists of minimal set of components derived from a subset of the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) [9] which supports a variety of operating systems.
This approach allows the clients to keep current, consistent versions of TIGRE software.
The users and hosts on TIGRE are identified by their distinguished name (DN) in their X.509 certificate provided by the CA.
The tools for handling Grid proxy generation, Grid-enabled file transfer and Grid-enabled remote login are supported.
Metascheduler The metascheduler interoperates with the cluster level batch schedulers (such as LSF, PBS) in the overall Grid workflow management.
The PacMan distribution mechanism involves retrieval, installation, and often configuration of the packaged software.
509 user and resource Grid certificates [11].
Certificate Authority The TIGRE security infrastructure includes a certificate authority (CA) accredited by the International Grid Trust Federation (IGTF) for issuing X.
The TIGRE Institutions serve as Registration Authorities (RA) for their respective local user base.
Application users can write job descriptions using GridWay"s simple and direct job template format (see Section 4 for details) or standard Job Submission Description Language (JSDL).
It was designed using GridPort [13] and is maintained by TACC.
At Texas Tech University, the users are dynamically allocated one of the many generic pool accounts.
The job submission scripts are generated using XML.
Additional components will be added as they become necessary.
The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas at Austin is the TIGRE"s shared CA.
The GridWay is a light-weight metascheduler that fully utilizes Globus functionalities.
See section 4 for implementation details.
