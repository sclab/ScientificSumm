The Schlumberger ECLIPSE software is used for these simulations.
We have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology for the TIGRE Grid computing environment.
In this paper, we provide an account of our efforts in  Gridenabling the ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation methodology.
Since models in the ensemble do not communicate, message-passing implementation is a good choice.
In this approach, an ensemble of geological models and production data of oil fields is used to forecast the dynamic response of oil wells.
By pooling the licenses and computing resources across the collaborating institutions using GridWay metascheduler and TIGRE environment, the computational accuracy can be increased while reducing the simulation runtime.
Ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology is a popular approach for hydrocarbon reservoir simulations in energy exploration.
Potential benefits of this approach, observations and lessons learned will be discussed.
Each model checks out an ECLIPSE license and therefore, parallelizability of reservoir simulations depends on the number licenses available.
