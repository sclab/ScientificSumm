This approach has several advantages over MPI implementation especially when a site specific cluster is heavily loaded and/or the number licenses required for the simulation is more than those available at a single site.
Towards the future work, it would be interesting to compare the runtime between MPI, and Grid implementations for the EnKF application.
Another aspect of interest in the near future would be managing both compute and license resources to address the job (or processor)-to-license ratio management. 
We have demonstrated that by pooling licenses across TIGRE sites, more geological models can be handled in parallel and therefore conceivably better simulation accuracy.
This effort could shed light on quality of service (QoS) of Grid environments in comparison with cluster computing.
Within the energy exploration application area, we have Grid-enabled the MPI implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology for reservoir characterization.
TIGRE is a higher education Grid development project and its purpose is to sustain and extend research and educational opportunities across Texas.
This task was accomplished by removing MPI code for parallel processing and replacing with single processor jobs one for each geological model in the ensemble.
These single processor jobs were scheduled across TIGRE via GridWay metascheduler.
