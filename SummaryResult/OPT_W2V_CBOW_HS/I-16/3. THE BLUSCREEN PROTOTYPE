In more detail, the responsibilities of each agent types are: Bluetooth Device Detection Agent: This agent monitors the  environment in the vicinity of a BluScreen display and  determines the number and identity of any Bluetooth devices that are close by.
Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as  possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user.
Advertising Agent: This agent represents a single advert and is responsible for submitting bids to the marketplace agent in order that it may be allocated advertising cycles, and thus, display its advert to users.
The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times.

The interactions of these agents are implemented through a web services protocol2 , and they constitute a decentralised marketplace that allocates  advertising space in an efficient and timely manner.
Rather than requiring the deployment of specialised hardware, such as active badges (see [11] for details), BluScreen detects the presence of users in the vicinity of each display through the Bluetooth-enabled devices that they carry with them everyday1 .
It keeps historical records of the arrival and departure of Bluetooth devices, and makes this information available to advertising agents as requested.
This system uses a 23 inch flat-screen  display deployed within an office environment to advertise events and news items.
Thus, having described the prototype BluScreen system, we next go on to describe the details of the auction mechanism that we consider in this work, and then the advanced bidding agent that operates bids within this auction. 
Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware.
BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable,  advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor  environment.
On the basis of this information, its past  experiences, and its bidding strategy, it calculates the value of the bid that it should submit to the marketplace agent.
It interacts with the device  detection agent in order to collect information regarding the number and identity of users who are currently in front of the display.
Of the 212 Bluetooth devices detected,  approximately 70 were detected regularly, showing that Bluetooth is a  suitable proxy for detecting individuals in front of the screen.
A single marketplace agent represents each BluScreen display, and access to this screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles of fixed duration.
The winner of this auction is allocated access to the display during the next cycle.
Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.
This approach is attractive since the Bluetooth wireless protocol is characterised by its relative maturity, market penetration, and emphasis on short-range communication.
Marketplace Agent: This agent facilitates the sale of advertising space to the advertising agents.
In order to achieve a scalable and extendable solution a  multiagent systems design philosophy is adopted whereby a number of different agents types interact (see figure 2).
To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.
1 Devices must be in discovery mode to detectable.
Before the start of each advertising cycle, the marketplace agent holds a sealed-bid auction (see section 4 for more  details).
Table 1 summarises the number of devices detected by this prototype installation over a six month period.
264 The Sixth Intl.
To date, a prototype systems that addresses the first two goals has been demonstrated [8].
