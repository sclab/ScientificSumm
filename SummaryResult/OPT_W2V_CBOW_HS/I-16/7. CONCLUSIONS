pected utility, measured as the number of users who the advertising agent exposes its advert to, was shown to depend on these factors, and resulted in a complex expression where the expected utility of each auction depended on the success or otherwise of earlier  auctions.

In this paper, we presented an advanced bidding strategy for use by advertising agents within the BluScreen advertising system.
We presented an algorithm based upon simulated annealing to solve for the optimal bidding strategy, and in simulation, this bidding strategy was shown to significantly outperform a simple bidding strategy that had none of these features.
This bidding strategy enabled advertising agents to model and predict the arrival and departure of users, and also to model their  success within a first-price sealed bid auction by observing both the bids that they themselves submitted and the winning bid.
Our future work in this area consists of extending this bidding strategy to richer environments where there are multiple  interrelated display screens, where maintaining profiles of users allows a richer matching of user to advert, and where alternative auction mechanisms are applied (we a particularly interesting in  introducing a ‘pay per user" auction setting similar to the ‘pay per click" auctions employed by internet search websites).
Its performance closely approached that of a central optimal allocation, with  perfect knowledge of the arrival and departure of users, despite the uncertain environment in which the strategy must operate.

This work will continue to be done in conjunction with the deployment of more BluScreen prototypes in order to gain further real world experience.
