ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.
The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does.
In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.

Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest
