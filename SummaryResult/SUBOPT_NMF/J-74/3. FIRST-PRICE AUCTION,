Theorem 3.
Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.
However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.
In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation : bi ( θi ) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F ( bi ( x ) ) + ( 1 − Pa
