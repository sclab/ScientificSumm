Note that p1 = dm/dn, the instantaneous price per share, and m = R n 0 p1(n)dn.
Substituting into equation (4), we get: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 âˆ’ 1 i (6) Equation 6 gives the cost of purchasing n shares.
That is, p1 = P2 p2 = P1.
For example , the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m ( 100 ) /100 , another ask order for 100
