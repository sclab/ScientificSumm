This  paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.
• Real-valued variables.
I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that  always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple  percentage values that must sum to 100).
I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or  combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.
I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.
