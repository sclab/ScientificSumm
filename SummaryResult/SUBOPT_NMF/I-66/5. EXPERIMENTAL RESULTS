With both the  approximations, we obtained a solution quality that was close to the optimal solution quality.
For 5-P configuration, the global optimal algorithms did not terminate within the limit of 10000 seconds, so the bar for optimal quality indicates an upper bound on the optimal solution quality.
X-axis denotes the approximation parameter, Î´  (percentage to optimal) used, while Y-axis denotes the time taken to compute the solution (on a log-scale).
SPIDER-Abs dominated the SPIDER and GOA for all the configurations.
X-axis denotes the approximation parameter , used , while Y-axis denotes the time taken to compute the solution (
