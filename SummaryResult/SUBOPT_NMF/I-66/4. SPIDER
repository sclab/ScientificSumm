For the value provided by the heuristic to be admissible, it should be an over estimate of the expected value for a joint policy.
Thus, we need to show that: For l ∈ Ei+ ∪ Ei− : ˆvt l ≥ vt l (refer to notation in Section 4.2) We use mathematical induction on t to prove this.
Output of this technique is a policy with an expected value that is at least δ% of the optimal solution quality.
Irrespective of whether l ∈ Ei− or l ∈ Ei+ , ˆrt l is computed by maximizing over all actions of the agents
