The key differences between SPIDER and MAA* are: (a) Enhancements to SPIDER (VAX and PAX) provide for quality guaranteed approximations, while MAA* is a global optimal algorithm and hence involves significant  computational complexity; (b) Due to MAA*"s inability to exploit  interaction structure, it was illustrated only with two agents.
This aspect of quality bounds differentiates SPIDER from all the above techniques.
This algorithm is based on the combination of a classical heuristic search algorithm, Aâˆ— and decentralized control theory.
