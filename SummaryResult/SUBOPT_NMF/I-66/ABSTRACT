allowing easier scale-up to larger number of agents); (ii) it uses a combination of heuristics to speedup policy search; and (iii) it allows quality guaranteed approximations,  allowing a systematic tradeoff of solution quality for time.
This paper overcomes the limitations of both these approaches by providing SPIDER, a novel combination of three key features for policy generation in  distributed POMDPs: (i) it exploits agent interaction structure given a network of agents (i.e.
A second less popular approach focuses on global optimality, but typical results are available only for two agents, and also at considerable computational cost.
Experimental results show orders
