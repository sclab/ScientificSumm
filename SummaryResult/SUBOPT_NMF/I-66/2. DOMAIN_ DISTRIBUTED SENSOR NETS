Based on the area it is scanning, each sensor receives observations that can have false positives and false negatives.
Thus, sensors have to act in a coordinated fashion.
We assume that there are two independent targets and that each target"s movement is uncertain and unaffected by the sensor agents.
In Figure 1, to track a target in  Loc11, sensor1 needs to scan ‘East" and sensor2 needs to scan ‘West" simultaneously.
To track a target and obtain associated reward, two  sensors with overlapping scanning areas must coordinate by scanning the same area simultaneously.
