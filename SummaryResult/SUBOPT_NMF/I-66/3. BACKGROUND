An ND-POMDP is similar to an n-ary Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP)[8, 12] where the variable at each node represents the policy selected by an individual agent, πi with the domain of the variable being the set of all local policies, Πi.
3.2 Algorithm: Global Optimal Algorithm (GOA) In previous work, GOA has been defined as a global optimal algorithm for ND-POMDPs [10].
Based on the reward function, an interaction hypergraph is constructed.
, an is the joint action  performed in state s = s1, .
environmental factors like target locations that no agent can control.
Thus , given a policy for
