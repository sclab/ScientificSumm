We first propose the basic SPIDER (Search for Policies In Distributed EnviRonments) algorithm.
We then provide three enhancements to improve the  efficiency of the basic SPIDER algorithm while providing guarantees on the quality of the solution.
In contrast, the second less popular category of  approaches has focused on a global optimal result [13, 5, 10].
In our experiments, we illustrate that SPIDER dominates an existing global optimal approach called GOA [10], the only known global optimal algorithm with demonstrated experimental results for more than two agents.
Furthermore , they fail to exploit structure in the interactions of the agents and
