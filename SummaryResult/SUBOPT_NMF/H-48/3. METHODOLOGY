In the most extreme case (i.e., when the length of the query is less than or equal to the number of query terms removed from the relevant documents), there will be no term overlap between a query and its relevant documents.
Query terms are removed from documents one by one, so the differences in IR system performance can be  measured with respect to missing terms.
Although test collections are difficult to come by, it should be noted that this evaluation framework can be used on any available test collection.
It is in this way that we can explicitly measure the
