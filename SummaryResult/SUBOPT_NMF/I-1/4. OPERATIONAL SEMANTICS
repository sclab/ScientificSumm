(a(v ) ∧ ancestorof(v, v ) ∧ v = v ) - v has no active children.
• sa(v) ≡ ∃v .abort(v ) ∧ ancestorof(v , v) - we should abort v, i.e., abort is true of v or some ancestor; however, we need to wait until no children of v are active.
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) • f(v) - the program of pap v has failed.
The idea is that , whenever a new pap occurs , the prependID ( v , v ) action is used to create a new pap identifier list v from the existing
