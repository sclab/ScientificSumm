These goals are  specified by the agent programmer and attached to tasks, much like our FAb(P, PF , PA) construct associates failure and abort  methods with a plan P. Note, however, that in contrast to both [6] and our semantics, [21] attach the failure-handling knowledge at the goal, not plan, level.
Failure-handling goals are invoked according to  failurehandling strategy rules, by a dedicated agent Failure Handling  Component (FHC) that tracks task execution.
While our approach is  defined at the plan level, our extended BDI semantics provides for the separation of execution and failure handling.
The FHC approach is independent of
