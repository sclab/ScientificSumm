Distributing UDDI functionality can be achieved in multiple ways and perhaps using different distributed computing infrastructure/platforms (e.g., CORBA, DCE, etc.).
In this paper we explore how Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology can be leveraged to develop a scalable distributed web services discovery architecture.
In the next section, we provide a brief overview of grid information services, UDDI and its limitations, which is followed by an overview of DHTs in Section 3.
Grid discovery services provide the ability to monitor and discover resources and services on grids.
