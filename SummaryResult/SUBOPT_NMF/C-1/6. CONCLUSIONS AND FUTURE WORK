An example of another service discovery mechanism that could benefit from such an approach is Globus Toolkit"s MDS.
Furthermore, we plan to investigate other aspects of grid service discovery that extend this work.
The paper has solved the scalability issues with UDDI but does not preclude the application of this approach to other service discovery mechanisms.
Some of these aspects include the ability to subscribe to resource/service information, the ability to maintain soft states and the ability to provide a variety of views for various different purposes.
Based on initial prototype testing , we believe that DUDE architecture
