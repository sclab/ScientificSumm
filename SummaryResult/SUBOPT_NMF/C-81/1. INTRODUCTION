Consequently, battery powered systems usually operate at the lowest performance level that meets the minimum data fidelity requirement in order to maximize the system life.
There exist many techniques to accomplish performance scaling at the node level, such as radio transmit power adjustment [1], dynamic voltage scaling [2], and the use of low power modes [3].
Environmental energy is distinct from battery energy in two ways.
Energy harvesting systems, on the other hand, can provide enhanced performance depending on the available energy.
However, these techniques require hardware support and may not always be available on resource constrained sensor nodes.
