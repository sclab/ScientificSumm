System model for an energy harvesting system.
For the calculation of the optimal strategy, we assume complete knowledge of the energy availability profile at the node, including the availability in the future.
The energy used directly from the harvested source and the energy stored and used from the battery must be accounted for differently.
We can write the energy used from the battery in any slot i as : ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] ( ) ( ) { } ( ) ( ) [ ] 1 1c cs s sB i B i TD
