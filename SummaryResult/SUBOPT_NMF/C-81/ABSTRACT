We present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data.
We also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source.
The algorithm has three objectives, namely (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment, (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above  energyneutrality constraint, and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time.
Our methods are evaluated using data
