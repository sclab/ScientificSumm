Several other power scaling methods, such as DVS,  submodule power switching and the use of multiple low power modes are also available.
It is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit these advanced capabilities. 
It is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the duty cycle.
Our method has significant advantages over currently used methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and can only provide sub-optimal performance.
Specifically, we designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the constraint of energy neutral operation.
However , this work is only the first
