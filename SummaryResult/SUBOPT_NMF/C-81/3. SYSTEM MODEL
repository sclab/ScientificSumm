A more interesting case is when the harvested energy is used as the primary source of energy for the system with the objective of achieving indefinitely long system lifetime.
Most low power systems use batteries to store energy and provide residual battery status.
For instance, in some systems, the harvested energy may marginally supplement the battery supply and the objective may be to maximize the system lifetime.
Further, for energy sources that exhibit both long-term and short-term patterns (e.g., diurnal and climate variations vs. weather patterns for solar energy), the model must be able to capture both characteristics.
