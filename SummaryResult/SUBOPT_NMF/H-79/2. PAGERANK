If averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i iP N jP B F )()1( )( α α (1) Where Fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and Bj is the set of pages that link to page j.
In order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.
Computing PageRank requires iterating
