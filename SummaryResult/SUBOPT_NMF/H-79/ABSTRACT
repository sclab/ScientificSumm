We use RankNet, a ranking machine learning algorithm, to combine these and other static features based on anchor text and domain characteristics.
The resulting model achieves a static ranking pairwise accuracy of 67.3% (vs. 56.7% for PageRank or 50% for random).
Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning.
We gain a further boost in accuracy by using data on the frequency at which users visit Web pages.
H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval.
We show that we can significantly outperform PageRank using features that are independent of the link structure of the Web.
