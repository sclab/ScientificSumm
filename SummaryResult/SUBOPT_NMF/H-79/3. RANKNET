This function can still be applied anywhere that a  regressionlearned function could be applied.
As with back-prop, RankNet attempts to minimize the value of a cost function by adjusting each weight in the network according to the gradient of the cost function with respect to that weight.
Static ranking can be seen as a regression problem.
However, this over-constrains the problem we wish to solve.
The goal of the ranking problem , then , is to learn a function f such that , ) ( ) ( , , ji ffji xxZ > ∈∀ 708 Note that , as with
