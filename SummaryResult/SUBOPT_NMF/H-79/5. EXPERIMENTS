Table 2: Results for individual feature sets.
Feature Set Accuracy (%) PageRank 56.70 Popularity 60.82 Anchor 59.09 Page 63.93 Domain 59.03 All Features 67.43 Because we are using a two-layer neural network, the features in the learned network can interact with each other in interesting, nonlinear ways.
Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.
