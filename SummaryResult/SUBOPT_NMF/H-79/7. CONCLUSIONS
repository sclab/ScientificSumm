By combining many static features, fRank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than PageRank alone.
We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.
The machine learning component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.
A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank ; by using popularity data , it is
