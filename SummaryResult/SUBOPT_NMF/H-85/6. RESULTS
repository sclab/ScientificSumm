Figure 6.3 reports recall-precision curves for the CD+CDiff and UserBehavior methods for different test query sets with at least 1 click (Q1), 10 clicks (Q10) and 20 clicks (Q20) available per query.
We consider the effects of having sufficient interaction data available for a query before proposing a re-ranking of results for that query.
Interestingly, Query-text alone has low accuracy (only marginally better than Random).
In contrast, the current search engine always makes a prediction for every result for a given query.
Nevertheless , our CD+CDiff clickthrough strategy outperforms most recent state-of-the-art results by a large margin ( 0.72 precision
