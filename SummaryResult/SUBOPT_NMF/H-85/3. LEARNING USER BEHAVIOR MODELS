To model this aspect of user experience we defined features to characterize the nature of the query and its relation to the snippet text.
For clarity, we organize the features into the groups Query-text, Clickthrough, and Browsing.
These features allows us to model intra-query diversity of page browsing behavior (e.g., navigational queries, on average, are likely to have shorter page dwell time than transactional or informational queries).
The resulting distribution agrees with previous observations that users click more often on top-ranked results.
