We show that our model of clickthrough interpretation improves prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art clickthrough methods.
Our key insight to improving robustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from the expected noisy user behavior.
Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Search process, relevance feedback.
General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Performance, Experimentation. 
We generalize our approach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough, which results in higher preference prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone.
Accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking , click spam detection , web search personalization ,
