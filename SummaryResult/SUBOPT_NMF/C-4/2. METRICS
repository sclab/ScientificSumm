Due to the limited memory of the system, the last state X = m is just defined as crm consecutive packets lost, with P(X = m) being the state probability.
Given the case of a finite number of packets a for a flow, which experiences d = cpC1 ]cok packet drops, we have the  relative frequency pL,k = 2 (P(X = k) for a + 00) for the occurence of a loss burst of length lc.
We define a loss run length lc for a sequence of Ic consecutively lost packets detected at sj ( sj > Ic > 0 ) with Z
