While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).
