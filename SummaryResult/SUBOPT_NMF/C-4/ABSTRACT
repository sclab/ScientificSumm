We first develop an end-to-end model based on loss  runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow.
Using this  framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs (PCM) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact.
We show that  significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually  identical to best effort in the long term.
These packet-level metrics are then linked to user-level objective speech quality metrics.
As both
