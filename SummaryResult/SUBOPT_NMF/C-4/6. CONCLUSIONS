The  SPBDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority  packets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the decoder"s concealment for other frames.
Frame-based codecs amplify on one hand the impact of loss by error  propagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.
This is the case because they neither need the addition of redundancy nor feedback (which would incur additional data and delay overhead) and thus yield stable voice quality also for higher loss rates due to absence of FEC and feedback loss.
