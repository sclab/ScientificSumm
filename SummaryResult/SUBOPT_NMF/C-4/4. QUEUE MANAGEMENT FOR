The necessary relationship between the drop probabilities for packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85  follows (note that this relationship is valid both at the  end-tend level and every individual hop): Let a = a0 + a+, +a-~ be the overall number of emitted packets by an FT flow and a,, + E [-l,O, +l] be the number of packets belonging to a certain class (where the 0 class corresponds to (unmarked) best effort traflic).
