When a frame is lost or corrupted, the G.729 decoder uses the parameters of the previous frame to interpolate those of the lost frame.
The line spectral pair coefficients (LSP3) of the last good frame are repeated and the gain coefficients are taken from the previous frame but they are damped to gradually reduce their impact.
Interestingly the loss correlation (dp parameter) has some impact on the speech quality,  however, the effect is weak pointing to a certain robustness of the G.729 codec with regard to the resiliency to consecutive packet losses due to the internal loss concealment.
