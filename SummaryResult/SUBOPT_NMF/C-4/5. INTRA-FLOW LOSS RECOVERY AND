Our simulations (Fig.
As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq.
This should â€˜The appropriateness of the simple end-to-end modeling used has been investigated in [12] with discrete event  simulation using a multi-hop topology and detailed modeling of foreground and background traffic sources.
Therefore we use a separate one-state Markov model (Bernouilli model) to describe the network behaviour as seen by each class of packets.
also allow a reasonable evaluation of how losses in the fl class affect the
