We define C(SO) as: C(SO) = min S C(S) (7) where S varies over all possible strategy profiles.
In this analysis we use simply α in place of αij , since we deal with a single object and we assume placement cost is the same for all servers.
If the replica is placed at i, then the second condition ensures there is no incentive to drop the replica because no two servers separated by distance less than α both place replicas.
Network (b) shows the social optimum where two replicas, one for each cluster, are placed.
The first constraint
