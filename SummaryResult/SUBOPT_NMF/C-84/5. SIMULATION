Furthermore, when α exceeds the overlay diameter, the number in Nash equilibria stays constant when p varies.
The set of servers with demand is random for p < 1, so we  calculate the expected PoA by averaging over 5 trials (each data point is based on 5000 runs).
We observe in Figure 4 that for α ≥ 0.4, the average number of replicas of Nash equilibria gets closer with payments to that of the social optimum than it does without.
The Ratio for the payment game is much lower than the Ratio for the basic game , since the protocol for
