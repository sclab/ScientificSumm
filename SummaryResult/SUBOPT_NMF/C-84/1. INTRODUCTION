The price of anarchy bounds the worst possible behavior of a selfish system, when left completely on its own.
21 quantified by the price of anarchy [21].
â€¢ If pure strategy Nash equilibria do exist, how efficient are they (in terms of the price of anarchy, or its optimistic  counterpart) under different placement costs, network topologies, and demand distributions?
The price of anarchy of the basic game model can be O(n), where n is the number of servers; the intuitive reason is undersupply.
Our simulation results show several interesting phases.
Once all servers have chosen a strategy , each
