In that case, the price of anarchy is O(n).
We intend to compute the bounds of the price of anarchy under different underlying topologies such as random graphs or  growthrestricted metrics.
First, the PoA in the payment game can be worse than the PoA in the basic game.
Another  observation we made was that the number of replicas in a Nash  equilibrium can be more than the number of replicas in the social  optimum even without payments.
All nodes have demands of one.
Such aggregation can reduce the inefficiency of Nash equilibria.
While exploring the caching problem , we
