The payment necessary for another server to place a replica is at least α.
B does not have an incentive to deviate, since accessing the remote replica does not decrease its cost.
If node i replicates the object, j is the  nearest node to i among the other nodes that replicate the object, and dij < α in a Nash equilibrium, then i should have a threshold at 25 least (α − dij).
CLAIM 1.
Also, for all i, bi = 0.
THEOREM 2.
Consider the new configuration φnew wherein i does not replicate and each node in Qi chooses its next
