We show the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria and investigate the price of anarchy, which is the relative cost of the lack of coordination.
In our model, nodes incur either cost for  replicating resources or cost for access to a remote replica.
The price of anarchy can be high due to undersupply problems, but with certain network topologies it has better bounds.
With a  payment scheme the game can always implement the social optimum in the best case by giving servers incentive to replicate.
We refer to this as the  selfish caching problem.
We analyze replication of resources by
