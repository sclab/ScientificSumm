Although we have presented results on only the item-based algorithm with list rank accuracy as the metric, the same approach outlined here applies to user-based algorithms and other metrics.
We also aim to extend our  formulation to other collaborative filtering algorithms, study the effect of shilling in altering rating roles, conduct field studies, and evaluate improvements in user experience by tweaking ratings based on their role values.
A fine-grained characterization in terms of rating roles such as scouts, promoters, and connectors, as done here, helps such an endeavor.
In future research , we plan to systematically study the many algorithmic
