In particular, we formulate three roles-scouts, promoters, and connectors-that  capture how users receive recommendations, how items get  recommended, and how ratings of these two types are  themselves connected (resp.).
These roles find direct uses in  improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of items and, most importantly, in helping monitor the health of the system as a whole.
We argue that the three rating roles presented here provide broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community.
We present a novel study that disaggregates global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each individual rating , allowing us to
