Recommendation lists are lists of items in decreasing order of prediction (sometimes stated in terms of star-ratings), and so predictive accuracy may not be reflective of the accuracy of the list.
[12], typically compute predictive accuracy by dividing a set of ratings into training and test sets, and compute the prediction for an item in the test set using the ratings in the training set.
Similarity computed in this manner is typically scaled by a factor proportional to the number of common ratings , to reduce the chance of making a recommendation made on weak connections : sim ( u
