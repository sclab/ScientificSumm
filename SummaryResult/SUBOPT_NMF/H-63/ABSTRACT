Access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme.
Push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast.
Two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes.
None of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data (LDD) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination.
Push based broadcast [ 1 ] is essentially asymmetric , i.e. , the volume of data being higher from the server to
