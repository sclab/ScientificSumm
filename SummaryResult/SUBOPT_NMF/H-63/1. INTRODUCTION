The main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures.
Tuning time refers to the time during which the mobile unit (MU) remains in active state to tune the channel and download its required data.
The exponential schemes facilitate index replication by sharing links in different search trees.
It also allows the user to personalize his own mobile device by selectively tuning to the information of his choice.
We show with simulation results that our scheme outperforms some of the earlier indexing schemes for broadcasting LDD in terms of tuning time.
