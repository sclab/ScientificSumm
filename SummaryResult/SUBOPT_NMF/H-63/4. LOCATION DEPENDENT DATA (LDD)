If a town is the finest granularity, then it defines the terminal condition for association between IC and LH for weather.
The granularity match between the weather and a LH node is as per user requirement.
We define GPS for IC (GPSIC) ⊆ GPS and for LH (GPSLH) ⊆ GPS as GPSIC = {P1, P2,…, Pn}, where P1, P2, P3,…, Pn are properties of its members and GPSLH = {Q1, Q2,…, Qm} where Q1, Q2,…, Qm are properties of its members.
It is generally true that ( property set ( mi∈ IC ) ∪ property set ( mj∈
