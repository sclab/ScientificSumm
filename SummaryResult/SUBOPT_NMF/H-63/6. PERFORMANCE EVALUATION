We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the length of broadcast increases.
For smaller broadcast size, the LBIS seems to have larger tuning time than the other two schemes.
Figure 5-8 shows the relative tuning times of three indexing algorithms, ie, the LBIS, exponential scheme and the distributed tree scheme.
This action is not possible in the distributed tree indexing and hence we can observe that its tuning time is more than the LBIS scheme, although it performs better than the exponential scheme.
