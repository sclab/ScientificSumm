We also do not mean to claim that our representations should  replace more elaborate modeling languages like Promela or reactive modules.
The solutions, proposed in this paper, are not necessarily  perfect (for example, the impression functions ini seem to be the main source of non-modularity in MIS, and can be perhaps  improved), but we believe them to be a step in the right direction.
We also conjecture that the complexity of model checking strategic ability for our representations is higher if we assume perfect information than if we assume imperfect  information.
We only suggest that there is a need for
