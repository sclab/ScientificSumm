The semantics of logics like the ones presented in Section 2 are usually defined over explicit models (Kripke structures) that enumerate all possible (global) states of the system.
More precisely: modal logics that combine branching time, knowledge, and strategies under  incomplete information.
In Section 3, we present an overview of representations that have been used for modeling and model checking systems in which time, action (and possibly knowledge) are important; we mention especially  representations used for theoretical analysis.
Multi-agent systems are open systems, in the sense that agents interact with an environment only partially known in advance.
We start with
