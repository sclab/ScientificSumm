Still, this is a minor complaint in the context of CTL, because for temporal logics we are only interested in the flow of transitions, and not in the underlying actions.
The situation is different when we talk about autonomous,  proactive components (like agents), acting together (cooperatively or adversely) in a common environment - and we want to address their strategies and abilities.
Moreover, they allow for  representing explicit interaction between local transitions of reactive  processes, like willful communication, and synchronization.
Moreover , the availability of actions ( to an agent ) should not depend on the actions that will be executed
