, k} of agents; set St of states; valuation of propositions π : Π → P(St); set Act of atomic  actions.
Formally, the recursive definition of ATLir formulae is: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | A ir fϕ | A ir2ϕ | A irϕ U ϕ Models of ATLir, concurrent epistemic game structures (CEGS), can be defined as tuples M = Agt, St, Act, d, o, ∼1, ..., ∼k, Π, π , where Agt, St, Act, d, o, Π, π is a CGS, and ∼1, ..., ∼k are  epistemic (equivalence) relations.
We assume that all ∼a are equivalences.
