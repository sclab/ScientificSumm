In this paper, we mostly investigate the convergence of such systems towards global consistency.
We study a critical situation involving a number of agents aiming at  escaping from a burning building.
We first show that (for a wide class of protocols that we shall define), the communication constraints induced by the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system, at the condition that the system dynamics guarantees that no agent will ever be isolated forever, and that agents have  unlimited time for computation and arguments exchange.
However , we further assume that communication opportunities are severely constrained and change
