Figure 3: Comparative effectiveness ratio gain of protocols when the proportion of agents augments The first observation that needs to be made is that  communication improves the effectiveness of the process, and this ratio increases as the number of agents grows in the system.
In this case, the local protocol is different (note in  particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that agents" motivation to communicate is to synchronise their list of observations, not their hypothesis).
Local broadcast means that all the neighbours agents perceived by an
