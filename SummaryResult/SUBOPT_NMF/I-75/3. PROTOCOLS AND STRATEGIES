on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1001 hypothesis, which in turn, since agents are autonomous,  implies at least one exchange of observation.
We then have again two possibilities: (case iia) ak and ap did not communicate since t0.
Then there are two possibilities: (case i) ak and al communicate at time t .
