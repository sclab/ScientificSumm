[20, 15, 19, 9, 12]), rather than studying the  complexity of designing the mechanism.
The closest piece of  earlier work studied the complexity of automated mechanism design by a benevolent designer [5, 6].
Roughgarden has studied the complexity of designing a good network  topology for agents that selfishly choose the links they use [21].
Some of it has focused on  issues of computational complexity, but most of that work has strived toward designing mechanisms that are easy to  execute (e.g.
This is related to mechanism design , but differs significantly in that the designer only has restricted control over the
