We then showed that allowing randomization in the mechanism makes the design problem in all these settings computationally easy.
We showed that here, too, designing an  optimal deterministic mechanism is NP-complete even with one agent, but designing an optimal randomized mechanism is easy.
Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their  preferences truthfully, and a desirable outcome is chosen.
Finally , we showed that the paymentmaximizing AMD problem is closely related to an interesting variant of the optimal ( revenue-maximizing ) combinatorial auction design problem , where
