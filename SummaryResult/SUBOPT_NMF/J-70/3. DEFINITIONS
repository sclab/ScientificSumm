Given an automated mechanism design  setting, a mechanism is said to implement its outcome and payment functions in dominant strategies if truthtelling is always optimal even when the types reported by the other agents are already known.
2 We do not randomize over payments because as long as the agents and the designer are risk neutral with respect to payments, that is, their utility is linear in payments, there is no reason to randomize over payments.
× ΘN , and any alternative type report ˆθi ∈ Θi, in the case of  deterministic mechanisms we have ui(θi, o(θ1, .
Given an
