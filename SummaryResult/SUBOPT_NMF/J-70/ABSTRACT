The reason that the agents" preferences are relevant is that the center is  constrained to making each agent at least as well off as the agent would have been had it not participated in the mechanism.
This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization  problem needs to be solved anew each time.
In this setting , we show that designing optimal deterministic mechanisms is NP-complete in two important special cases : when the center is interested only in the payments made to it , and when payments are not possible and the center is
