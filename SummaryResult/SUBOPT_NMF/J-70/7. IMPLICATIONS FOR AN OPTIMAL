Then, if the AMD solution chooses outcome o for a type, in the optimal auction solution, allocate {so} to the bidder for this type.
Now suppose there exists a solution to the optimal auction design instance.
To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary  paymentmaximizing deterministic AMD instance, with a single agent and a uniform distribution over types, to the following  optimal combinatorial auction design problem instance with a single bidder with best-only preferences.
By the at-most-one-item observation, we can  without loss of generality restrict ourselves to allocations where each bidder receives at most one item.
We now show that the
