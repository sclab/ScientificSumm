The resulting outcome is the outcome of the new mechanism.
Given this, we can focus on truthful mechanisms in the rest of the paper. 
The agents report their preferences (or types) to the interface layer; subsequently, the interface layer inputs into the original mechanism the types that the agents would have strategically reported to the original mechanism, if their types were as declared to the interface layer.
However, because here we focus on flatly represented outcome and type spaces, this is not a concern here.)
We build an interface layer between the agents and the original  mechanism.
This does ,
