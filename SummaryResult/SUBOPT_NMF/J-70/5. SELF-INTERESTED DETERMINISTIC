By the above, for any type θv, the value of the objective function in this mechanism will be |Θ|.
This has an objective value of 0, and because the highest value the objective function ever takes is |Θ| + 1, it follows that the maximum expected value of the objective function that could be obtained is at most (|Θ|−1)(|Θ|+1) |Θ| < |Θ| < G, contradicting that this is a  solution to the AMD instance.
( This is because we can not choose the outcome o∗ for such a type , as in this case the agent would have an incentive to report
