We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).
The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.
If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.
3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor  Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.
Because
