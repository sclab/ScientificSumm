This computational saving may be possible since (xi −v(c)) in the update equation of (6) does not depend on ¯U.
However, we cannot simply ignore ¯U as members of ¯U may still influence the excesses of groups that include agent i through group S. Specifically, if there exists a group T ⊃ S such that e(T) < e(S), then even when e(S ∪ {i}) has non-negative excess, e(T ∪{i}) may have negative excess.
The reserve of a coalition S relative to a coalition U is the minimum excess over all coalitions between S and
