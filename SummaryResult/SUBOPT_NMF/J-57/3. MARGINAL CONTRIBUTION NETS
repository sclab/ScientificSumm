Note that our representation may  require a space larger by a linear factor due to the need to describe the patterns for each rule.
Given a game in multi-issue representation, we start by describing each of the subgames, which are  represented in characteristic form in [3], with a set of rules.
Proposition 4.
For any singleton set {i}, we create a rule {i} â†’ v(i).
This can be captured by a scaled unit game.
There is no  overhead on top of that since there is a natural ordering of the groups.
We call this graph the agent graph.
