Efficiency: the efficiency of the algorithms we can develop for the representation.
The ideal representation should be fully expressive, i.e., it should be able to represent any coalitional games, use as little space as possible, have efficient algorithms for  computation, and be easy to use.
1.2 Evaluation Criteria for Coalitional Game Representation To capture the coalitional games described above and  perform computations on them, we must first find a  representation for these games.
For example , for the recommendation system game , a highly compact representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products , and
