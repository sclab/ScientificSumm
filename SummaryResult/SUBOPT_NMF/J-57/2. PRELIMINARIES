However, this representation is not general; it will not be able to  represent interactions among three or more agents.
Efficiency (EFF) A total of v(N) is distributed to the agents, i.e., i∈N φi(v) = v(N).
It has a very useful axiomatic characterization.
2.2 Previous Work Revisited Deng and Papadimitriou looked into the complexity of various solution concepts on coalitional games played on weighted graphs in [4].
For any given game, there may be multiple ways to decompose the game, and the decomposition may influence the computational complexity.
For example , it will not be able to represent any
