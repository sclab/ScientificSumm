Formally, let φi denote the Shapley value of i, p denote the cardinality of the positive set, and n denote the cardinality of the negative set, then φi = (p − 1)!n!
We can separate the analysis into two cases, one for rules with only positive literals and one for rules with mixed literals.
v = v p p+n n For a given negative literal j, j will be responsible for  cancelling the application of the rule if all positive literals come before the negative literals in the ordering, and j is the first among the negative literals.
