The concept of  symmetry is prevalent in games, and the use of classes of agents will allow us to capture symmetry naturally and concisely.
The use of functions will allow  concise description of marginal diminishing returns (MDRs).
They both address the issue of of conciseness of representation by using the combinatorial structure of weighted hypergraphs.
first apply these idea to games theory by introducing a representation scheme derived from Bayes net to represent non-cooperative games [6].
This is useful in situations where a certain agent represents a type of exhaustible resource , and therefore rules that depend on the presence
