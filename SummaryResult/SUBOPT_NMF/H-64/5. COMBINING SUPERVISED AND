All were implemented using McCallum"s BOW text classification library [14].
Having clustered the documents and trained a suitable classifier, the remaining 14,000 documents in the collection are labeled by means of automatic classification.
These scores may then be used to populate a relation browser interface, or they may be added to a  traditional information retrieval system.
Constructing mutually exclusive clusters violates our assumption that documents may belong to multiple classes.
Prind is a probabilistic version of the Rocchio classification algorithm [9].
Deriving topic scores via naive Bayes for the entire 15,000document collection required less than two hours of
