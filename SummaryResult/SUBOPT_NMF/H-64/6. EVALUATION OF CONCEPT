In addition to models fitted to the Editor"s Desk data, then, we constructed a fourth model, supplementing the training sets of each class by querying the Google search engine7 and applying naive Bayes to the augmented test set.
Because we have only 1279 documents and 10 classes, the number of training documents per class is relatively small.
However, the success of our classifiers on the Editor"s Desk documents that informed the cross validation study may not be good predictors of the models" performance on the remainder to the BLS website.
Using this methodology , we
