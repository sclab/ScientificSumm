Under the auspices of the GovStat Project, our goal is to identify a small number of semantically valid concepts that adequately spans the intellectual domain of a collection.
The goal of this discovery is twofold.
First we desire a practical aid for  information architects.
Second, automatically derived  documentconcept relationships are a necessary precondition for  realworld deployment of many dynamic interfaces.
The current study compares concept learning strategies based on three document representations: keywords, titles, and full-text.
In statistical and user-based studies, human-created keywords provide significant improvements in concept learning over both title-only and full-text representations.
