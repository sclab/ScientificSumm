In other words, it is  computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output.
2.2 Hash-Based Systems Ganesh"s focus is on efficient transmission of results by  discovering similarities with the results of previous queries.
A collection of data items  effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or network transmission.
While databases can be easily replicated in a LAN , this is infeasible in a WAN because of the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency , availability , and tolerance to
