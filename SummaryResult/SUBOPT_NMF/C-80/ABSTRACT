Using two benchmarks representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our  prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much as twofold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as tenfold for data intensive ones.
Further, Ganesh does not require modifications to applications, web servers, or database servers, and works with closed-source applications and databases.
We describe a middleware layer called Ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of queries or results.
These benefits do not require any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the back-end database.
