A previous study has shown that  approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1].
We also report Ganesh"s performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip  latency.
The benchmark is available in a  Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), Java Servlets, and PHP version and has different datasets; we evaluated Ganesh with the Java Servlets  version and the Expanded dataset.
We tested Ganesh with four client configurations where the number of test clients was set to 400, 800, 1200, and 1600.
Native avoids Ganesh '' s overhead in using a proxy and
