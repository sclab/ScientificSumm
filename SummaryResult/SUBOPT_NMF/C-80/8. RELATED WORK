Our evaluation of Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios.
To improve database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28] also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to  transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.
This simple yet elegant idea relies on  cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2.
Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link, duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and then restored at the remote end.
Further , unlike Ganesh , some of these mid-tier caching solutions [ 2 , 3 ] , suffer
