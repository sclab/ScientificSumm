The essence of the Ganesh architecture is the use of computation at the edges to reduce  communication through the Internet.
This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the database"s strict consistency semantics.
Ganesh is able to use  cryptographic hashes to detect similarity with previous results and send WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 319 compact recipes of results rather than full results.
Our design uses interposition to achieve complete transparency : clients , application servers ,
