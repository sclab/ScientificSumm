At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients  decreases the normalized response time as Ganesh"s average response time increases faster than Rabin"s. However, at no point does Rabin outperform Ganesh.
The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows similar trends.
Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with the exception of Rabin"s performance with 400 test clients.
In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.
Rabin '' s results for the Browsing Mix are normalized to Ganesh '' s results
