6.2.2 Automatic Relevance Feedback Scheme We designed an automatic feedback scheme to model the retrieval process.
For each submitted query, our system  retrieves and ranks the images in the database.
It is important to note that the automatic relevance  feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].
As the scope gets larger, the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller.
Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.
Also, the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM.
Therefore, the precision at top 20 (N = 20) is especially important.
In real world image retrieval
