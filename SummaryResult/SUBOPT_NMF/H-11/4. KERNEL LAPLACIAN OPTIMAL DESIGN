Let H⊥ be the orthogonal complement of H, i.e.
Let X−1 be the Moore-Penrose inverse (also known as pseudo inverse) of X.
Thus, for any function f ∈ HK , it has orthogonal decomposition as follows: f = fH + fH⊥ Now, let"s evaluate f at xi: f(xi) = f, Kxi HK = fH + fH⊥ , Kxi HK = fH, Kxi HK + fH⊥ , Kxi HK Notice that Kxi ∈ H while fH⊥ ∈ H⊥ .
Particularly, if we select a linear kernel for KLOD, then it reduces to LOD.
We have Ks, Kt HK = K(s, t).
