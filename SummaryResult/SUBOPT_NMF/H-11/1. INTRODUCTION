The study of optimal experimental  design (OED) [1] is concerned with the design of experiments that are expected to minimize variances of a parameterized model.
The intent of optimal experimental design is  usually to maximize confidence in a given model, minimize  parameter variances for system identification, or minimize the model"s output variance.
Despite many existing active learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) active learning [14] and regression based active learning [1] have received the most interests.
Benefit from recent progresses on optimal experimental design and semi-supervised learning , in this paper we propose a novel active learning algorithm
