Some recent work on experimental design can be found in [6], [16]. 
Different observations have errors that are  independent, but with equal variances σ2 .
2.2 Optimal Experimental Design We consider a linear regression model y = wT x + (1) where y is the observation, x is the independent variable, w is the weight vector and is an unknown error with zero mean.
Since the computation of the determinant and eigenvalues of a matrix is much more expensive than the computation of matrix trace, A-optimal design is more efficient than the other two.
• E-optimal design: maximum eigenvalue of Hsse.
• A-optimal
