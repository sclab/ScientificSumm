The user submits a query image example to the  system.
The system ranks the images in database  according to some pre-defined distance metric and presents to the user the top ranked images.
Our Laplacian Optimal Design algorithm is applied in the second step for selecting the most informative images.
In this work, We combine 64-dimensional color histogram and 64-dimensional Color Texture Moment (CTM, [15]) to represent the images.
General visual features includes color, texture, shape, etc.
This process can be viewed as an on-line learning process in which the image retrieval system acts as a learner and the user acts
