Thus, a new loss function which respects the geometrical structure of the data space can be defined as follows: J0(w) = k i=1 f(zi)−yi 2 + λ 2 m i,j=1 f(xi)−f(xj) 2 Sij (3) where yi is the measurement (or, label) of zi.
Let y = (y1, · · · , yk)T and X = (x1, · · · , xm).
Clearly, H is of full rank.
Therefore, minimizing J0(w) is an attempt to ensure that if xi and xj are close then f(xi) and f(xj) are close as well.
