In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian  Optimal Design (LOD), for relevance feedback image retrieval.
Our algorithm is based on a regression model which  minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space.
The challenge is thus to  determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples.
Experimental results on Corel database suggest that the proposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback  image retrieval.
