Suppose that the  relationship target is (T∗t α , T∗t β ).
The  following strategy uses the machinery described in Section 4.
Following from Equation 5 , α will want to achieve a negotiation target , Nβ ( Ψt ) such that : ν · Nβ ( Ψt ) + ( 1 − ν ) · V ∗t β is a bit on the T∗t β side of V ∗t β : Nβ ( Ψt ) = ν − κ ν V ∗t β ⊕ κ ν T∗t β ( 6 ) for small κ ∈ [ 0 , ν ] that
