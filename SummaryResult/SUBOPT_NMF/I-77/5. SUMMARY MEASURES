It makes sense to aggregate these values over a class of statements, say over those ϕ that are in the ontological context o, that is ϕ ≤ o: C(α, β, o) = 1 − P ϕ:ϕ≤o Pt β(ϕ) [1 − C(α, β, ϕ)] P ϕ:ϕ≤o Pt β(ϕ) where Pt β(ϕ) is a probability distribution over the space of statements that the next statement β will make to α is ϕ.
The intimacy between agents α and β , I∗t αβ , is the pattern of the two 2 × 5 arrays V ∗t α
