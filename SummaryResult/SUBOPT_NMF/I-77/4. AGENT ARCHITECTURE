Sα(β, a) is a random variable denoting α"s estimate of β"s subjective valuation of a over some finite, numerical evaluation space.
We also consider needs, the variable Tα(β, a) denotes α"s estimate of the strength of β"s motivating need for the enactment of commitment a over a valuation space.
Then as the agents share increasing amounts of their  information about their open market valuations g gradually reduces to 0, and then as they share increasing amounts of information about their needs h increases to 1.
We represent the relationship between
