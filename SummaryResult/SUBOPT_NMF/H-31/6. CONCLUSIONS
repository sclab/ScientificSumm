Our work opens up many interesting  directions for further exploration in this new family of models.
In  particular, we show that Poisson has an advantage over  multinomial in naturally accommodating per-term smoothing.
It is also appealing to find  robust methods to learn the per-term smoothing coefficients without additional computation cost. 
We compare the new models with the popular multinomial retrieval models both analytically and experimentally.
Furthermore, we show that a  mixture background model for Poisson can be used to improve the performance and robustness over the standard Poisson background model.
Our analysis shows that while our new models and multinomial
