As in existing language modeling approaches, the main challenge of constructing a reasonable retrieval model is to find a smoothed language model for p(·|d).
In other words, we may assume that there is exactly one non-query term in the vocabulary for each query.
2.2.1 Bayesian Smoothing using Gamma Prior Following the risk minimization framework in [11], we  assume that a document is generated by the arrival of terms in a time period of |d| according to the document language model, which essentially consists of a vector of Poisson rates for each term, i.e., Λd = λd,1, ..., λd,|V | .
The
