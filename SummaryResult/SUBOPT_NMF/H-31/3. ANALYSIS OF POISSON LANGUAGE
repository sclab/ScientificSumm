With the model p(q|ΛQ) hidden, the query likelihood is p(q|∆, U) = ΛQ w∈V ((1 − δw)p(c(w, q)|ΛQ) + δwp(c(w, q)|U))P(ΛQ|U)dΛQ If we have relevant documents for each query, we can  approximate the query model space with the language models of all the relevant documents.
Setting p(·|U) as p(·|C), the query likelihood becomes p(q|∆, U) = d∈C πd w∈V ((1−δw)p(c(w, q)|ˆΛd)+δwp(c(w, q)|C)) where πd = p(ˆΛd|U).
Poisson Mixture [ 3 ] has been proposed to model a collection of documents
