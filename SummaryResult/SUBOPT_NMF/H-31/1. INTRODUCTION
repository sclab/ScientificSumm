In particular, a key difference is that the Poisson model can naturally accommodate  perterm smoothing, which is hard to achieve with a multinomial model without heuristic twist of the semantics of a  generative model.
This new background model is shown to outperform the standard background model and reduce the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameter.
As in the existing work on multinomial language models, smoothing is critical for this new family of models.
Compared with multivariate Bernoulli , multinomial distribution has the advantage of being able to model the frequency of terms in the query ; in contrast
