However, the Poisson model in their paper is still under the document generation  framework, and also does not account for the document length variation.
[24] studies the parallel derivation of three  different retrieval models which is related to our comparison of Poisson and multinomial.
[26] introduces a way to empirically search for an exponential model for the documents.
Poisson distribution has been previously studied in the document generation models [16, 22, 3, 24], leading to the development of one of the most effective retrieval formula BM25 [23].
