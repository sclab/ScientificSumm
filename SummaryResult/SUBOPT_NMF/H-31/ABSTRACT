We present several variants of the new model corresponding to different smoothing  methods, and evaluate them on four representative TREC test collections.

We show that the Poisson model has several  advantages over the multinomial model, including naturally  accommodating per-term smoothing and allowing for more  accurate background modeling.
The results show that while their basic  models perform comparably, the Poisson model can outperform multinomial model with per-term smoothing.
The  performance can be further improved with two-stage smoothing.
We show that while in their simplest forms , the
