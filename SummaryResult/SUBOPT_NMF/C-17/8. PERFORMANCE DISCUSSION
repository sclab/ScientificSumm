8.2 Optimistic Algorithm The traffic can be reduced further.
ELSE IF there are (NMax-1) streams with LN>LNt then send top (NMax-1) plus the one lower than LNt (i.e., top NMax) to other CSs.
IF there are >= NMax streams with LN > LNt then send top NMax to other CSs.
As the packet period is of the order of 40ms, the error in the selection is unnoticeable.
At each M-CS/S-CS and for each packet time: B.
