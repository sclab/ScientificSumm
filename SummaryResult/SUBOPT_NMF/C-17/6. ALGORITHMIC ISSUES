The present amplitude level of the speaker is found by calculating the moving average of packet amplitude (XK) within a window called Recent Past Window starting from the present instant to some past time.
Three windows are defined as shown in Fig.
The activity of the speaker in the past is found with a window called Activity Horizon, which spans the recent past window as well as the distant past window and beyond if necessary.
There are cases wherein the processing capacity of an M-CS is exceeded as it may have too many packets - from local domains and from
