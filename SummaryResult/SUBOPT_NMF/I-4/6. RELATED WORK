In our work, the negotiation involves more  complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.
However, in a combinatorial auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of  negotiations.
This would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed when the same-deadline policy is used. 
A combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to  solving the negotiation chain problem.
It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem ( DCOP ) and a cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions of
