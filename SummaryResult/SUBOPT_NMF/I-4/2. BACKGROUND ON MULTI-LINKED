An agent involved in multiple related negotiation processes needs to reason on how to manage these negotiations in terms of ordering them and choosing the appropriate values for features.
A multi-linked negotiation problem is  defined as an undirected graph (more specifically, a forest as a set of rooted trees): M = (V, E), where V = {v} is a finite set of negotiations, and E = {(u, v)} is a set of binary relations on V .
2. negotiation start time (α(v)): the start time of negotiation v. α(v) is an attribute that needs to be decided by the agent.
