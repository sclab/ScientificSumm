However, the combination of these local optimal solutions {Slo i } : < Slo 1 , Slo 2 , ....Slo n > can be sub-optimal to a set of better local optimal solutions {Sblo i } : < Sblo 1 , Sblo 2 , ....Sblo n > if the global utility can be improved without any agent"s local utility being  decreased by using {Sblo i }.
The dash line in Figure 2 represents the  connection of these local optimization problem though the common negotiation subject.
The other direction is to find how to allocate time more efficiently for each negotiation in the negotiation chain context. 
The negotiation is tightly
