This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation  solution.
The experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agent"s and the system"s overall performance significantly.
We have introduced a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level information on related  negotiation issues.
Instead of solving the negotiation chain problem in a centralized approach, we adopt a distributed  approach where each agent has an extended local model and  decisionmaking process.
Using this information , the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the relationship of flexibility
