This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing a better negotiation solution in the global negotiation chain context.
The agent can also use this  information to allocate appropriate time for each negotiation, hence to find a good ordering of all related negotiations.
Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the  relationship of flexibility and success probability.
The  experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents" and the system"s overall performance significantly.
We introduce a pre-negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta-level information.
