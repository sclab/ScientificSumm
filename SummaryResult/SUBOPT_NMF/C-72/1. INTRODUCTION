This data must also be exchanged between potentially hundreds of neighboring secondary users at short time scales, to account for rapid changes in the RF environment.
This is more effective than uncoordinated approaches  because making decisions based only on local information is fallible (as shown in Figure 1).
RF spectrum changes incrementally: On most bands, RF spectrum utilization changes infrequently.
Therefore, if the usage pattern of a particular band changes  substantially, nodes detecting that change can initiate an  update protocol to update the information for that band alone, leaving in place information already collected for other bands.
