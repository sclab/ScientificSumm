The node then sets the ith bit in a bit vector (initially filled with zeros), where i is the number of coin tosses it performed.
When a node receives a bit vector, it updates its local bit vector by bitwise OR-ing it with the received vector (as shown in Figure 2 which computes AVERAGE).
Although such aggregates are very compact in nature , requiring only O ( logN ) state space ( where N is the number of nodes ) , they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2 ,
