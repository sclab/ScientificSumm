Signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 GHz), where λ is the wavelength [14].
Therefore, any time spent  communicating sensory information takes away from the device"s ability to perform its intended function.
Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50  devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 Mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.
By applying gossip and FM aggregation , aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to ( c·logN time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per
