Significance Threshold: RF spectrum bands  continually experience small-scale changes which may not  necessarily be significant.
Implementation Specifics: Finally, implementing  gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open.
Therefore, we recommend the use of  spatially decaying aggregates [6], which limits the impact of an update on more distant nodes.
As well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing  information.
If  implemented at the MAC layer, it may be feasible to piggy-back gossip messages over existing management frames (e.g.
networking advertisement messages).
There are a variety of alternatives for implementing such a channel , some of which
