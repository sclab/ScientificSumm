Figure 4(b) compares the execution times of  incremental random walk (IRWP) and standard random walk on a clique.
Although random walk and IRWP both use k random walks (in our simulations k = number of nodes), IRWP initiates walks only from  updated nodes (as explained in Section 5.2), resulting in faster information convergence.
This is because in the early steps of protocol execution, only devices which detect signal changes communicate.
In each run of the simulation, we induce a change in the measured signal at one or more devices.
Finally , in order to isolate the effect of protocol operation
