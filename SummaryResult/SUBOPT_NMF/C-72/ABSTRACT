We propose GUESS, a novel incremental gossiping approach to coordinated spectral sensing.
We focus on the problem of sharing RF spectrum data among a collection of wireless devices.
The inherent requirements of such data and the time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this problem both interesting and technically challenging.
Such radios must coordinate with each other to build an accurate and consistent map of spectral  utilization in their surroundings.
It ( 1 ) reduces protocol overhead by limiting the amount of information exchanged between participating nodes , ( 2 ) is resilient to network alterations , due to
