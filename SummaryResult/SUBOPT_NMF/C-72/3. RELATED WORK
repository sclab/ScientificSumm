[11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which  sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes.
More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.
As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].
In  contrast, GUESS does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments.

APs direct mobile clients to collect such sensing information on
