Recently, there has been increasing interest in the  mechanisms agents might use to choose how to act - the  rhetorical manoeuvring that they use to navigate through the space defined by the rules of the dialogue.
Key in such  considerations is the idea of relevance, since a usual requirement is that agents stay focussed on the subject of the dialogue and only make relevant remarks.
Here we study several notions of relevance, showing how they can be related to both the rules for carrying out dialogues and to rhetorical  manoeuvring.
