To show that AG has a single root, consider its  construction from the initial node.
After m2, the graph is two nodes connected by an edge, and v1 is now a root and not a leaf.
Thus AG is connected.
Every move mi+1 that is R3-relevant is R2-relevant.
For 1, consider how move mi+1 can satisfy R1.
For mi+1 to change the status of the root, it will have to (1) make the argument A represented by r either unacceptable, if it were acceptable before the move, or (2) acceptable if it were unacceptable before the move.
Now , further
