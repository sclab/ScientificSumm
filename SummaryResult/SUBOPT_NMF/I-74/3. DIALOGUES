In other words the notion of an argumentation graph allows for the representation of arguments that do not relate, by undercutting or being undercut, to any other arguments (we will come back to this point very shortly).
If there is an edge e from vertex v to vertex v , then v is said to be the parent of v and v is said to be the child of v. In a reversal of the usual notion, we define a root of an argumentation graph1 as follows: Definition 3.4.
Similarly: Definition 3.5.
The reason for the reversal of the usual notions
