Consider a basic dialogue D, with  argumentation graph AG which has root r denoting an  argument A.
This is not a sufficient condition on its own because certain  protocols may prevent - through additional restrictions, like strict turn-taking in a multi-party dialogue - all the nodes in AG(D)T , which is not subject to such restrictions, being added to the graph.
If argument A , denoted by node v is an an R2relevant move m , m is not R1-relevant if and only if : 1. there are two nodes v and v on the path between v and r ,
