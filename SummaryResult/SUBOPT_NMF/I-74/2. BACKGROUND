, Δn such that beliefs in Δi are all equally preferred and are preferred over elements in Δj where i > j.
Let A1 and A2 be arguments in A(Δ).
A1 is preferred to A2 according to Pref , A1 Pref A2, iff level(Support(A1)) > level(Support(A2)).
An argumentation system is a triple : A ( Δ ) , Undercut , Pref such that : • A ( Δ ) is a set of the arguments built from Δ , • Undercut is a binary relation representing the defeat relationship between arguments , Undercut ⊆ A ( Δ ) ×
