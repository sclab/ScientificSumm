We also  describe how our technique can be used to generate  meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query  suggestion/reformulation.
Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond  simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques.

We evaluate our  technique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique.
Our model  demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several TREC data sets.
