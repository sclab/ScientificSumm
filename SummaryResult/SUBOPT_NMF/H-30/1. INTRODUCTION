First, LCE provides a mechanism for combining term  dependence with query expansion.
The MRF model generalizes the unigram, bigram, and other various dependence models [14].
Therefore, by performing query expansion using the MRF model, we are able to study the dynamics between term dependence and query expansion.
There have been several approaches that make use of generalized concepts, however such approaches were somewhat heuristic and done outside of the model [19, 28].
Query expansion techniques have been well studied for various models in the past and have shown to significantly improve effectiveness in both the relevance feedback and pseudo-relevance feedback
