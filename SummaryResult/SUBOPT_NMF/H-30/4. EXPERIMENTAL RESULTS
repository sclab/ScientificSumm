As the results show, LCE exhibits strong robustness for each data set.
A highly robust expansion technique will significantly improve many queries and only minimally hurt a few.
Therefore, our experiments yield no conclusive results with regard to expansion using multi-term concepts.
For the ROBUST data set,  relevance models improve 67 queries and hurt 32, and LCE improves 77 and hurts 22.
We found that the two word concepts chosen often consisted of two highly correlated terms that are also chosen as single term concepts.
4.1.2 Expansion with Multi-Term Concepts We also investigated expanding using both single and two word
