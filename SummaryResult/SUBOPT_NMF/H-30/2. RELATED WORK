Expansion concepts were chosen and weighted using a metric based on co-occurrence statistics.
It is computed as: P(w|Q) = D P(w|D)P(D|Q) ≈ D∈RQ P(w|D)P(Q|D)P(D) w D∈RQ P(w|D)P(Q|D)P(D) (1) where RQ is the set of documents that are relevant or  pseudorelevant to query Q.
Given a query Q, a relevance model is a multinomial  distribution, P(·|Q), that encodes the likelihood of each term given the query as evidence.
This separates the content model from the background model.
The other technique , relevance models , is more closely
