This reconfirms previous observations that modeling  dependencies via the use of proximity features within the MRF has more of an impact on larger, noisier collections than smaller, well-behaved ones.
In fact, it achieves  significant improvements in mean average precision over relevance models across a selection of TREC data sets.
Future work will look at incorporating document-side dependencies, as well.
We also showed that the model is highly effective.
Finally, we reiterated the importance of choosing  expansion terms that model relevance, rather than the relevant documents and showed how LCE captures both syntactic and query-side semantic dependencies.
It was also shown
