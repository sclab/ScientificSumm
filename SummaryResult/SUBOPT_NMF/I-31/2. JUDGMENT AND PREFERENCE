We henceforth  implicitly assume that there are always at least two alternatives.
A  preference relation (over K) is, here, a total (linear) order on K, i.e., a relation R over K which is antisymmetric (i.e., (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R implies that a = b), transitive (i.e., (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R implies that (a, c) ∈ R), and total (i.e., either (a, b) ∈ R or (b, a) ∈ R).
