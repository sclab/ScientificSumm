Similarly for R with respect to .
In fact, our  axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of f. To be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ.
Axiom CpJS corresponds to the requirement that judgment sets are complete.
Axiom Atmost says that there is at most one item on the table at a time, and Atleast says that we always have an item on the table.
It is then easy to verify that , for every Δ ∈ Tables , and every formula ϕ , Δ |=
