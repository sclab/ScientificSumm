Assume that the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication (i.e., A contains p, q, p → q for some p, q ∈ L(L)).
Let γ be the  judgment profile γ = A1, A2, A3 where A1 = {p, p → q, q, .
In a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=L σ and f, γ, q |=L ¬σ.
4.1 The Discursive Paradox As illustrated in Example 1 , the following formula expresses proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p MV = σ ↔ G⊆Σ , |G| > n 2 i∈G i (
