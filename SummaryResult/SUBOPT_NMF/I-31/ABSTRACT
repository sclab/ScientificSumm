We present a sound and complete axiomatisation of such rules.
We present a modal logic that is intended to support reasoning about judgment aggregation scenarios (and hence, as a special case, about preference aggregation): the logical language is interpreted directly in judgment aggregation rules.
As a special case, judgment aggregation can be seen to subsume classical preference  aggregation.
The recently emerging field of  judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective, and considers how multiple sets of logical formulae can be  aggregated to a single consistent set.
We show that the logic can express aggregation rules such as majority voting
