Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.
The modal logic arrow logic [11] is designed to reason about any object that can be graphically represented as an arrow, and has  various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships between these arrows.
In the preference aggregation logic jal(LK ) we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen as arrows.
However , while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity , they can not directly express most of the properties we have
