The power of the quantifier suggests that the complexity of model checking judgment aggregation logic over relatively  succinct representations of JAR is going to be relatively high; we now prove that the complexity of model checking judgment aggregation logic is as hard as solving a polynomial number of np-hard  problems [9, pp.424-429].
For Î”p 2-hardness, we reduce snsat (sequentially nested 2 Of course, we have no general way of checking whether any given Turing machine is guaranteed to terminate in polynomial time; the problem is undecidable.
It follows that this is a rather powerful operator : as we will see
