The higher the amount of overlap, the higher the efficiency of discovery, and the higher the robustness of the overlay to dynamics of peer participations.
PRO uses joint-ranking [15] to determine relative utility of a parent for a receiver.
When a gossip message arrives at each peer , an image maintenance
