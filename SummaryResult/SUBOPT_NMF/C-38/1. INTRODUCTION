PRO consists of two key components: (i) Gossip-based Peer Discovery: Each peer periodically exchanges message (i.e., gossips) with other known peers to progressively learn about a subset of participating peers in the overlay that are likely to be good parents.
Since the available bandwidth from different participating peers to a receiver (and possible  correlation among them) can be measured only at that receiver, a receiver-driven approach is the natural solution to maximize available bandwidth to heterogeneous peers.
Furthermore, having multiple parent peers accommodates bandwidth  heterogeneity and asymmetry while improves resiliency against dynamics of peer participation.
