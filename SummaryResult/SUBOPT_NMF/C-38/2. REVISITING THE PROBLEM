Potentially good parents for a receiver are  identified based on their relative utility for the receiver.
The utility of a parent peer pi for a receiver pj is a function of their relative network distance (delij) and the outgoing  access link bandwidth of the parent (outbwi), (i.e., U(pi, pj) 3 These multi-tree approaches often do not use congestion control for each connection.
This also implies that those solutions that build multi-parent overlay structure but do not explicitly ensure in-time delivery of individual segments (e.g., [3, 11]) may not be able to support streaming applications.
