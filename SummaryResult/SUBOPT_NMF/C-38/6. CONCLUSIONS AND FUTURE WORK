This is a starting point for our work on PRO.
We described the basic framework and its key components, and sketched our  strawman solutions.
We are currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via simulation, and exploring the design space of key  components.
Both peer discovery and peer selection in this framework are scalable.
We are also prototyping this framework to conduct real-world experiments on the Planet-Lab in a near future. 
PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to  maximize its performance.
Furthermore , PRO uses congestion controlled bandwidth as
