Each receiver  selects a random delay proportional to its available bandwidth from the parent peer [8].
This should significantly reduce number of new parent selections, which in turn  improves scalability (by minimizing the interference caused by new connections) and stability of the overlay structure.
This  strategy allows gradual improvement of the parent subset as new peers are discovered (or joined) the overlay.
In PRO, each receiver randomly selects a parent from its current image where the probability of selecting a parent is proportional to its utility.
Finally , if the aggregate bandwidth from all parents remains below the required bandwidth
