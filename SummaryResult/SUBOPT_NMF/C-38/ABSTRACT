Participating peers form an  unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate.
To achieve this goal, PRO adopts a receiver-driven approach where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own  delivered bandwidth.
Furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers.
