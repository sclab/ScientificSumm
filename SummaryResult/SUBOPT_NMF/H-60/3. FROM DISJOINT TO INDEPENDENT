This could be explained by a leverage effect that justifies the binary occurrence and constant containment: The term occurrence for small  documents tends to be larger than for large documents, whereas the containment for small documents tends to be smaller than for large documents.
The upper bound of the independent noise  probability follows from the limit limN→∞(1 + x N )N = ex (see any comprehensive math book, for example, [5], for the  convergence equation of the Euler function).
are ignored, and document containments are considered as  disjoint events.
Pdis (t is noisy|c) = Pfreq (t is noisy|c) Proof.
