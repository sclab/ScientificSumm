We show in section 3.1 that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N used in the classic idf -definition can be explained by three assumptions: binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document containment events.
We use the notion of noisy terms rather than  frequent terms since frequent terms leaves open whether we refer to the document frequency of a term in a collection or to the so-called term frequency (also referred to as  withindocument frequency) of a term in a document.
Let T be the set of terms occurring in a collection.
An explanation might be the
