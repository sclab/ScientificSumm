The limit is close to the actual value for k << N. For large k, the actual value is smaller than the limit.
4.3 Poisson distribution For an infinite number of events, the Poisson probability function is the limit of the binomial probability function.
For independent documents, the Poisson distribution  approximates the probability of the disjunction for large n(t), since the independent term noise probability is equal to the sum over the binomial probabilities where at least one of n(t) document containment events is true.
For example, consider the eight possible worlds for three documents (N = 3).
