[7] and [6] address the deviation of idf and Poisson, and apply Poisson mixtures to achieve better Poisson-based  estimates.
The Pareto distribution is the continuous case of the Lotka and Lotka and Zipf show equivalences.
This motivation matches the motivation of our paper: We investigate theoretically the assumptions of classical idf and Poisson for a better understanding of parameter estimation and combination. 
The Poisson model was here applied to the term frequency of a term in a document.
[11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability  estimation to information theory.
Our discussion of the Poisson distribution focuses on the
