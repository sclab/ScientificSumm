By changing the parameter p := λ/N of the independence  probability, we can lift or lower the independence curve.

The probability functions  displayed are summarised in figure 2 where the simplified  Poisson is used in the noise and informativeness graphs.
The frequency-based probability can be explained by binary occurrence, constant containment and disjointness of documents.
This theoretical result explains why experimental  investigations on Poisson (see [7]) show that a Poisson estimation does work better for frequent (bad, noisy) terms than for rare (good, informative) terms.
This radical behaviour can be smoothened by using
