Often, optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also Nash equilibrium strategies (for example, in two-player zero-sum games this is always true), although this is not always the case (for example, as we already pointed out, sometimes the optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated  strategy, which can never be a Nash equilibrium strategy).
