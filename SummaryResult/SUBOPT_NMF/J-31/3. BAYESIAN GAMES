Then, the leader can commit to a pure strategy such that for each vertex v in the cover, the leader plays sv for some type.
We will  exhibit NP-hardness by reducing from the  INDEPENDENTSET problem.
The leader has only a single type, and for every vertex v ∈ V , the leader has an action sv.
In 2-player Bayesian games in which the leader has only a single type, an optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found in O(#outcomes · #types) time.
The utility function for the leader is given by , for all θl ∈ Θl and
