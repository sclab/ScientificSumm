Nevertheless, the program must be feasible for at least some follower strategies; among these follower strategies, choose a strategy tâˆ— that maximizes the linear program"s solution value.
Theorem 3.
Writing the objective of the linear program as maximize i cixi, for any i, let ul(i, 0) = ci and uf (i, 0) = 0.
We note that arg max is set-valued.
We now show that the reduction works in general.
For every pure follower strategy t , we compute a mixed strategy for the leader such that 1 ) playing t is a best response for the follower ,
