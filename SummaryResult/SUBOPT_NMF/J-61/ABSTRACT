All computation in the exchange is carefully  optimized to exploit the structure of the bid-trees and to avoid enumerating trades.
A proxied interpretation of a  revealedpreference activity rule ensures progress across rounds.
The exchange is fully implemented and in a validation phase.
A VCG-based payment scheme that has been shown to  mitigate opportunities for bargaining and strategic behavior is used to determine final payments.
These bounds allow price discovery and useful preference elicitation in early rounds, and allow termination with an efficient trade despite partial information on bidder valuations.
Bidders specify lower and upper bounds on their value for different
