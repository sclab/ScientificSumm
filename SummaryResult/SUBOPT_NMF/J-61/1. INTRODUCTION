This paper presents the first design for an iterative  combinatorial exchange (ICE).
Thus, unlike a DA, a CE allows all participants to express complex valuations via expressive bids.
The genesis of this project was a class, CS 286r Topics at the Interface between Economics and Computer Science, taught at Harvard University in Spring 2004.1 The entire class was dedicated to the design and prototyping of an iterative CE.
The exchange has a number of interesting theoretical  properties.
In describing the exchange we will first provide an overview of the main components and introduce several working examples.
