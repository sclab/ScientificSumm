For sufficiency, notice that the difference in  payoff between trade L∗ i and another trade λi is unaffected by the way uncertainty is resolved on any node that is satisfied in both L∗ i and λi.
Fixing the values in ˜vi on nodes satisfied in L∗ i has the effect of removing this consideration when a trade U∗ i is selected that satisfies one of these nodes.
But, valuation vi ∈ Ti together with L∗ i presents a  counterexample to RP (Eq.
Proposition 1.
Example 8 helps to illustrate this.
