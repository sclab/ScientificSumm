The exchange is fully implemented in Java and is in a validation phase.
The next steps for our work are to allow bidders to refine the structure of the bid tree in addition to values on the tree.
In addition, we are beginning to engage in collaborations to apply the design to airline takeoff and landing slot scheduling and to resource allocation in  widearea network distributed computational systems.
Acknowledgments We would like to dedicate this paper to all of the participants in CS 286r at Harvard University in Spring 2004.
