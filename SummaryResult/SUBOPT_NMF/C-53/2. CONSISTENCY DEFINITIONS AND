Due to network transmission delay, it is difficult to maintain the states of shared entities absolutely consistent.
If De(i, j, t) > De(l, k, t), it can be stated that, at time point t, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. Similarly, De(i, j, t1, t2) can been used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency in a certain time period.
Corresponding metrics are needed to measure the consistency of shared entities between local and remote sites.
If De ( i
