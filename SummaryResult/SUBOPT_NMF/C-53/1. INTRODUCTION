In order to tackle the inconsistency caused by exceptional network transmission delay, a time warp based mechanism is proposed to repair the state.
In addition to the high fidelity model that maintains the accurate states of its own entities, each site also has a DR model that estimates the states of all entities (including its own entities).
Due to network transmission delay, when a remote site receives a state update of an entity the state of the entity might have changed at the site sending the state update.
In replication based games , network transmission delay makes the states of
