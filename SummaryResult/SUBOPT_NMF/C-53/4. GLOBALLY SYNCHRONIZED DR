To GS-DR-LL, the selection of lag value n is very important, and both network transmission delay and the effects of local lag on interaction should be considered.
For example, in a graphical user interface a delay of approximately 150 ms cannot be noticed for keyboard interaction and the threshold increases to 195 ms for mouse interaction [13], and a delay of up to 50 ms is uncritical for a car-racing game [5].
Note that the timestamp of the sent state update is t. After that , local site uses Sreal to update local scene and deletes the operations ,
