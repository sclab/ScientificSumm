4 The 5th Workshop on Network & System Support for Games 2006 - NETGAMES 2006 According to the prediction and state filtering mechanisms of DR, inconsistency cannot be completely eliminated if the threshold is not 0.
Additionally, inconsistency increases with the network transmission delay, but decreases with the threshold.
In one category, the lag was fixed at 300 ms and three different network transmission delays (100 ms, 300 ms, and 500 ms) were used.
