With the help of global synchronization, DR can achieve higher consistency, but it still cannot eliminate before inconsistency.
In this paper, a method named Globally Synchronized DR with Local Lag (GS-DR-LL), which combines local lag and Globally Synchronized DR (GS-DR), is presented.
Performance evaluation shows that GS-DR-LL can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.

However, DR cannot maintain high consistency, and this constrains its application in highly interactive games.
Since DR can filter most unnecessary state updates
