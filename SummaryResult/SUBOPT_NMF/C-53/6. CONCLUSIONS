highly interactive games).
Performance evaluation indicates that GS-DR-LL can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.
As a result, the application of DR can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems which request high consistency (e.g.
GS-DR-LL has significant implications to consistency maintenance approaches.
First, GS-DR-LL shows that improved DR can not only eliminate after inconsistency but also decrease 6 The 5th Workshop on Network & System Support for Games 2006 - NETGAMES 2006 before inconsistency, with proper lag and threshold, it would even eliminate before inconsistency.
In this paper , we proposed a
