This dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions, which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and  improves the precision at the same time.
First, based on statistical language modeling, we perform context  sensitive analysis on the query side.
We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine.
Two unique  properties make our approach feasible for Web Search.
Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants.
This conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming , and it
