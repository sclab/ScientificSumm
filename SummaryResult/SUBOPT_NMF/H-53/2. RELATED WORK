To  decide which expanded words to use, people often use  pseudorelevance feedback techniquesthat send the original query to a search engine and retrieve the top documents, extract  relevant words from these top documents as additional query words, and resubmit the expanded query again [21].
A more general problem related to stemming is query reformulation [3, 12] and query expansion which expands words not only with word variants [7, 22, 24, 25].
However, due to the limited number of tested queries (less than 100) and the small size of the collection, the results are hard to generalize to Web search.
