This model makes the same stemming as the naive model on the query side, but performs  conservative matching on the document side using the strategy described in section 3.5.
We then further improve the document sensitive matching model from the query side with selective word stemming based on statistical language modeling (section 3.4), referred as  selective stemming model.
The reason that it improves short queries is that most short queries only have one word that can be stemmed.
Thus, blindly pluralizing short queries is  relatively safe.
Then we improve the naive stemming model by document sensitive matching , referred as
