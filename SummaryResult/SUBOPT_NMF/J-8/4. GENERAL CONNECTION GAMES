ti, to the sink of G, i.e.
t. Then Q = ¯Qi ∪ Q is a path from the source s to the sink t. For any player j < i, let yj be the intersecting vertex of Q and tj (by Lemma 2.1 one is guarantee to exist).
ci(p), contradicting the fact that player i improved his cost.
, pn) be a strong equilibrium, and let T∗ be the minimum cost Steiner tree on all players, rooted at the (single) source s. Let T∗ e be the subtree of T∗ disconnected from s when edge e is removed.
This will contradict
