• Identification: The identification operation allows to collapse two nodes to one.
Let Gp = (V, Ep) denote the graph bought by the players for profile p = (p1, .
Given a joint action, the cost of a player is the sum of his costs on the edges it selected.
Resilience to coalitions: A pure deviation of a set of  players Γ ⊂ N (also called coalition) specifies an action for each player in the coalition, i.e., γ ∈ ×i∈ΓΣi.
More formally , given graph G = ( V , E ) we define the identification of a node v1 ∈ V and
