We define an order on the players as follows.
Let ne(S(Γ)) denote the load of edge e under the profile S(Γ) in the game Λ(Γ), i.e., ne(S(Γ)) = |{j|j ∈ Γ, e ∈ Sj}|.
For each k = 8 We can show that this is the unique NE by a simple case analysis: (i) If S1 = {h, f, d} and S2 = {h, f, e}, then player 1 can deviate to S1 = {h, g} and decrease his cost.
S1 = { a , b , c } , 7 In any NE of the game , player
