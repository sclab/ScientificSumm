(2) For a single source multiple sinks we show that for a series parallel graph a strong equilibrium always exists (both for fair and general connection games).
(3) For multi source and sink we show that an extension parallel graph always admits a strong equilibrium in fair connection games.
Our main existence results are the following: (1) For a single source and sink we show that there is always a strong equilibrium (both for fair and general connection games).
As for the quality of the strong equilibrium we show that in any fair connection games the cost of a strong
