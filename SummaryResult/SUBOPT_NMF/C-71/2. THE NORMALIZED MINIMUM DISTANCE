If the sensor  coverage model is the Boolean coverage model [15][17][18][14] and the coverage radius of each node is the same.
ι is a very interesting value of a set of points.
It is exciting to see that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi diagram [2] formed by these nodes (A Vonoroi diagram formed by a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node) is a honeycomb-like structure1 .
ι is the minimum distance between each pair of
