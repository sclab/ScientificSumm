We set out to validate this idea by employing ι to a  sensorgrouping problem.
We formulate a general sensor-grouping  problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.
With an  algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND), we show that maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good approach to solve this  problem.
We propose that ι can serve as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points, which can be employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
Simulation results verify that MIND outperforms a greedy algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we design in terms of the number and
