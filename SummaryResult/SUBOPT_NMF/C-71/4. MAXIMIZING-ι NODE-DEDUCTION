It  calculates the resulting group sensing neighbors of it based on the above procedure.
The node is grouped to the first group.
4.2 Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm: A Benchmark for MIND To evaluate the effectiveness of introducing Î¹ in the sensor-group problem, another algorithm for sensor-group problem called  Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) is designed.
Then all the ungrouped sensing neighbors that are not deleted are grouped into the same group of node i.
It is a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution of Problem 1.
( i.e. , the coverage quality requirement of the parts is not
