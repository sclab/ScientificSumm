We call this circular area the sensing area of a node.
• R: The sensing radius of a sensor node.
Given: • The set of each sensor node i"s sensing neighbors N(i) and the location of each member in N(i); • A sensing model which quantitatively describes how a point P in area φ is covered by sensor nodes that are responsible to monitor this point.
• n: The number in-network sensor nodes.
That is to say, nodes should determine which group they should join in a fully  distributed way.
We assume that the communication range
