To explore the effectiveness of employing ι in coverage-related problems, we formulate a  sensorgrouping problem for high-redundancy WSNs.
Employing ι in coverage-related problems is thus deemed promising.
Second, we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.
With the MIND algorithm we show that locally maximizing ι among each sensor node and its neighbors is a good approach to solve this problem.
It is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be working in sleeping mode ( i.e. , major power-consuming units such as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be
