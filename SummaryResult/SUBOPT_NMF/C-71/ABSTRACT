To validate this idea, we formulate a general  sensorgrouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.
We propose that ι can serve as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points, which can be  employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
We show that locally maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good  approach to solve this problem with an algorithm called  Maximizingι Node-Deduction (MIND).
Simulation results verify that MIND outperforms a greedy algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we design.
This demonstrates a good application of employing ι in coverage-related problems for WSNs.
