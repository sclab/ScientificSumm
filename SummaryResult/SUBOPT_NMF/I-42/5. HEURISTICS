Note that in this  algorithm each node only exchanges its best value with its neighbors.
A general distributed best-first  algorithm for node expansion is presented in Algorithm 2.
Assuming a complexity of O(V ) for the evaluation function, which is the case for our best  overall function, the best-first traversal is O(V · E) which is at worst O(n3 ).
After all heuristics have had a chance to complete, every node knows which heuristic produced the best pseudotree.
