This hypercube has dimensional size equal to the number of pseudo-parents plus one.
At this point all utilities involving node Y are known, and the domain for Y may be safely eliminated from the joined hypercube.
Since Z has no parents or pseudo-parents, it simply combines the utility hypercubes  received from its children.
Each other node then receives a value propagation message from its parent and chooses the assignment for its domain that has the best utility given the assignments received in the  message.
3.1 Utility Propagation Agents located at leaf nodes in the pseudotree begin the process by calculating
