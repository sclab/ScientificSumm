Thus the DCPOP algorithm using a traditional pseudotree sends only utility propagation messages that contain domains  belonging to the parent or pseudo-parents of a node.
The local utility hypercube at X contains domains for X, P(X), PP(X), and BC(X).
In DCPOP this message contains dimensions for the domains of P(X) and PP(X).
When a node Y receives utility propagation messages from all of The Sixth Intl.
The first comes from node C and includes dimensions for domains E, B, and A.
Also , since X is not a merge point , all assignments to BC
