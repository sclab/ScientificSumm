In both Table 1 and Table 2 we have listed performance  metrics for the original DPOP algorithm, the DCPOP algorithm using only cross-edged pseudotrees (DCPOP-CE), and the DCPOP  algorithm using traditional and cross-edged pseudotrees (DCPOP-All).
The pseudotrees used for DPOP were generated using 5  heuristics: DFS, DFS MCN, DFS CLIQUE MCN, DFS MCN DSTB, and DFS MCN BEC.
The last three columns show the same metrics we used for the generic DCOP instances, except this time we only show the improvements of DCPOP-All over DPOP.
For the PC metric the value shown is a percentage reduction in the maximum sequential
