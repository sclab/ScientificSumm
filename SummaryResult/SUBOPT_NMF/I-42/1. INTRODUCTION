We began to  investigate the performance of traditional pseudotrees generated by  current edge-traversal heuristics.
It has been shown in [6] that any constraint graph can be mapped into a traditional pseudotree.
Instead of finding an assignment that satisfies all constraints, these approaches find an assignment that produces a high level of global utility.
Early domains for  distributed constraint satisfaction problems (DisCSP) included job shop scheduling [1] and resource allocation [2].
In this paper we introduce an extension to the DPOP algorithm that handles an extended set of pseudotree arrangements which include cross-edged pseudotrees.
We found that these heuristics often produced
