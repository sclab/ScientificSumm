We acknowledge that pseudotree  arrangements that allow parent-child relationships without an actual  constraint can solve the problem in Figure 3(a) with maximum  computation size of four domains.
In Figure 3(a) we have a DCOP instance with six nodes.
We also see that no node can have more than one child because any such arrangement would be an invalid pseudotree.
Since no better traditional pseudotree arrangement can be  created using an edge-traversal heuristic, we have shown that DCPOP can outperform DPOP even if we use the optimal pseudotree found through edge-traversal.
