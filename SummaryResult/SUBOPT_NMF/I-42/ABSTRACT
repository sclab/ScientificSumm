We introduce an extension to the DPOP algorithm that handles an extended set of pseudotree arrangements.

Our  algorithm correctly solves DCOP instances for pseudotrees that  include edges between nodes in separate branches.
We prove that for some  problem instances it is not possible to generate a traditional pseudotree using edge-traversal heuristics that will outperform a cross-edged pseudotree.
The algorithm also solves instances with traditional pseudotree arrangements  using the same procedure as DPOP.
We use multiple heuristics to generate pseudotrees and choose the best pseudotree in linear
