Solid line edges  represent parent-child relationships and the dashed line represents a pseudo-parent-pseudo-child relationship.
The bolded node, B, is the merge point for node E. 2.2 Cross-edged Pseudotrees We define a cross-edge as an edge from node X to a node Y that is above X but not in the path from X to the root.
Figure 1 shows a pseudotree with four nodes, three edges (A-B, B-C,  BD), and one back-edge (A-C).
First , the DCOP instance < X , D , U > translates directly into a graph with X as the set of vertices and an edge
