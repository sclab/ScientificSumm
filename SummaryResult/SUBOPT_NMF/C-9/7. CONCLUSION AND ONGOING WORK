As described we have already an early implementation of the framework for the decentralized adaptive services.
In a next step the resource management will be integrate in an already implemented prototype of the EDAS  architecture.
This framework has to be extended to smoothly interact with the resource management and the EDAS architecture.
In a final step we need to implement some services that verify the usability of the whole EDAS project. 
For both problems we offer a solution, a currently  implemented simulation environment will verify their feasibility.
As described the resource management can be decomposed in two main problems that
