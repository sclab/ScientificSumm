webserver, source-code repository etc.).
It aims at supporting the autonomous execution and  evolution of services in terms of scalability and resource-aware distribution.
The environment for decentralized adaptive services (EDAS) provides a grid-like infrastructure for user-accessed,  longterm services (e.g.
EDAS offers flexible service models based on distributed mobile objects ranging from a traditional  clientserver scenario to a fully peer-to-peer based approach.
Automatic, dynamic resource management allows optimized use of available resources while minimizing the administrative complexity.
