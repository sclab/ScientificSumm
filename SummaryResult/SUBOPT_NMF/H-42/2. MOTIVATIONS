It turns out that the obvious symmetry implied by the above formulation of the hypotheses is a property worth investigating, and the investigation does indeed give us valuable insights. 
We seek methods of building and analysing a matrix of system-topic normalised performances, with a view to giving insight into the issue and confirming or  refuting the third and fourth hypotheses.
However, in the present paper, we seek instead to explore the  relationships suggested by the hypotheses, between what different topics tell us about systems and what different systems tell us about topics.
One possible direction from this point would be
