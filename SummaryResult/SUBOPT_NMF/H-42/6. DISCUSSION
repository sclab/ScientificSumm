This is left for future work. 
However, they reveal that the method of analysis proposed in this paper can provide valuable information.
It is easy to derive that : AAT [ i , j ] = 8 > < > : 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i ∈ T ∧ j ∈ S P k A [ i , k ] · A [ j , k ] otherwise AT A [ i , j ] = 8 > < > : 0  if i ∈ S ∧ j ∈ T or i
