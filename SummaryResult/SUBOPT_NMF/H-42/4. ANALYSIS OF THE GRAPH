3): h = Aa and a = AT h (7) (where h is the hubness vector, with the hub values for all the nodes; a is the authority vector; A is the adjacency  matrix of the graph; and AT its transpose).
2c we can state that: â€¢ Authority a(t) of a topic node t increases when: - if h(si) > 0, APM(si, t) increases (or if APM(si, t) > 0, h(si) increases); - if h(si) < 0, APM(si, t) decreases (or if APM(si, t) < 0, h(si) decreases).
In fact the entire HITS analysis could be done in one
