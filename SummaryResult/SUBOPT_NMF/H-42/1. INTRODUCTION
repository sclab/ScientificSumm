Several extensions to these algorithms have been and are being  proposed.
In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method for constructing a network, specifically a weighted complete bidirectional directed bipartite graph, on a set of TREC  topics and participating systems.
Of  particular importance is Social Network Analysis [16], that studies networks made up by links among humans (friendship,  acquaintance, co-authorship, bibliographic citation, etc.).
3 presents the basic ideas of normalizing average precision and of constructing a  systemstopics graph, whose properties are analyzed in Sect.
Some indicators ( and the corresponding algorithms that compute them ) have been found useful
