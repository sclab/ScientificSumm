This, given the meaning of hubness (capability in estimating topic ease and system effectiveness), means two things: (i) more  effective systems are better at estimating topic ease; and (ii) easier topics are better at estimating system effectiveness.
To use GMAP in place of MAP and AAP, we only need to take the logarithms of initial AP values, i.e., those in Tab.
GMAP has the property of giving more weight to the low end of the AP scale ( i.e. , to low AP values ) , and this seems reasonable , since , intuitively , a performance increase in MAP
