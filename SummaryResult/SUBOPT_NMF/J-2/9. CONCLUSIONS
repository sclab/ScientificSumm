We then provided an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and showed how to cast this model as a linear  program.
The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case.
Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on  designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents" preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).
