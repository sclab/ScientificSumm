, am wins a unit, and pays ˆvm+1 for this unit.
Let the set of agents be {a1, a2, .
After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribution payment.
Thus, the total VCG payment equals mˆvm+1.
Let vi denote the true value of ai.
Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.
( This assumption is not harmful : in environments where anyone can join the auction , running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway , because everyone would want to join
