Thus, the total redistribution payment is (n − j)tj.
So tj = 0 (j ≤ m < n).
, 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. Claim 6. f satisfies the following inequalities: ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m + i)tm+i−1 + (n − m − i)tm+i ≤ m for i = 2, 3, .
If j > m, the property is satisfied.
If tn−1 = 0, consider the bid vector where everyone bids 1.
Here, each agent receives a redistribution payment f(0, 0, .
, xn−1 ) = 0 for all
