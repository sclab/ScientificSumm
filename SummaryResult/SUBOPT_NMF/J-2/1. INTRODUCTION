Suppose the agents are trying to  distribute some resources among themselves that do not have a previous owner.
Unfortunately, in general settings, it is in fact impossible to design mechanisms that satisfy budget balance in addition to the other desirable properties [16, 11, 21].
One way of trying to  design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the agents" incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained), and that will maintain the other properties.
For example , in a single-item auction ( where the VCG mechanism
