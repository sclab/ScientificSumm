All mechanisms in the family are efficient,  strategyproof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit.
We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and show how to cast this model as a linear program.
If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus  payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer.
The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case.
We give both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program , and the ( unique )
