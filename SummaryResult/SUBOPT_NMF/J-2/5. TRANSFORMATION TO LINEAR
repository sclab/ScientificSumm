The individual rationality constraint can be  written as zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + .
, n. Because ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to qm+1ˆvm+1 + qm+2ˆvm+2 + .
+ qnˆvn ≥ 0 qm+1 = m − (n − m − 1)cm+1 qi = −(i−1)ci−1 −(n−i)ci, for i = m+2, .
We have already shown that ci = 0 for i ≤ m. Thus , the above
