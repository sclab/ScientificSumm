Then, consider the bid vector that results from replacing ˆvj by ˆvj+1 for all j ≥ i, and letting ˆvn = 0.
Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any bid vector, zn ≥ 0.
Under this mechanism, each agent receives a  redistribution payment of m n times the (m+1)th highest bid from another agent.
If the ci have this property, then it actually follows that zi is nonnegative for every i, for the following reason.
, am+1 receive a redistribution payment of m n ˆvm+2, and the others receive m n ˆvm+1.
An agent that does
