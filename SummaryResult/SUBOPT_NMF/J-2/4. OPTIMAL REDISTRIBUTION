It turns out that there is no  mechanism in the family that dominates all other mechanisms in the family.
So in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+2 = 0, the percentage  redistributed is n−m−1 n .
, ˆvn), where P is a 2 The percentage redistributed seems the natural criterion to use, among other things because it is scale-invariant: if we multiply all bids by the same positive constant (for example, if we change the units by re-expressing the bids in euros instead of dollars), we would not want the behavior of our mechanism to change.
For the second example , the
