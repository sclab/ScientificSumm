Suppose the bid values are drawn from a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
When n > m + 2, the worst-case  optimal mechanism outperforms the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case). 
For the single-unit case, this simplifies to 2 n ˆv3 + n−2 n ˆv2.
Hence the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed is ˆv2− 2 n ˆv3− n−2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 , which has an expected value of E( 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 ) = 2 n − 2 n E ˆv3 ˆv2 .
