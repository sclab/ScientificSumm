The findings (ranked in descending order based on effect size), show that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: • Revisit pages in the trail less often (d = .45) • Spend less time traversing each search trail (d = .38) • Spend less time viewing each document (d = .28) • Branch (i.e., proceed to new pages following a back operation) less often (d = .18) • Follow search trails with fewer steps (d = .16) It seems that advanced users use a more directed searching style than non-advanced users.
