Circled points represent the tradeoffs obtained by resampling feedback for α = 0.5.
We call this the ‘small-α" strategy.
In the figure, the curve for each topic set interpolates between trade-off points, beginning at x=0, where α = 0.5, and continuing in the direction of the arrow as α decreases and the original query is given more and more weight.
