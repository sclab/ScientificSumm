Next, a single feedback model vector is computed according to some sort of average,  centroid, or expectation over the set of possibly-relevant  document models.
Our main hypothesis in this paper is that estimating the uncertainty in feedback is useful and leads to better  individual feedback models and more robust combined models.
We also perform model combination using several improved feedback language models obtained by a small number of new queries sampled from the original query.
The use of an expectation is reasonable for practical and theoretical reasons , but by itself ignores potentially valuable information about the risk of the
