[17] proposed an approach to improving the robustness of pseudo-relevance feedback using a method they call selective sampling.
The essence of their method is that they allow skipping of some top-ranked documents, based on a clustering criterion, in order to select a more  varied and novel set of documents later in the ranking for use by a traditional pseudo-feedback method.
[11] used  queryspecific variance estimates of classifier outputs to perform improved model combination.
The idea of examining the overlap between lists of  suggested terms has also been used in early query expansion approaches.
Principal component analysis ( PCA ) is
