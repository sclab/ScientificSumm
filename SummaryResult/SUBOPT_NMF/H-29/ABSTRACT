We then perform model combination over several enhanced models, each based on a slightly modified query sampled from the original query.
Treating the baseline feedback method as a black box, and the output feedback model as a random variable, we estimate a posterior distribution for the  feedback model by resampling a given query"s top-retrieved  documents, using the posterior mean or mode as the enhanced feedback model.
We find that resampling documents helps increase individual feedback model precision by removing noise terms , while sampling from the query improves robustness ( worst-case performance ) by emphasizing terms related to
