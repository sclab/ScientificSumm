Observation 1.

would be cost[i] = α[i] · b[i], where i = pos(b).
The  resulting spend and traffic are given by spend(A)=Ea∼A[spend(a)]; traffic(A)=Ea∼A[traffic(a)] We can now state the problem in its full generality: Budget Optimization Input: a budget U, a keyword-query graph G = (K ∪ Q, E), and landscapes (costq(·), clicksq(·)) for each q ∈ Q.
We model the keyword interaction problem using an undirected bipartite graph G = ( K ∪ Q , E ) where K is a set of keywords and
