To see this, consider two consecutive positions i,i + 1.
The slope of line segment between the points corresponding to those two positions is cost(b[i]) − cost(b[i + 1]) clicks(b[i]) − clicks(b[i + 1]) = (α[i] − α[i + 1]) · b[i] α[i] − α[i + 1] = b[i].
For a full definition of VCG and its application to  sponsored search we refer the reader to [1, 2, 5].
We claim that in the VCG auction, the landscapes are  convex.
Now consider running the algorithm described in Section 2.1.4 for finding the
