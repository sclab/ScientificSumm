In the LP, she is actually going to  compute a distribution over pairs of strategies in S, which we will then interpret as a distribution over strategies.
Using this set of uniform strategies as constraints , we can characterize a set of worst-case click-price curves by the constraints Z CΩ 0 h ( r ) dr ≤ U ∀ ( u , v ) ∈ S p1 ( u , v ) uh ( u ) + p2 ( u , v ) vh ( v ) ≥ U A curve h that satisfies these constraints has the property that
