Furthermore, this strategy will always be a two-bid strategy.
One could also use an ad scheduling tool offered by some search companies8 to implement this strategy.
The best single-bid strategy can also be computed easily from the aggregate landscape.
The resulting strategy is the convex combination of two points on the aggregate landscape.
Putting these ideas together, we get an O(N log N)-time algorithm for Budget Optimization, where N is the total number of landscape points (we later show that this is a (1 âˆ’ 1 e )-approximation algorithm): 1.
We can index the points in I as
