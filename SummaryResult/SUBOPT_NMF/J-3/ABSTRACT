While most variants are NP-hard, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that simply randomizing between two uniform strategies that bid equally on all the keywords works well.
More precisely, this strategy gets at least a 1 âˆ’ 1/e fraction of the maximum clicks possible.
In this work, we focus on the advertisers, who must solve a complex optimization problem to decide how to place bids on  keywords to maximize their return (the number of user clicks on their ads) for a given budget.
We model the entire process and study this budget optimization problem.
As our preliminary experiments show , such uniform
