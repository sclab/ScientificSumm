A current node runs on 4 AA batteries for about 12 hours of continuous operation.
An analog trigger circuit could solve this problem, however, the system would miss the first shot.
Second, the performance of the system when used in  standalone mode, that is, when single sensors alone provided localization, was also very good.
The key factor behind this is the sensor fusion algorithm"s ability to reject erroneous measurements.
However, important aspects of the system would still need to be worked on.
A deployable version of the sensor node would need to be asleep during normal operation and
