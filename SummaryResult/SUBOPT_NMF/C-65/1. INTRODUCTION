Depending on the operation, the deployment may be needed for an hour or a month, but eventually the area looses its importance.
While there are  vehiclemounted countersniper systems [1] available commercially, we are not aware of a deployed system that protects  dismounted soldiers.
The acoustic sensors measure the Time of Arrival (ToA) of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves, pressure waves induced by the supersonic projectile, send the data to a base station where a sensor fusion algorithm determines the origin of the shot.
The paper presents the design and evaluation of our  soldierwearable mobile countersniper system.
Once the sensors are
