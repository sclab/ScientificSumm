The motes are equipped with IEEE 802.15.4  compliant radio transceivers and support ad-hoc wireless  networking among the nodes and to/from the base station.
We used a quad pack of rechargeable AA batteries as the power source (although any other configuration is viable that meets the voltage requirements).
An RS232 port and a Bluetooth (BlueGiga WT12) wireless link with virtual UART emulation are directly available on the board and provide simple means to connect the sensor to PCs and PDAs.
The board supports four independent analog channels  sampled at up to 1 MS/s (million samples per seconds).
The board utilizes a
