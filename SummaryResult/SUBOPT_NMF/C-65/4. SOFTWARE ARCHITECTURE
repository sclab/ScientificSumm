The higher level protocols on these lines are implemented by Xilinx PicoBlaze microcontroller cores [13] and corresponding software programs.
The control, status and data registers of the UART modules are available through the register file.
These time stamps and all other timing information (parameters, acoustic event features) are based on a 1 MHz clock and an internal timer on the FPGA.
The USB module  implements a simple FIFO with parallel data lines connected to an external FT245R USB device controller.
Each of the analog channels is driven by a serial A/D core for providing a 20 MHz serial clock and
