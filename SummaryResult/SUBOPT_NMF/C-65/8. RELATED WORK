An extensive test has been conducted to measure the performance of both type of systems.
The soldier-worn system has 12 microphones as well as a GPS antenna and orientation  sensors mounted on a helmet.
Note that BBN"s current vehicle-mounted system called BOOMERANG, a modified version of Bullet Ears, is currently used in Iraq [1].
Joint time-frequency (JTF) spectrograms are used to analyze the typical separation of the shockwave and  muzzle blast transients in both time and frequency.
The focus is on the robust detection and length estimation of small caliber acoustic shockwaves and  muzzle blasts.
There is a
