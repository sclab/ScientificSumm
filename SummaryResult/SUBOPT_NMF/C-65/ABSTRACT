The paper presents the system design and the results from an independent evaluation at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center.
The system  estimates the trajectory, the range, the caliber and the weapon type.
The heterogeneous sensor fusion algorithm can work with data from a single sensor or it can fuse ToA or Angle of Arrival (AoA) observations of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves from multiple sensors.
The system performance is characterized by  1degree trajectory precision and over 95% caliber estimation accuracy for all shots, and close to 100% weapon estimation accuracy for 4 out of 6 guns tested.
