For any given 3D box, this function gives the number of measurements supporting the hypothesis that the shooter was within that box.
The search starts with a box large enough to contain the whole area of interest, then zooms in by dividing and evaluating boxes.

If one sensor has  multiple ToA detections, we use the average of those times, so one sensor supplies at most one ToA estimate.
