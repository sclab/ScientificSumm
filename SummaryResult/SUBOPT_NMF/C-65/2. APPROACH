In fact, an infinite number of trajectory-bullet speed pairs satisfy the observations.
If at least three acoustic channels detect the same event, its AoA is also computed.
A hybrid sensor fusion algorithm then estimates the trajectory, the range, the caliber and the weapon type based on all available observations.
It is typically a few hundred Î¼sec.
Also, this method does not estimate a trajectory.
The board detects shockwaves and muzzle blasts and measures their ToA.
The sensorboard is also Bluetooth capable for  communication with the soldier"s PDA or laptop computer.
As the microphones are close to each other
