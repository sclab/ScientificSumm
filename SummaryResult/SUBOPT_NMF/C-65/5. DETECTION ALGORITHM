The latter one is essential to adapt the sensor to different ambient noise environments and to temporarily suspend the muzzle blast detector after a shock wave event (oscillations in the analog section or reverberations in the sensor enclosure might  otherwise trigger false muzzle blast detections).
Therefore, the real challenge for the matching detection core is to identify the first and second half periods properly.
The shockwave detection core is continuously looking for two rising edges within a given interval.
The functional equivalence between the two implementations were tested by VHDL test benches and Python scripts which provided an automated way
