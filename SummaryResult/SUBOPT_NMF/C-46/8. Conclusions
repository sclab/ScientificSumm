At the proxy tier, TSAR employs a novel multi-resolution ordered distributed index structure, the Sparse  Interval Skip Graph, for efficiently supporting spatio-temporal and range queries.
We presented the design of TSAR, a fundamentally different storage architecture that envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local storage at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
At the sensor tier, TSAR supports energy-aware adaptive summarization that can trade-off the energy cost of  transmitting metadata to the proxies against the overhead of false hits  resulting from querying a coarser resolution index structure.
In this paper , we argued that existing sensor
