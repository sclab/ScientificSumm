Our prototype employs the MultiHopLEPSM routing protocol with the BMAC layer configured in the low-power mode with a 11% duty cycle (one of the default BMAC [22] parameters) Our TSAR implementation on the Mote involves a data  gathering task that periodically obtains sensor readings and logs these reading to flash memory.
The sensor updates are used to construct a sparse interval skip graph that is distributed across proxies, via network messages between proxies over the 802.11b wireless network.
Since sensor nodes may be several hops away from the nearest proxy , the sensor tier employs multi-hop routing to communicate with
