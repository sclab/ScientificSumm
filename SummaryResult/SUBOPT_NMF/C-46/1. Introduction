This index provides a unified, logical view of the distributed data, and enables an application to query and read past data efficiently - the index is used to  pinpoint all data that match a read request, followed by messages to retrieve that data from the corresponding sensors.
We believe that a fundamentally different storage architecture is necessary to address the multi-tier nature of future sensor networks.
This separation of data, which is stored at the sensors, and the metadata, which is stored at the proxies, enables TSAR to reduce energy overheads at the sensors, by leveraging resources at tethered proxies.
