At the proxy tier, TSAR employs a novel multi-resolution ordered distributed index structure, the Interval Skip Graph, for efficiently supporting spatio-temporal and value queries.
We present TSAR, a fundamentally different storage architecture that  envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local archiving at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
Our experiments demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of using our energy-efficient storage architecture in multi-tier sensor networks.
At the sensor tier , TSAR supports energy-aware adaptive summarization that can trade off the cost of transmitting metadata to the proxies against the overhead of false hits resulting from querying
