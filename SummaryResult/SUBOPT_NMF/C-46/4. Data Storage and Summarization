Consequently, TSAR sensors do not maintain any index for the data stored in their archive.
The mechanism works as follows: In addition to the summary of sensor data, each node sends metadata to the proxy containing the time interval corresponding to the summary, as well as the start and end offsets of the flash memory location where the raw data corresponding is stored (as shown in Figure 7).
4.2 Adaptive Summarization The data summaries serve as glue between the storage at the  remote sensor and the index at the proxy.
When older data is overwritten , a delete operation is
