6.4 Adaptive Summarization When data is summarized by the sensor before being reported to the proxy, information is lost.
Each summary represents a collection of records in flash memory, and all of these records need to be retrieved and processed if that  summary matches a query.
As the data retrieved by a query is increased, the latency increases in steps, where each step denotes the overhead of an additional packet.
Figure 11(b) provides a breakdown of the various components of the end-to-end latency.
