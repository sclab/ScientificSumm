Sources publish the events that they detect, and sinks with interest in specific events can subscribe to these events.
In addition to storage and indexing techniques specific to sensor networks, many distributed, peer-to-peer and spatio-temporal index structures are relevant to our work.
Thus complex operations such as indexing and managing metadata are performed at the proxies, while storage at the sensor remains simple.
In order to efficiently access a distributed sensor store, an index needs to be constructed of the data.
Both these systems focus on local storage , whereas our focus is both on storage at the remote sensors
