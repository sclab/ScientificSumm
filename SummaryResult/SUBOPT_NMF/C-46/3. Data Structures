If as in TSAR the number of nodes (proxies) is much smaller than the number of data  elements (data summaries indexed), then this will result in significant savings.
In addition, since both congestion and failure occur on a per-node basis, we may eliminate links without adverse consequences if those links only contribute to load distribution and/or resiliency within a  single node.
The number of  intervals that match a range query can vary depending on the amount of overlap in the intervals being indexed, as well as the range specified in the query.
It may be easily seen that in the
