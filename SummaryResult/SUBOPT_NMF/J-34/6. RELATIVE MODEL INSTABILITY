After the first 2n orders there are still no executions; however, the books are  different.
The sequence Σ is composed from n buy orders with ∆ = 0, followed by n sell orders with ∆ = 0, and finally an alternating sequence of buy orders with ∆ = +1 and sell orders with ∆ = −1 of length 2n.
The next theorem shows that the spread-based stability results of Section 5.1 do not also hold in the relative model.
At the beginning the sell book contains only two prices which are far apart and both contain only two orders , now several buy orders
