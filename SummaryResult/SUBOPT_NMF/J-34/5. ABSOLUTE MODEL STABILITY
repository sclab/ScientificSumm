Here we use the fact that the bid of the modified sequence is at least the second  highest buy order in the original sequence, due to the fact that the books are different only in one order.
Now recall that in state a¯b we have that the sell books are identical, and that the two buy books are identical except one different order.
Let Σ be a sequence and let Σ be any k-modification of Σ.
Let Σ be any sequence.
|lastbid(Σ) − lastbid(Σ )| ≤ Pk =1 s +1(Σ) ≤ ksk+1(Σ) 2.
Then the prices of
