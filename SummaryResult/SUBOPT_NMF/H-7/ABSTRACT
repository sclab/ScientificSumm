Learning the model parameters to  optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive.
The commonly used EM  algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in IR applications.
This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user  profiles.
A  system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model.
The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by
