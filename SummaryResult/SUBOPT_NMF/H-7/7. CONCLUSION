Evaluation on the Reuters data set showed that the new technique performed similar to the standard EM algorithm when the sparseness condition does not hold.
The research is important because scalability is a major concern for researchers when using the Bayesian hierarchical linear modeling approach to build a practical large scale system, even though the literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of the models in many applications.
The research has much potential to benefit people using EM algorithm on many other IR problems as well as  machine learning problems.
Our work is one major step on the road to make Bayesian
