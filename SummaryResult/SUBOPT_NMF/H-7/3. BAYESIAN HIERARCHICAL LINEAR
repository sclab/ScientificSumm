The system can predict the user label y of a document x given an estimation of wm (or wm"s distribution) using a function y = f(x, w).
We assume a user model is sampled randomly from a prior distribution P(w|Φ).
Assume that each user model wm is an independent draw from a population distribution P(w|Φ), which is governed by some unknown hyperparameter Φ.
The rating , y , for a document , x , is conditioned on the document and the user model , wm , associated with the user m. Users share information about their
