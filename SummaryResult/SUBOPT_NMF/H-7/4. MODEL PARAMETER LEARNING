One major drawback of the EM algorithm is that the  importance of a feature, µk, may be greatly dominated by users who have never encountered this feature (i.e.
Here we assume that whether or not that this director directed a specific movie is represented by the kth dimension.
Thus the corresponding weight of the director in the prior µk at the first M step would be very low , and the variance σm,k will be large (Equations 8 and 7).
At the M step , the standard EM algorithm uses the numerical solution of the distribution P ( wm|Dm ,
