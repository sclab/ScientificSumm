One well-received approach to improve recommendation system performance for a particular user is borrowing  information from other users through a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach.
The effectiveness of these different approaches is mixed, due to how well the underlying model assumption fits the data.
However, a content based  recommendation system often handles documents in a very high dimensional space, in which each document is represented by a very sparse vector.
The basic idea is that instead of calculating the numerical solution for all the user profile parameters , we derive the analytical solution of the parameters for some feature dimensions ,
