It is only after such studies have been run and analysed in this way can we develop an understanding of IRF that allow it to be successfully implemented in operational IR systems. 
Studies of this nature are important to establish the circumstances where a promising technique such as IRF are useful and those when it is not.
Our conclusions per each research question are : ( i ) IRF is generally more useful for complex search tasks , where searchers want to focus on the search task and get new ideas for their search from the system , ( ii
