In our pilot tests (and in a posteriori analysis of the main experiment results) we verified that subjects reporting of individual task complexity matched our estimation of the complexity of the task.
They were asked to read the task, place themselves in the situation it described and find the information they felt was required to complete the task.
By developing tasks of different complexity we can assess how the nature of the task affects the subjects" interactive behaviour and hence the evidence supplied to IRF algorithms.
Throughout the night they seem to be complaining about everything they can ,
