In a 2D M × M grid map, each cell i is surrounded by four neighboring cells (i− 1), (i+ 1), (i− M), (i+ M) (except for the 405 outermost cells) and eight different edge structures.
Much of the existing work falls into this category.
Query processing for the spectator S means to search the node structure whose cell region intersects with S. In Figure 3(a), E2 is indexed on the same cell, thus being delivered to the client S after the query evaluation.
Figure 3 ( b ) illustrates how edge structures are constructed from node structures ,
