To estimate the degree of real-time support of our  indexing method, we used the total elapsed time of updating all moving entities and computing visible sets for every cell.
6.2.2 Experimental Results Periodic Monitoring Cost : Tables 6 and 7 show the performance numbers of different edge indexing methods by varying v. The moving speed of entities was also uniformly assigned between 0 and v. In a slowly moving environment ( Table 6 ) , the incremental edge indexing method outperforms full update edge indexing , due to reduced index updates ; the two-table approach surpasses the performance of single-table
