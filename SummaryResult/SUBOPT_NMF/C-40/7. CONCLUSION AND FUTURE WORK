Our edge indexing model, however, can overcome such higher indexing complexity by indexing spatial extensions at edge-level not at node-level in a grid partitioned sub-world and was validated through quantitative analyses and simulations.
However, for now our edge indexing still retains a higher  complexity, even in a two-dimensional domain.
Currently, we are  developing another edge indexing method to make the indexing  complexity constant.
Once indexing complexity becomes constant, we plan to index 3D spatial extensions and multi-resolutional  geometry data.
We expect that our edge indexing can contribute to  successful deployment of next-generation gaming environments.
