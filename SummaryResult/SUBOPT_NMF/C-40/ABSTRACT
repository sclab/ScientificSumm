Specifically, performing real-time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub-millions of active users are moving and interacting.
We recognize that the  described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi-dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query.
Unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments.
In such systems , the determination of the set of
