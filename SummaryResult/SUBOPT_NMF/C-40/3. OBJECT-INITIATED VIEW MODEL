However, the user-initiated model has a serious object popping problem during navigation.
All object entities have their own AOI centered at their current location while all spectator entities have no AOI.
However, we employ a  squareshaped AOI at the expense of accuracy because the square-shaped spatial extension is very simple and efficient to be indexed in a grid partitioned world.
Note that our view model is not intended to rival a sophisticated visibility decision algorithm such as visibility culling [6], but to  efficiently filter out unnecessary entities that do not contribute to the final image.
A huge object may have
