In this  section we focus on evaluating the performance difference between single-table edge indexing and two-table edge indexing.
The total elapsed time of full update based single-table edge indexing for a given set of moving entities is the summation of the elapsed time of updates and cell evaluations : ( Ta + Td + Ts ) · { |Q| + |O|2 ( m + 1 ) } ( 7 ) Similarly , the total elapsed time of two-table edge indexing is as follows : ( Ta + Td + Ts ) · { |Q| + |O|2 ( m + 1
