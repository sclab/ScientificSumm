The FD module implements a failure detector; we assume that it ensures the Stack 1 UDP1RP2P1 Repl CT1 1ABc.
Repl CT1 ABc.1 Network FD1 GM1 rp2p nt udp d f abcast consensus Stack 1 Repl CT1 1ABc.
The latter implementation of AGC uses the Cactus protocol framework [5, 2].
The left stack in Figure 6 shows the implementation of AGC with our service-based framework.
We denote by ti(m) the time between the moment of sending m and the moment of delivering m on a machine (stack) i.
Our experiment has involved 7 machines ( stacks ) that ABcast messages
