In this paper, we propose a new approach for  building modular protocols, that is based on a service  abstraction.
allow for a fairly straightforward protocol composition, clear  implementation, and better support of dynamic replacement of distributed protocols.
Section 5 discusses the advantages of a service-based protocol framework compared to an event-based protocol framework.
All these features of protocol frameworks make them an interesting enabling technology for implementing adaptable systems [14] - an important class of applications.
However, in our opinion, this  solution is not satisfactory since composition of complex  protocol stacks becomes more difficult.
Section 2 defines  general notions.
