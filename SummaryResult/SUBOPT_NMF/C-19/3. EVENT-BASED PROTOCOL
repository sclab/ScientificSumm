Stack 1 P1 Q1 R1 S1 Network f e gg deliver send h Figure 2: Example of an event-based protocol stack In Figure 2, we show an example of an event-based stack.
A white trapezoid inside a module box represents a handler defined by the protocol module.
Handlers of the same protocol module may share data.
Below, we present the features that influence  composition and implementation of protocol modules.
a protocol module that triggers an event is not aware of the module(s) that handle the event.
Each protocol module has to subscribe to one or many  channels.
