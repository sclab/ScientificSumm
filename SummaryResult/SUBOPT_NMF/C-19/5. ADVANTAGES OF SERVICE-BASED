When modules Si triggers event h to emulate a  reply (remember that a reply can occur in many stacks), both modules Qi and Ri will handle the reply (they both contain a handler bound to h).
However, the protocol programmer must take channels into account when implementing protocols.
Module S1 handles the request.
In service-based frameworks, notifications are also well modeled.
We explain now that service based frameworks provide a mechanism to preserve this link, while in event-based frameworks, the lack of such mechanism leads to error-prone composition.
The two-sided arrows point to the protocol modules P1 and newP1 that
