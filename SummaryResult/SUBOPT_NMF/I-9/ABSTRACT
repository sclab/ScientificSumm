In this paper, we investigate an approach to model commitments with tight integration with protocol actions.
This means that there is no need to have an explicit mapping from protocols  actions to operations on commitments and an external  mechanism to process and enforce commitments.
We show how agents can reason about commitments and protocol actions to achieve the end results of protocols using a reasoning  system based on temporal linear logic, which incorporates both temporal and resource-sensitive reasoning.
We also discuss the application of this framework to scenarios such as online commerce.
