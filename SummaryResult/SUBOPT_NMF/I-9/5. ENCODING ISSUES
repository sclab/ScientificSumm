Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to  execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as  compared to traditional approaches.
To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.
In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a  sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to  select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than  selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.
