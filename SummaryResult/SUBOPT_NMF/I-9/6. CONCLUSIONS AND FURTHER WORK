Our further work will include using TLL to verify  various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.
Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created  accordingly.
Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.
The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.
Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.
These approaches use logic systems that are
