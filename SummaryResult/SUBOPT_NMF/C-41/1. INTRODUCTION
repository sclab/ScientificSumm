In our case study, which involves a distributed real-time video distribution system, the task of adaptive  resource management is to control the utilization of the  different resources, whose utilizations are described by  continuous variables.
In open DRE systems, adaptive middleware must make such modifications dependably, i.e., while meeting  stringent end-to-end QoS requirements, which requires the  specification and enforcement of upper and lower bounds on system resource utilization to ensure effective use of  system resources.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows : Section 2 describes the architecture , functionality , and resource utilization model of our DRE multimedia
