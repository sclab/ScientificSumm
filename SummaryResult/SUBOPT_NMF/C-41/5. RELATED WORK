The control variables in such systems are therefore intrinsically discrete.
HyARM handles both continuous control variables, such as picture resolution, and discrete control variable, such as discrete set of frame rates.
While this assumption holds for certain classes of systems, there are many classes of DRE systems, such as avionics and total-ship computing environments that only support a finite a priori set of  discrete configurations.
HyARM can therefore be applied to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of control variables.
FCS  algorithms are modeled and designed using rigorous  controltheoretic methodologies.
FCS algorithms dynamically adjust resource allocation by means of
