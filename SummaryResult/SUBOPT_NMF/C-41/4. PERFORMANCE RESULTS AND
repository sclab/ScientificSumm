We also used application QoS as a metric to evaluate HyARM"s capabilities to support end-to-end QoS requirements of the various classes of applications in the DRE multimedia  system.
For system resource utilization, we compare (1) network  bandwidth utilization of the local area network and (2) CPU utilization at the two UAV nodes.
4.3 Empirical Results and Analysis This section presents the results obtained from running the experiment described in Section 4.2 on our DRE  multimedia system testbed.
Figure 4 shows that HyARM maintains system utilization close to the desired utilization set point during fluctuation in input work load
