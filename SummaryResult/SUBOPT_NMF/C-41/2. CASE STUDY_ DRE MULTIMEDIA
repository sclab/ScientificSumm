The computing power required by the video capture and encoding tasks depends on dynamic factors, such as speed of the UAV, speed of the subject (if the subject is mobile), and distance between UAV and the subject.
QoS-enabled class of applications have higher priority over best-effort class of application.
For example, since a stream from an emergency response application is of higher importance than a video stream from a surveillance application, it  receives more resources end-to-end.
Over-utilization of system resources occurs when the  current resource utilization is higher than the desired upper bound on resource utilization.
These QoS requirements can
