TAO"s A/V Streaming service is an implementation of the CORBA A/V  Streaming Service specification.
From the perspective of hybrid control theoretic techniques [8], the different video compression schemes and frame rate form the discrete  variables of application execution and picture resolution forms the continuous variables.
Application adapters are collocated with  applications since the two interact closely.
Application adapter(s), that are collocated with the application, modify the input parameters to the  application - in our case video encoder - to modify the application resource utilization and QoS.
This adaptation process ensures that system resources are utilized efficiently and end-to-end application
