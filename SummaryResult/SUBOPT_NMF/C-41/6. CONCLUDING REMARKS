This paper described HyARM, an adaptive middleware, that provides effective resource management to DRE  systems.
We employed HyARM to a  representative DRE multimedia system that is implemented using Real-time CORBA and CORBA A/V Streaming Service.
HyARM employs hybrid control techniques to  provide the adaptive middleware capabilities, such as resource monitoring and application adaptation that are key to  providing the dynamic resource management capabilities for open DRE systems.
To meet end-to-end QoS in dynamic environments, DRE systems can benefit from an adaptive middleware that monitors system resources, performs efficient application workload  management, and enables efficient resource provisioning for  executing applications.
