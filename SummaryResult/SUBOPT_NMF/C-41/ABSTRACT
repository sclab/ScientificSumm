Second, we evaluate the adaptive behavior of HyARM via experiments on a DRE multimedia system that distributes video in real-time.
First, we describe the structure and functionality of the Hybrid Adaptive  Resourcemanagement Middleware (HyARM), which provides  adaptive resource management using hybrid control techniques for adapting to workload fluctuations and resource  availability.

Our results indicate that HyARM yields predictable, stable, and high system performance, even in the face of fluctuating workload and resource availability.
This paper presents two contributions to research in adaptive
