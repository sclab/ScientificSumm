By the greedy property, every i = i also has at least this load at this point, so P j p2 i jx2 i j ≥ ˆT.
Now consider the point in the execution of the algorithm on instance p2 just before the last high job is assigned to i in Step 3 (there must be such a job since n2,1 L > 0).
Since |S| · L ≤ TL (by  Corollary 5.9), it follows that n2,1 L > n2,1 H ≥ 0.
Consider the following flow for ( p1 , TL ) : assign to every machine other than i the lowassignment
