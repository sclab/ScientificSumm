, K, into maximal segments, where a maximal segment is a maximal set of consecutive indices k , k + 1, .
We set k = k, and then start a new maximal segment with index k + 1.
, k ,P k −1≤k<k xk+1 ij ` pk ij − pk+1 ij ´ ≥ 0.
This follows because there must be some k such that pk ij = Hj > pk−1 ij = Lj.
