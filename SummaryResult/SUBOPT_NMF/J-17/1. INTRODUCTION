Interestingly, the proof of truthfulness is not based on supplying  explicit prices, and our construction does not necessarily yield efficiently-computable prices (but the allocation rule is  efficiently computable).
This model generalizes the  classic restricted machines setting, where pij ∈ {Lj, ∞} which has been well-studied algorithmically.
Such difficulties in moving from the single-dimensional to the multidimensional setting also arise in other mechanism design settings (e.g., combinatorial auctions).
Instead we exploit certain algorithmic monotonicity conditions that characterize truthfulness to first design an implementable algorithm , i.e. , an algorithm for which prices ensuring truthfulness exist , and then find these prices
