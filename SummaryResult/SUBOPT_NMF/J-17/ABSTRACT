Cycle monotonicity [23] is a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness, is a generalization of value monotonicity for multidimensional domains.
We give a general  technique to convert any c-approximation algorithm to a  3capproximation truthful-in-expectation mechanism.

Our constructions are novel in two respects.
This builds upon a technique of [16], and shows the usefulness of fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design.
This is a multidimensional scheduling domain , and the only known positive results for makespan minimization in such
