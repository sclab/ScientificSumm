The mechanism is  truthful if for every i, every v−i ∈ V−i = Q i =i Vi , and any vi, vi ∈ Vi we have vi(a) − Pi(vi, v−i) ≥ vi(b) − Pi(vi, v−i), where a = f(vi, v−i) and b = f(vi, v−i).
[ 15 ] ) that the price Pi can only depend on the alternative chosen and the others '' declarations , that is , we may write Pi : V−i × A → R. Thus , truthfulness implies that for every i , every v−i ∈ V−i , and any vi , vi
