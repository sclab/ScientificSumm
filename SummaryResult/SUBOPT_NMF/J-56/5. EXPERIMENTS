Some of the optimal solutions for the smallest auctions with 100 bids have only one winning bidder.
Also, repair solutions for bids that contain a small number of items may be made difficult by the fact that a reduced number of bids cover only a subset of those items.
Initially we  assume that no backtracking was permitted on assignments of items to other winning bids given a bid withdrawal elsewhere in the  solution.
Prior to finding a robust solution we solved the WDP optimally using lp_solve [3].
