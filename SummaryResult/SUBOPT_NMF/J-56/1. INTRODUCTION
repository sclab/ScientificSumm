Robustness may be regarded as a preventative measure protecting against future uncertainty by  sacrificing revenue in place of solution stability and reparability.
We propose the use of the Weighted Super 183 Solutions (WSS) framework [13] for constraint programming, that is ideal for establishing such robust solutions.
A robust solution that is  tolerant of such breaks is preferable.
In such situations the bid-taker may be left with a set of items deemed to be of low value by all other bidders.
This motivates the use of robust solutions and Section 3 introduces a constraint programming ( CP ) framework , Weighted
