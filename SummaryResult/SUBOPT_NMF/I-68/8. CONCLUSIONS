However, similarly to [6], they fail to address the lack of global state knowledge, which is a fundamental issue in decentralized planning.
Finally, value function techniques have been studied in context of single agent MDPs [7] [9].
Beyond OC-DEC-MDP, there are other locally optimal algorithms for DEC-MDPs and  DECPOMDPs [8] [12], [13], yet, they have traditionally not dealt with uncertain execution times and temporal constraints.
Unfortunately, they fail to scale up to large-scale domains at present time.
Furthermore, as discussed in Section 4, there are globally optimal algorithms for solving DEC-MDPs with temporal constraints [1] [11].
