In this paper, we improve a state-of-the-art heuristic solution method for DEC-MDPs, called OC-DEC-MDP, that has recently been shown to scale up to larger DEC-MDPs.
Our experimental results demonstrate a  significant speedup of VFP over OC-DEC-MDP as well as higher solution qualities in a variety of situations.

We test both improvements  independently in a crisis-management domain as well as for other types of domains.
Furthermore , it achieves better solution qualities than OC-DEC-MDP because , as our analytical results show , it does not overestimate
