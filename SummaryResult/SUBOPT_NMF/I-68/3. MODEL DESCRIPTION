In  particular, for an agent Ak, all its methods form a chain linked by predecessor constraints.
Consequently, if mj ∈ Mk is the next method to be executed by the agent Ak and the current time is t ∈ [0, Δ], the agent has to make a decision whether to Execute the method mj (denoted as E), or to Wait (denoted as W).
In case agent Ak decides to Execute the next method , two outcomes are possible : Success : The agent Ak receives reward rj and moves on to its next method ( if such method exists )
