We tested chains of 10, 20 and 30 methods, increasing at the same time method time windows to 350, 700 and 1050 to ensure that later methods can be reached.
As we see, for this small domain, VFP runs 15% faster than  OCDEC-MDP when computing the policy with an error of less than 1%.

To obtain the baseline for the heuristic performance , we implemented a globally optimal solver , that found a true
