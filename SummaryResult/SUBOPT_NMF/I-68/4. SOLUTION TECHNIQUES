It then performs two steps: Step 1: It propagates from sink methods to source methods the values Vi,[τ,τ ], that represent the expected utility for executing method mi in the time interval [τ, τ ].
Step 2: Given the values Vi,[τ,τ ] from Step 1, the algorithm chooses the most profitable method execution intervals which are stored in a new policy π .
Since the runtime of the whole algorithm is proportional to the runtime of this operation, especially for big time horizons Δ, the OC-  DECMDP algorithm runs slow.
The idea of the OC-DECMDP algorithm is to start with
