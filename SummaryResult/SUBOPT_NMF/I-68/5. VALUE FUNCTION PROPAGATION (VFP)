We now prove that the overall approximation error accumulated during the value function propagation phase can be expressed in terms of P and V : THEOREM 1.
We now show how in the general case (Figure 2) propagate the probability functions forward through one method, i.e., we assume that the probability functions [Pik ]K k=0 of methods [mik ]K k=0 are known, and the probability function Pj0 of method mj0 must be derived.
Then at each iteration it : ( i ) Propagates the value functions [ vi ] |M| i=1 using the old probability functions [ Pi ] |M| i=1
