However, OC-DEC-MDP is still slow, especially as the time horizon and the number of methods approach large  values.
In this context, we present VFP (= Value Function P ropagation), an efficient solution technique for the DEC-MDP model with  temporal constraints and uncertain method execution durations, that builds on the success of OC-DEC-MDP.
Although globally optimal algorithms for these subclasses have demonstrated promising results, domains on which these algorithms run are still small and time horizons are limited to only a few time ticks.
Sections 5 and 6 discuss the two orthogonal improvements to the state-of-the-art OC-DEC-MDP algorithm that our VFP algorithm
