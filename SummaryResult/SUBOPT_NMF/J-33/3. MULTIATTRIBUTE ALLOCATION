No aggregation and configuration parity (Definitions 4 and 9).
DEFINITION 16 (MMP).
DEFINITION 14 (SURPLUS OF A TRADE IN CONTEXT).
Divisibility, linear pricing, and configuration parity  (Definitions 1, 10, and 9), with combination offer set defined as the minimal set consistent with configuration aggregation  (Definition 6).2 Then the solution to GMAP consists of a set of trades, each of which employs a configuration that solves MMP for its specified pair of traders.
DEFINITION 13 (TRADE UNIT SURPLUS).
Then t ∈ MMPd (b, s) iff xt = arg max x {ˆub(x) − ˆus(x)} qt = min(¯qb, ¯qs).
Suppose that
