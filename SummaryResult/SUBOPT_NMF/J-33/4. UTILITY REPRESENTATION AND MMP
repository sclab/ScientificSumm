A set of attributes Y ⊂ X is preferentially independent (PI) of its complement Z = X \ Y if the conditional preference order over Y given a fixed level Z0 of Z is the same regardless of the choice of Z0 .
A utility function over outcomes including money is quasi-linear if the function can be represented as a function over non-monetary attributes plus payments, π. Interpreting ˆu as a utility function over non-monetary attributes is tantamount to assuming quasi-linearity.
We present the premises of additive utility theory in this section, and discuss some generalizations in the next.
There are several challenges
