In this work, we investigate the space of two-sided multiattribute auctions, focusing on the relationship between constraints on the offers traders can express through bids, and the resulting  computational problem of determining an optimal set of trades.
We  developed a formal semantic framework for characterizing expressible offers, and introduced some basic classes of restrictions.
The extent to which the space of feasible mechanisms may be quantified a priori will facilitate the search for such exchanges in the full mechanism design problem.
For multiattribute exchanges , the space of feasible such mechanisms is constrained by computational limitations imposed by the clearing
