To better reflect reality we would like to validate the observations obtained from this study with some real world  simulation traces of vehicular movements (for example using  CORSIM [1]).
We are currently  analyzing the performance of zebroids on a real world data set  comprising of an ad-hoc network of buses moving around a small  neighborhood in Amherst [4].
This will also serve as a validation for the utility of the Markov mobility model used in this study.
Extensions to zebroids that satisfy such application  requirements presents an interesting future research direction. 
Zebroids may also be used for delivery of data
