γ represents the duration of the client"s journey in terms of the number of time slots.
If a replica for the data item requested was encountered by the client in the first cell then we set δ = 0.
• Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement.
We employ a replication scheme that allocates replicas for a data item as a function of the square-root of the frequency of access of that item.
Note that the replacements performed by the zebroids will cause changes to the data item replica distribution.
