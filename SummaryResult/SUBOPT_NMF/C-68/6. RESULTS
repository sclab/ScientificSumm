As N is further increased, Ï‰ reduces because the total storage in the system goes up.
Figure 3 captures case 1 mentioned above.
Hence, the replacement overhead per client request can amount to a  maximum of one.
We find that zebroids continue to provide improvements in  availability latency even with lower accuracy in the car route  predictions.
This is because in the former case, each of these z zebroids selected along the lowest latency path to the client needs to perform a replacement.
6.3 What is the overhead incurred with  improvements in latency with zebroids?
Let Xri and XNc i
