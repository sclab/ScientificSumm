In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.
Using  analysis and extensive simulations, we gain novel insights into the  design of carrier-based systems.
Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead.
These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes.
Two particularly surprising findings are : ( 1 ) a naive random replacement policy employed by the
