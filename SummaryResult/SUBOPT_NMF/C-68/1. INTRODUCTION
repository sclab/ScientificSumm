Selection of zebroids is facilitated by the two-tiered architecture.
2 There may be dispatchers deployed at a subset of the base-stations for fault-tolerance and robustness.
When z = 0 there are no carriers, requiring a server to deliver the data item directly to the client.
(The terms car and AutoMata are used interchangeably in this study.)
In this study , we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids : ( i ) data item repository size , ( ii ) car density , ( iii ) storage capacity per car , ( iv )
