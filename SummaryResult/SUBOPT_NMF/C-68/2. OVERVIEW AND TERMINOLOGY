We now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by Ri, as: Ri = (fi)n T j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) The exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.
Table 1: Terms and their definitions size Si.
In this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.
Note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i , by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the client ''
