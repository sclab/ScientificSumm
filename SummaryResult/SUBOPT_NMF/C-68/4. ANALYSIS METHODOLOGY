[2] show that the the meeting time of two random walks in such a setting can be modelled as an exponential distribution with the mean C = c · G · log G, where the constant c 0.17 for G ≥ 25.
Moreover, this replica is spawned at the time step when the client issues the request.
Details of the procedure to obtain a closed-form expression are given in [9].
It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing  oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).
