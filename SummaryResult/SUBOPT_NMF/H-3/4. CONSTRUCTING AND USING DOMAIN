Therefore, we employ an EM process to extract the specific part of the domain as follows: we assume that the documents in a domain are generated by a domain-specific model (to be extracted) and general language model (collection model).
In this study, we use a simple classification method: the selected domain is the one with which the query"s KL-divergence score is the lowest, i.e.
These documents are the top-ranked documents retrieved with the original query within the domain.
The EM algorithm is used to extract the domain model Domθ that maximizes P ( Dom| θ '' Dom )
