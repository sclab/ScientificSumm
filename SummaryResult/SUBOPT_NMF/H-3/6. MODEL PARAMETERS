The mixture weights αi of component models are trained on the same training data using the following method of line search [11] to maximize the Mean Average Precision (MAP): each parameter is considered as a search direction.
We start by searching in one direction - testing all the values in that direction, while keeping the values in other directions unchanged.
The value λ=0.5 is determined to maximize the effectiveness of the baseline models (see Section 7.2) on the training data: TREC queries 1-50 and documents on Disk 2.
Each direction is searched in turn , until no improvement in MAP is
