In these cases, we construct two models for the query: the initial query model containing only the original terms, and a new model containing the added terms.
In particular, all the related and presumed words should be included in the query model.
0 Qθ can be created by MLE.
Then the document score in Equation (1) is extended as follows: ( ) ∑∑∑ ∈∈ ∈ == Xi ii Vt Xi D i Qi DQScoretPtPDQScore ),()|(log)|(, αθθα (4) where )|(log)|(),( D Vt i Qi tPtPDQScore θθ∑∈ = is the score according to each component model.
They are then combined through interpolation.
Let us use
