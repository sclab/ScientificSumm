Here, we use a simple co-occurrence analysis.
Windows of fixed size (10 words in our case) are used to obtain co-occurrence counts of three terms, and the probability )|( kji tttP is determined as follows: ∑= lt kjlkjikji tttctttctttP ),,(),,()|( (9) where ),,( kji tttc is the count of co-occurrences.
In general, a term relation can be represented as A→B.
Adding more terms into the condition will create many rarely applicable relations ; • In most cases , an ambiguous word such as Java can be effectively disambiguated by one useful context word such as computer or hotel ; • The addition of
