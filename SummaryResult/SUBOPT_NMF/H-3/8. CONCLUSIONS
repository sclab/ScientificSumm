Our experimental results strongly confirm the benefit of using contexts in IR.
Previous investigations on context focused on factors around the query.
We have integrated the above contextual factors, together with feedback model, in a single language model.
In this paper, we argue that a single user profile (or model) can contain a too large variety of different topics so that new queries can be incorrectly biased.
This work also shows that the language modeling framework is appropriate for integrating many contextual factors.
Many previous studies have investigated the integration of some contextual factors in IR models , typically by
