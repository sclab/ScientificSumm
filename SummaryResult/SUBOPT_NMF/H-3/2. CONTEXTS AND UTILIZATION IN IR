To remedy this problem, approaches have been proposed to make a selection of expansion terms after the application of relations [24][31].
Typically, one defines some sort of global relation between the expansion term and the whole query, which is usually a sum of its relations to every query word.
If a query contains term t1, then t2 is always considered as a candidate for expansion.
For example, [17] defined strong logical relations to encode knowledge of different domains.
the lack of context information in term relations : by introducing stricter conditions in a relation , for example { Java
