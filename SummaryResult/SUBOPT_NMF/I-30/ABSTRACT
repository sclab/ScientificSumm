We develop an algorithm based on the contract-net  protocol.
Three  different types of networks, namely small-world, random and scale-free networks, are used to represent various social  relationships among agents in realistic applications.
Our algorithm is completely distributed, and it assumes that agents have only local knowledge about tasks and  resources.
We conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the performance and scalability of the proposed algorithm in terms of solution quality and computation time.
This paper proposes a new variant of the task allocation problem , where the agents are connected in a social network and tasks arrive at the
