Networks have been employed in the context of task  allocation in some other works as well, for example to limit the 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Time(ms) Agents upper bound - small-world upper bound - random upper bound - scale-free GDAP - small-world GDAP - random GDAP - scale-free Figure 7: The run time of the GDAP algorithm.
Other work [17] proposes a location mechanism for open multiagent systems to  allocate tasks to unknown agents.
Agents are then allowed to move and actively search for tasks , and the capability of
