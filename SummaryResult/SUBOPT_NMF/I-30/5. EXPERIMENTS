In this figure we can see that a high average degree also leads to  convergence of the upper bound and the GDAP.
In this experiment, in the small-world network almost every manager has a degree of six.
in social networks with a low average degree.2 Since the solution quality clearly depends on the resource ratio as well as on the degree of the social network, we study the effect of changing both, to see whether they influence each other.
Therefore, the GDAP is able to give quite a good allocation.
Setting 2.
This setting is similar to Setting 1 ,
