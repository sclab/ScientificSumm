Create a network flow problem for each resource type r ∈ R (separately) as follows: (a) Create a source s and a sink s .
(b) For each agent a ∈ A create an agent node and an edge from s to this node with capacity equal to the amount of resources of type r agent a has.
4.3 Upper bound for social task allocation Given a social task allocation problem, if the number of resource types for every task t ∈ T is bounded by 1, the Algorithm 3 An upper bound for social task allocation (UB).
The flow network
