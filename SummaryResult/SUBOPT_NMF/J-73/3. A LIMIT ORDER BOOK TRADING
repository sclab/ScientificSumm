For an algorithm A which is constrained to sell exactly N shares, we define the OWT competitive ratio of A, ROWT(A), as the maximum ratio (under any S ∈ Σ) of the revenue  obtained by A, as compared to the revenue obtained by an optimal oﬄine algorithm A∗ .
We generally expect T to be (possibly much) smaller than T .
More formally, define VWAPM (S, S ) as REVM (S, S )/ T t=1 wt, where the denominator is just the total executed volume of orders placed by the  market.
Consider the order book model under the bounded order volume and max
