, log(Q) − 1, Pbins vol (i) is equal to the  probability, under Pvol , that the daily volume falls in the interval [Vmin 2i−1 , Vmin 2i ), and Pbins vol (log(Q)) is for the last interval [Vmax /2, Vmax ] .
We define E as E(Pbins vol ) ≡ Ei∼P bins vol 1/Pbins vol (i) 2 =   log(Q) i=1 Pbins vol (i)   2 .
All proofs in this section are provided in the appendix.
Our results in the VWAP setting examine the cases where these distributions are known exactly or only approximately.
