Therefore, in this case the competitive ratio is Ω(Q).
(Sketch of Theorem 10) We use the idea of  guessing the total volume from Theorem 1, but now allow for the possibility of an arbitrary (but known) distribution over the total volume.
Let the algorithm guess ˆV = Vmin 2i with probability Gbins vol (i).
The VWAP is pmax and the fixed schedule average is (N/T)pmax + (N − N/T)pmin .
We then get that Gbins vol (i) ∝ Pbins vol (i) minimizes the upper bound, which leads to the upper bound stated in the theorem.
In the first case the
