Then at each time t, if the market price and volume is (pt, vt), the algorithm sells a fraction vt/ ˆV of its shares.
In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online algorithm A for selling N shares achieving competitive ratio RVWAP(A) ≤ 2 log(Q).
For the OWT problem in the price-volume model,  volumes are irrelevant for the performance criterion, but for the VWAP criterion they are central.
We can derive an O ( log ( Q ) ) VWAP competitive ratio by running these algorithms in parallel , and letting each algorithm
