This efficient trajectory of state updates can be combined to the approach proposed here since this paper focusses on the definition of tight bounds, and efficient state update for a constrained resource allocation problem.
To do this, McMahan et 1212 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS al.
To solve this problem efficiently, we adapt  Qdecomposition proposed by Russell and Zimdars [9].
Firstly, if the resources are already shared among the agents, and the actions made by an agent does not influence the state of another agent, the globally optimal policy can be computed by planning separately for each agent.
