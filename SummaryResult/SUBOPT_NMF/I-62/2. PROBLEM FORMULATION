Russell and Zimdars called this approach local Sarsa.
An agent i uses as the value of a possible state transition s the Q-value for this agent which determines the maximal global Q-value for state s as in the original Q-decomposition approach.
Here, Qi (ai, s ) determines the optimal Q-value of agent i in state s .
Another example of this type comes from our problem of interest, explained in Section 3, which is a naval platform which must counter incoming missiles (i.e.
To coordinate with each other , each agent i reports its action values Qi ( ai , si )
