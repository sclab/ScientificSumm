boundedrtdp with our proposed bounds may apply to a wide range of stochastic environments.
For  instance, frtdp [11], and brtdp [6] are both efficient  heuristic search algorithms.
The only condition for the use our bounds is that each task possesses consumable and/or non-consumable limited resources.
In particular, both these approaches proposed an efficient state trajectory updates, when given upper and lower bounds.
An interesting research avenue would be to experiment our bounds with other heuristic search algorithms.
Furthermore, The marginal revenue bound proposed in this paper compares favorably to the Singh and Cohn [10] approach.
Finally , the bounded-rtdp function
