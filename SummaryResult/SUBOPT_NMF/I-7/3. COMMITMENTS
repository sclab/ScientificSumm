We write Σi for the set of mixed strategies available to player i, and Σ = Σ1 × · · · × Σn for the set of mixed strategy profiles.
A mixed strategy σi for a player i is a probability distribution over Ai.
If Col can make a  conditional commitment of playing the right column if Row chooses top, and the left column otherwise, this leaves Row with the easy choice between a payoff of zero or one, and Col may expect a payoff of three.
