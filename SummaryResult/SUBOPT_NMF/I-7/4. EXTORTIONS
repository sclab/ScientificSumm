We may conclude that x is an extortion of order m. For the only if direction, assume that x is an extortion of G given π.
We prove that there is a benign backward induction f (∗) in G∗ for πR with f (∗) = x.
, xπn ) is an extortion of order m − 1.
We prove by induction on m, that f (∗) is a benign backward induction of order m, for each m with 0 m n. The basis is trivial.
, xπn ) of G relative to π.
So assume that f ( ∗ ) is a backward induction of
