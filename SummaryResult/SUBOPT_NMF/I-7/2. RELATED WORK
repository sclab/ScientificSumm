We, however, consider a number of different commitment types, among which conditional commitments, and propose a generic solution concept. 
Also, commitments have played a  significant role in the theory of equilibrium selection (see, e.g., [13].
Thus, Conitzer and Sandholm [2] have studied the computational complexity of computing the optimal strategy to commit to in normal form and Bayesian games.
Our approach is similar to the Stackleberg setting in that we  assume an order in which the players commit.
Nash"s threat game [5] and Harsanyi"s rational threats [3] are two important early examples.
Recently , also the
