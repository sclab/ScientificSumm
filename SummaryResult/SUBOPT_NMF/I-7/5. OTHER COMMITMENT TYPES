The type of mixed unconditional commitments associates with each game G and ordering π of its players the  tuple Σπ1 , .
In the game of Figure 5 we found that, with conditional  commitments, Mat is unable to enforce an outcome that awards him a  payoff of two.
We distinguish between  conditional, unconditional as well as inductive mixed commitments.
If Mat has inductive commitments at his disposal, however, this is a possibility.
Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game.
The expected payoff of Col does not exceed 21 2 , either ,
