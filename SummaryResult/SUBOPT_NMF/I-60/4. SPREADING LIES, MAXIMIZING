Figure 1 shows the normalized value achieved by the self-interested agents as a function of their number.
We can see that as the number of iterations advances, the lower the normalized value for the beneficiary agent.
On the other hand, if we compare the average journey length in all of the iterations, there is no significant difference between the two settings.
In our third set of experiments we examined a setting in which there was an increasing number of agents, and the agents did not necessarily have the same origin and  destination points.
As in the first set of experiments
