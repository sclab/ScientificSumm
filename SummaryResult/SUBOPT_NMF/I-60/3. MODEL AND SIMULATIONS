The average number of cars passing through the network during the iteration is about 70,000 and the  average number of cars in the network at a specific time unit is about 3,500 cars.
Each of the experiments that we describe below is run with 5 different traffic scenarios.
Those agents are referred to as gossip agents.
Yet, due to congestion caused by too many cars rushing to what is reported as the less congested part of the network 20-30% of gossiping agents leads to the most efficient routing results in their experiments.
The normalized values were calculated by comparing each
