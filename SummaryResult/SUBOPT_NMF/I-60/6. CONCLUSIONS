While the self-interested agents spread lies, they cannot choose which agents with whom they will  interact.
Some reasons for this are the special characteristics of vehicular networks and their dynamic nature.
Also, by the time their lies reach other agents, they might become irrelevant, as more recent data has reached the same agents.
This is in  contrast to the greater impact inflicted by self-interested agents in other domains (e.g., E-Commerce).
Motivated by the simulation results, future research in this field will focus on modeling different behaviors of the self-interested agents, which might cause more damage to the network.
