This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the roads on their route to other agents in the network in the hope of making the other agents believe that the route is jammed, and causing them to choose a different route.
We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.
To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents, we have used a simulation environment, which  models the transportation network in a central part of a large real city.
