By Theorem 1, we must have: P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ ) = p∞ (1) ∀i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞ i ) = p∞ (2) Recall that S∞ i = {y ∈ S∞ |yi = xi}.
Let f(·) be a weighted threshold function  corresponding to weights {wi}, and assume that 0 < p∞ < 1.
Thus , Equation ( 2 ) can be written as ∀i P ( f ( y ) = 1|y ∈ S∞ , yi = xi ) = p∞ ( 3 ) Now define J+ i = P ( yi = 1|y ∈ S∞ , f ( y ) =
