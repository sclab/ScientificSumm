A more satisfying approach would be to  assume only rationality and solve for the resulting  gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current  computational model or another model of an information market.
• The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything about the market behavior when agents" priors are only approximately the same or when they differ  greatly?
6.2 Future work We view this paper as a first step towards understanding the computational power of information markets.
• Distributed computation: In our model, distributed  information is aggregated through a centralized market 163 computation.
Specifically , we show that the market is
