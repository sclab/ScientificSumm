One example is a  market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by Hanson [12].
This suggests that the problem of eliciting  truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of  computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation principle [18].
While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each user"s trades is not observable; this  depends on the details of the market process.
With real inputs and arbitrary prior distributions , however , it is not clear that the
