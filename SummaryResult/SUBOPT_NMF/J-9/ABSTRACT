We also prove a lower bound, showing a type of threshold security that requires at least n/2 rounds to converge in the worst case.
Moreover, these threshold securities converge in at most n rounds, where n is the number of bits of distributed information.
We investigate the computational process on the path toward equilibrium, where information distributed among traders is revealed step-by-step over time and incorporated into the market price.
On the other hand, securities whose payoffs are threshold functions are guaranteed to  converge, for all prior probability distributions.
We show that securities whose payoffs can not be expressed as
