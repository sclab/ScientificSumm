(b) How different types of local knowledge (number, local information repositories, percentage, interests and information provision abilities of acquaintances) can guide agents to effectively answer queries, balancing between efficiency and efficacy.
(c) That the proposed tuning task manages to increase the efficiency of information searching and sharing in highly dynamic and large networks.
Specifically, the paper demonstrates through extensive performance experiments: (a) How networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" so as to provide requested information effectively, increasing the benefit and the efficiency of the system.
( d ) That the information gathered and maintained by agents supports efficient and
