This paper presents a method for information searching and sharing that combines routing indices with  tokenbased methods.
Specifically, the paper demonstrates through performance experiments how static and dynamic networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" to answer queries effectively as they gather evidence for the interests and information provision abilities of others, without altering the topology or imposing an overlay structure to the network of acquaintances.
The proposed method enables agents to search effectively by acquiring their neighbors" interests, advertising their information provision abilities and maintaining indices for routing queries, in an integrated way.
Finding the right agents in
