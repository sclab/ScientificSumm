To show whether initial knowledge about acquaintances local repository (the   case) affects the effective tuning of the network, we provide representative results from the TypeB-20 network.
As it is shown in Figure 4, the tuning task in this case does not manage to achieve the benefit of the system reported for the   case.
Figures 4 and 5 show experiments for static and dynamic networks of TypeA-10 ( dense network with a low percentage of acquaintances ) , TypeB-20 ( quite dense network with a low percentage of acquaintances ) , with initialization and without initialization , and TypeC-50 ( not
