Viewing information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems from a multi-agent system perspective, the approach proposed in [18] is based on a language model of agents" documents collection.
Exploiting the models of other agents in the network, agents construct their view of the network which is being used for forming routing decisions.
However, it is expected that this will complicate re-organization.
In accordance to this approach, in [12,13,14], information sharing is considered only for static networks and self-tuning of networks is not demonstrated.
