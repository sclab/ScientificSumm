However, as far as we know there is no work that demonstrates the effectiveness of a gradual tuning process in large-scale dynamic networks that studies the impact of the information gathered by agents as more and more queries are issued and served in concurrent sessions in the network.
The main issue in this paper concerns â€˜tuning" a network of agents, each with a specific expertise, for efficient and effective information searching and sharing, without altering the topology or imposing an overlay structure via clustering, introduction of shortcut indices, or re-wiring.
They do it mostly by imposing logical and semantic
