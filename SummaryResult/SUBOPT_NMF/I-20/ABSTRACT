In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of  calculating the Banzhaf power index within a particular multiagent  domain, a network flow game.
Agents control the edges of a graph; a coalition wins if it can send a flow of a given size from a source  vertex to a target vertex.
The relative power of each edge/agent reflects its significance in enabling such a flow, and in real-world networks could be used, for example, to allocate resources for maintaining parts of the network.
The Banzhaf power index is one of the most popular ; it is also well-defined for any
