Deng and Papadimitriou [2] show that computing the Shapley value in weighted majority games is #P-complete, using a reduction from KNAPSACK.
There are 2nâˆ’1 such coalitions, so the performance is  exponential in the number of agents.
The normalized Banzhaf index measures the proportion of coalitions in which a player is a swinger, out of all winning coalitions.
Since the number of possible coalitions is exponential in the number of agents,  calculating power indices in time polynomial in the number of agents can only be achieved in specific domains.
Since the Shapley value of any simple game has the same value
