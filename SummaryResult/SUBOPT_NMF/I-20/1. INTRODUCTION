A power index is a measure of the power that a subgroup, or equivalently a voter in a weighted voting environment, has over decisions of a larger group.
The Banzhaf power index is one of the most popular measures of voting power, and although it has been used primarily for measuring power in weighted voting games, it is well-defined for any simple coalitional game.
We show that calculating the Banzhaf power index of each agent in this general network flow domain is #P-complete.
The practical applications of voting among automated agents are already widespread.
In this paper , we consider
