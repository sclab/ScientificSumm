It remains an open problem to find ways to tractably  approximate the Banzhaf index in the general network flow domain.
Although the Banzhaf index theoretically allows us to measure the power of the agents in the network flow game, we have shown that the problem of calculating the Banzhaf index in this domain in #P-complete.
In the case of connectivity games (where it is only required for a coalition to contain a path from the source to the destination) played on bounded layer graphs, it is possible to calculate the Banzhaf index of an agent in polynomial time.
Despite this
