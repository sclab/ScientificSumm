Let Vi(E ) be the subset of vertices in Vi that are reachable from s using only the edges in E : Vi(E ) = {v ∈ Vi|E contains a path from s to v}.
We say E ∈ PredV connects exactly the vertices in Si ⊂ Vi if all the vertices in Si are reachable from s using the edges in E but no other vertices in Vi are reachable from s using E , so Vi(E ) = Si.
Let E , E ⊂ PredVi be two sets of edge subsets , so that E connects exactly the vertices in S1 and
