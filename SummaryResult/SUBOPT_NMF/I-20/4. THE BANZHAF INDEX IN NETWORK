Since such missing subsets of edges do not affect the Banzhaf index of ef (they add 0 to the sum), from now on we will consider only non-missing subsets.
The first run is performed on the game with a target flow of k, v(G ,k), returning the index Î²ef (v(G ,k)).
We denote the network flow game defined on G with target flow k as v(G ,k).
We call such a subset a missing subset.
