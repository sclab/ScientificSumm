3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.
Given a coalition C , which controls the edges EC = { ei|i âˆˆ C } , we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow , and loses otherwise : v ( C ) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t ; 0 otherwise ; A simplified version of the network flow game
