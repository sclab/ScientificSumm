A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.
We say a coalition C âŠ‚ I wins if v(C) = 1, and say it loses if v(C) = 0.
One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index.
A coalitional game is composed of a set of n agents , I , and a function mapping any subset ( coalition
