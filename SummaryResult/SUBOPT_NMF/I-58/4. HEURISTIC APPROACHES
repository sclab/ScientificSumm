P j∈Q qj = 1 q ≥ 0.
(2) The objective function maximizes the follower"s expected reward given x, while the constraints make feasible any mixed strategy q for the follower.
We also denote X and Q the index sets of the leader and follower"s pure strategies, respectively.
Optimal solutions to the follower"s problem are characterized by linear programming optimality conditions: primal feasibility constraints in (2), dual feasibility constraints in (3), and complementary  slackness qj a − X i∈X 1 k Cijxi !
P i∈X xi = k xi ∈ {0, 1, .
These optimal solutions are characterized
