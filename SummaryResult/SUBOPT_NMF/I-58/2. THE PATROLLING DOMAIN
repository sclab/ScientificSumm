We assume that the  robber generally takes a long time to rob a house.
We model the payoffs for this game with the following variables: â€¢ vl,x: value of the goods in house l to the security agent.
The security agent"s set of possible pure strategies (patrol routes) is denoted by X and includes all d-tuples i =< w1, w2, ..., wd > with w1 .
m. The security agent"s set of pure strategies consists of possible routes of d houses to patrol (in an order).
m. The payoffs ( security agent , robber ) for pure strategies
