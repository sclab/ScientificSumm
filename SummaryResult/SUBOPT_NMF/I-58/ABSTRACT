In adversarial multiagent domains, security, commonly defined as the ability to deal with intentional threats from other agents, is a critical issue.
However, it is often the case in multiagent security domains that one agent can commit to a mixed strategy which its adversaries observe before choosing their own strategies.
This paper focuses on domains where these threats come from unknown adversaries.
In this case, the agent can maximize reward by finding an optimal  strategy, without requiring equilibrium.
These domains can be modeled as Bayesian games; much work has been done on finding equilibria for such games.
