5.2 Decomposed MILP We can linearize the quadratic programming problem 7 through the change of variables zl ij = xiql j, obtaining the following  problem maxq,z P i∈X P l∈L P j∈Q pl k Rl ijzl ij s.t.
(7) Problem (7) for a Bayesian game with multiple follower types is indeed equivalent to Problem (5) on the payoff matrix obtained from the Harsanyi transformation of the game.
Proof: Consider x, ql , al with l ∈ L a feasible solution of (7).
The fact that P j∈Q zl ij = xi as P j∈Q ql j = 1 explains constraints 1
