domain of three houses, the optimal method cannot reach a  solution for more than seven robber types, and for four houses it  cannot solve for more than six types within the cutoff time in any of the three scenarios.
On the other hand, ASAP runs much faster, and is able to solve for at least 20 adversaries for the three-house scenarios and for at least 12 adversaries in the four-house  scenarios within the cutoff time.
Each of the three rows of graphs corresponds to a different randomly-generated scenario.
The uniform policy consistently provides the lowest reward in both
