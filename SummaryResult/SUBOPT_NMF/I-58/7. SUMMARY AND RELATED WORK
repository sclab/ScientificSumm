Therefore, we present a heuristic called ASAP, with three key advantages towards addressing this problem.
While that work provides epsilon error-bounds based on the k-uniform strategies, their solution concept is still that of a Nash equilibrium, and they do not provide efficient algorithms for obtaining such k-uniform strategies.

However, the complexity of this problem was shown to be NP-hard in the general case [5], which also provides algorithms for this problem in the non-Bayesian case.
In these environments, intentional threats are caused by adversaries about whom the security patrolling agents have  incomplete information.
Second , it provides strategies
