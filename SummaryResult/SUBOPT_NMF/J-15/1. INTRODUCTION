We propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a flexible preference structure.
The price of a configuration is defined as the sum of the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount.
Our goal, therefore, is to identify the subtler yet more widely applicable structured representations, and exploit these  properties of preferences in trading mechanisms.
Such additivity reduces the complexity of preference  specification exponentially (compared to the general discrete case), but  precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes.
To this end , we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices , which
