Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI conditions on A.
The CDI conditions, in turn, are particularly intuitive to detect when the preference differences carry a direct interpretation, as in the case with monetary  differences discussed below.
Let (a0 1, .
We seek a finer-grain global decomposition of the utility function, similar to that obtained from mutual preferential  independence.
PROPOSITION 4.
Let u(A) be an MVF representing preference  differences.
