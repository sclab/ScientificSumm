LEMMA 12. maxθ∈Θ πt b(θ) does not change in any round t of phase A.
On the other extreme, if the GAI network is connected then e+1 = g. We also note that without assuming any preference structure, meaning that the CDI map is fully connected, g = 1 and the efficiency loss is again .
The definition of Mt j ensures πt b(θj ) < max θ∈Θ πt b(θj) − gj g .
Therefore, πt+1 b (θ ) = πt (θ ) + δ = πt (θ ) + w g ≤ max θ∈Θ πt b(θj).
If ∀r.ˆθr ∈ Mt , then ˆθ ∈ Mt by definition of
