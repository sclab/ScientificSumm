The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we  compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].
It is therefore essential only that the buyer"s preference structure is accurately modeled.
Rather than assuming full additivity, or no  structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.
The only place where this assumption is used in our analysis is for Lemma 8.
Locally , the sellers can
