For this pilot we collected INV and CON sets of similar sizes, and used these sets to evaluate a preliminary list of features and to establish appropriate parameters for the  SnippetShort and Readable features.
These pairs are not included in the sets constructed for the remaining features, since captions with missing snippets do not contain all the elements of a  standard caption and we wanted to avoid their influence.
4.2 Features Figure 4 lists the features tested.
The sets INV+, INV−, CON+, and CON− will contain different subsets of INV and CON for each feature.
