The work of Mu"alem and Nisan [13] is the closest in spirit to our work.
In fact, we do not even require the existence of an  objective function.
Auletta et al.
Given any allocation rule O for a binary demand game, we showed that a truthful mechanism M = (O, P) exists for the game if and only if O satisfies a certain monotonicity  property.
Some mechanisms other than VCG mechanism are needed to address these issues.
They also pointed out that a certain monotonicity in the  allocation rule can lead to a truthful mechanism.
In contrast to the
