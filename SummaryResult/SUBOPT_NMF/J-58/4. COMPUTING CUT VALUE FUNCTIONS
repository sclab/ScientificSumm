If it is not, since ψj (c) satisfies MP, we have ψj i (c) = ψj i (c ) = 0 from ci < ci.
One scenario is that index k is not chosen by the output function O.
The other scenario is that index k is chosen by the output  function O.
Assuming for cost vector c we have (O ◦ F)i(c) = 1, we should prove for any cost vector c = c|i ci with ci < ci, (O ◦ F)i(c ) = 1.
Here Or , cr and Sr are allocation rule, cost vector and game setting in game Gr , respectively.
