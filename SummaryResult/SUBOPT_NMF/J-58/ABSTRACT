In light of these limitations, it is useful to study whether we can design a truthful non-VCG payment scheme that is computationally tractable for a given allocation rule O.
For many optimization problems, finding the optimal output is computationally intractable.
In this paper, we focus our attention on binary demand games in which the agents" only  available actions are to take part in the a game or not to.
They only apply to optimization problems with a utilitarian (or affine)  objective function, and their output should optimize the objective  function.
If we apply VCG mechanisms to polynomial-time algorithms that
