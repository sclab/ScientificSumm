5: Set tr as qi and Pr = LCP(s, qi, c).
Observe that the output Pr, for any round r, satisfies MP, and the update rule for every round  satisfies crossing-independence.
Output: A tree LST rooted at s and spanned all receivers.
3: Construct a virtual complete link weighted graph K(d)  using Q as its node set, where the link qiqj corresponds to the least cost path LCP(qi, qj, d), and its weight is w(qiqj) = |LCP(qi, qj, d)|.
Algorithm 9 Construct VMST 1 : for all pairs of receivers qi , qj âˆˆ Q do 2
