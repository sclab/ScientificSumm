Another research direction is to design an approximation  allocation rule O satisfying MP with a good approximation ratio for a given binary demand game.
The remaining difficulty is then how to compute the payment P under mild assumptions about the valuations if a truthful mechanism M = (O, P) does exist.
We point out here that the goal of this paper is not to design a better allocation rule for a  problem, but to design an algorithm to compute the payments efficiently when O is given.
In this paper, we have concentrated on how to compute P in polynomial time.
