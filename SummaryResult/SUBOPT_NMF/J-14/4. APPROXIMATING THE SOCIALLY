We have |EPVi (s) − EPVi (t)| ≤ X k,l,m=0,1 |Pi klm(tklm − sklm )| ≤ 8Pmax max klm |tklm − sklm | We will now show that for any k, l, m ∈ {0, 1} we have |tklm − sklm | ≤ 3δ; clearly, this implies the lemma.
Moreover , Lemma 3 implies that by choosing δ < / ( 24Pmax/Pmin ) , we can ensure that the Nash equilibrium t produced by our algorithm satisfies nX i=1 EPVi ( s ) − nX i=1 EPVi ( t ) ≤ 24Pmaxδn ≤ nPmin ≤ M ( G ) ,
