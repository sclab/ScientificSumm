CLAIM 3.
165 PROOF.
• For each i = 1, .
Let x and x be some rational numbers in (α , α) and (α, α ), respectively; note that by excluding the endpoints of the intervals we ensure that x , x = 0, 1.
Clearly, α is the only zero (and hence, the only maximum) of R(x) on [α , α ].
• The payoff to U−1 is 0 no matter what everyone else does.
Now, set R(x) = Q1(x) (x+2)...(x+2n+1)(x+2n+2) .
As 1 − x ≤ 1 − ( x − x ) u−1 − x ≤ 1 − x for
