As we assume that Vn is a dummy  vertex whose payoff is identically 0, the Nash equilibrium with these payoffs exists as long as Tn ≤ 0 and B(Vn, Vn−1, T) is not empty.
The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to represent all Nash equilibria that provide required payoffs to the players.
Formally, we say that a strategy v of the player V is a potential best response to a strategy w of its parent W with respect to a threshold vector T = (T1, .
