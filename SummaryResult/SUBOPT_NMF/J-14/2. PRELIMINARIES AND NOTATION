The proof that the number of rectangles in B(Vj+1, Vj) is polynomial proceeds by first showing that the number of event points in B(Vj+1, Vj ) cannot exceed the number of event points in B(Vj, Vj−1) by more than 2, and using this fact to bound the number of rectangles in B(Vj+1, Vj ).
For a vertex V with a single child U and parent W , given any A , B , C , D ∈ Q , A , B , C , D ∈ Q , one can select the payoffs to V so
