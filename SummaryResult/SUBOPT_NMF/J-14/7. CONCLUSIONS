It is natural to ask if our results or those of [9] can be generalized to games with three or more actions.
While we prove our results for games on a path, they can be generalized to any tree for which the best response policies have compact representations as unions of rectangles.
While the problem of finding approximate Nash equilibria for various classes of games has  received a lot of attention in recent years, most of the existing work aims to find -Nash equilibria that satisfy (or are -close to  satisfying) certain properties.
Then checking if there is a Nash
