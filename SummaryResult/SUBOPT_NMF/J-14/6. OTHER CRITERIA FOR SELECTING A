If the algorithm succeeds in finding a Nash equilibrium s that satisfies EPVi (s ) ≥ T∗ − for all i = 1, .
Then if there exists a  strategy profile s such that s is a Nash equilibrium for G and Ti ≤ EPVi (s) ≤ Ti for i = 1, .
This observation allows us to approximate Nash equilibria in which all players" expected payoffs differ by at most ξ for any fixed ξ > 0.
It is not hard to check that for any p ∈ R , if there is a Nash equilibrium s such that mini=1 , ... , n
