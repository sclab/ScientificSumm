Another attractive solution concept is a Nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare.
In this paper, we show that if the underlying graph is a bounded-degree tree and the best response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient  algorithm which constructs a Nash equilibrium that guarantees certain payoffs to all participants.
In [9], it was shown that the best response policy has polynomial size as long as the underlying graph is a path.
These two algorithms can be combined to produce Nash equilibria that satisfy various fairness criteria.
We show that , while exactly computing the latter is
