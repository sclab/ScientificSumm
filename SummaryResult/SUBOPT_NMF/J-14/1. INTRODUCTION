A useful property of the data structure of [13] is that it  simultaneously represents the set of all Nash equilibria of the underlying game.
If this representation has polynomial size (as is the case for paths, as shown in [9]), one may hope to extract from it a Nash equilibrium with the desired properties.
Graphical games on bounded-degree trees have a simple  algebraic structure.
[9] showed how to find an (exact) Nash equilibrium in polynomial time when the underlying 162 graph has degree 2 (that is, when the graph is a collection of paths and cycles).
