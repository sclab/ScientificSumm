We discussed the properties of our framework showing how it can be used as a powerful communication-inherent mechanism for rewarding and sanctioning agent behaviour in open systems without compromising agent autonomy,  discussed its integration with agents" planning processes,  complexity issues, and presented a list of desiderata for the  design of ACLs with such semantics.
Thereby, our focus was on simplicity and on providing mechanisms for tracking semantic evolution in a  down-toearth, algorithmic fashion to ensure applicability to many different agent designs.
We then defined dynamic semantics as state transition systems over different semantic states that can be viewed as
