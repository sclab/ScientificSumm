∀ K ∈ Kt si such as sj ∈ SK : a. si communicates K to sj b. if sj acknowledges receipt of K, SK ← SK ∪ {sj}.
For an internal update, updating K depends on data(K): a candidacy C is modified when its modality changes and a request R is modified when an agent realizes it.
An internal update from si at time t ∈ T is  performed: - when knowledge K is created; - when data(K) is modified.
Let si be an agent in S. ∀t ∈ T: - ∀ sj ∈ Vicinity(si, t), si executes: 1.
