A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar  areas, and thus can communicate without the ground  intervention.
The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.
A minimum duration is necessary to move the mirror, so  requests that are too close together cannot be realized by the same satellite.
Intuitively , intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station ( and thus can communicate
