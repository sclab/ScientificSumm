Through the tuning of the strategies (α, and λ) and their plastic interlacing within the protocol, it is  possible to coordinate agents without additional communication: the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same between informed simulations and simulations implementing strategies.
Some simulations have been made to experimentally  validate these protocols and the first results are promising but raise many questions.
What is the trade-off between the constraint rate of the problem and the need of strategies?
To what extent are the number of redundancies and the  average cost affected by the tuning of the strategies?
Future works will focus
