Let At2 si be the plan generated at time t2 with t2 > t1.
A conflict is hard when the agents cannot communicate before the  realization of the request.
Consequently, conflict has to be defined: Definition 8 (Conflict).
Let si and sj (i < j) two agents in conflict with, at time t, candidacies Csi and Csj respectively (sCsi = si and sCsj = sj).
It is a matter of redundancies between allocations on a given request, i.e.
A conflict is soft if it exists a chain of agents between the two agents in conflict such as information can propagate before both agents
