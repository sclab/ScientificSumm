A request R is defined as a tuple < idR, pos(R), prio(R), tbeg(R),bR >: - idR is an identifier; - pos(R) is the geographic position of R; - prio(R) ∈ R is the request priority; - tbeg(R) ∈ T is the desired date of observation; - bR ∈ {true, false} specifies if R has been realized.
In the sequel , we will note Rt si the set of the requests that are known by agent si at time t ∈ T. For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value , noted costsi ( R )
