Likewise, we can notice that all politics reduce the average cost contrary to the first scenario.
Consequently, 3864 messages are exchanged in the worst case for the 40-request simulations and 7128 messages for the 74-request simulations.
The informed simulation reduces the number of redundancies but sligthly increases the  average cost for the same reason.
In the general case, using communication and strategies allows to reduce redundancies and saves resources but  increases the average cost: if a request is realized, agents that know it do not plan it even if its cost can be reduce  afterwards.
In the case of low
