When a literal L ∈ H contains variables, any instance of L is also an abducible.
, Ln appears in L1, .
Let P, H be an abductive program and G a conjunction as above.
An answer set is consistent if it is not Lit.
Suppose a program P and a set of literals S(⊆ Lit).
E and F are sets of ground literals such that E ⊆ H\P and F ⊆ H ∩ P. When ( P \ F ) ∪ E has an answer set S satisfying the above three conditions , S is called a belief set of
