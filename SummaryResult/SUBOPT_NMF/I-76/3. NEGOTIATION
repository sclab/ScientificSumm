Proceed to the step 4(b).
If Gi 1 = accept, an agreement is reached and  negotiation ends in success.
Note that an agent can construct counter-proposals by modifying its own previous proposals or another agent"s proposals.
(a) If Gi 1 violates an integrity constraint in P2, return the critique Gi 2 = reject to Ag1, together with the critique set CSi 2(P2, Gi 1).
(i) Produce Si c. Let μ(Si c) = { p | p ∈ Si c \ FPi 2 and p satisfies the constraints in CSi 1(P1, Gi−1 2 )}.
Let Pk , Hk be an abductive program
