The present  framework does not have a mechanism of selecting an optimal (counter-)proposal among different alternatives.
This enables us to realize automated negotiation on top of the existing answer set solvers.
We developed a negotiation protocol between two agents based on exchange of proposals and critiques, and provided  procedures for computing proposals in abductive logic  programming.
To  compare and evaluate proposals, an agent must have preference knowledge of candidate proposals.
Further elaboration to maximize the utility of agents is left for future study. 
It was shown that these two operations are used for general inference rules in producing proposals
