For instance, a buyer agent who runs out of credit may be forbidden to make further offers, or a seller agent is obliged to deliver after closing a deal.
However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.
Further on, in Section 4 we formalise the notion of conflict to subsequently analyse the complexity of conflict detection in terms of CPNs in Section 5.
