However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.
Within a NS, conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents" actions.
We show this by  formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets and borrowing well-known theoretical results from that field.
In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple , related activities , we propose a normative model , the Normative Structure ( NS ) , an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative
