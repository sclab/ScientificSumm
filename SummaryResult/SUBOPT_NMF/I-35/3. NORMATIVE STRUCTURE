Edges is a set Ain ∪ Aout where Ain ⊆ S × B is a set of input arcs labelled with an atomic formula using the labelling function Lin : Ain → D; and Aout ⊆ B × S is a set of output arcs labelled with a normative position using the labelling function Lout : Aout → N. The following must hold: 1.
Nodes is a set S∪B where S is a set of normative scenes and B is a set of normative transitions.
This layer is represented as a bi-partite graph that we term normative structure.
