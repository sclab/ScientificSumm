For  instance, an obligation obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) and a prohibition prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) are in conflict as they unify under σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T }).
In this paper we focus on prohibition/obligation  conflicts, but the computational machinery introduced in  Section 6.1 can equally be used to detect prohibition/permission inconsistencies, if we substitute modality obl for per. 
We formally capture this notion: Def.
That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under σ.
Therefore ,
