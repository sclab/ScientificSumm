Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection.
We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding.
Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current  stateof-the-art prediction techniques.
In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types.
To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted.
Consequently , our paper provides
