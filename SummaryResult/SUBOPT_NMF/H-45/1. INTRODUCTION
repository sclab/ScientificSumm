Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.
Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using WIG with the help of a query type classifier.
Query feedback and first rank change, which are our second and third prediction techniques, perform well for content-based queries and NP queries respectively.
Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.
