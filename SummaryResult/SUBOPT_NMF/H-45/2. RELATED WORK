The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.
The major difficulty of performance prediction comes from the fact that many factors have an impact on retrieval performance.
The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval.
The robustness score [1] quantifies another property of a ranked list: the robustness of the ranking in the presence of uncertainty.
In this paper , we mainly adopt the clarity score and the robustness score as our
