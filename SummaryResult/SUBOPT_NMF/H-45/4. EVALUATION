The remaining queries are used as training data.
We first decide the type of query Q according to a query classifier.
Prediction accuracy is measured by the accuracy of the binary decision.
Next we discuss how to implement our evaluation.
These results also demonstrate the strong adaptability of WIG to different query types.
Similar procedures will be taken for other prediction techniques.
We find that on average content-based queries have a much higher robustness score than NP queries.
