TIGRE is a project of the High Performance Computing across Texas (HiPCAT) [4] consortium.
These are bioscience and medicine, energy exploration and air quality modeling.
Within the energy exploration strategic application area, we have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [7] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the TIGRE environment and the GridWay [8] metascheduler.
Vision of the TIGRE project is to foster interdisciplinary and intercampus collaborations, identify novel approaches to extend academic-government-private partnerships, and become a competitive model for external funding opportunities.
The goal of HiPCAT is to support advanced
