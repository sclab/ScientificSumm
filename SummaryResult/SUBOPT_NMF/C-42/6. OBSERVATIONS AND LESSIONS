Also, there is a steep learning curve in Grid computing compared to the conventional cluster computing.
These efforts may result in increased collaborative research, educational opportunities, and workforce development through graduate/faculty research programs across TIGRE Institutions. 
Efforts are under way to involve more schools in this effort.
With respect to QoS, application researchers expect cluster level QoS with Grid environments.
Since Grid computing is still an emerging technology, and it spans over several administrative domains, Grid computing is still premature especially in terms of the level of QoS although, it offers better data security standards compared to commodity clusters.
