There are two main scenarios for comparing Grid and cluster computing approaches.
For resource information, see Table I.
Therefore, overall waiting time could be shorter in Grid approach which requests single CPU for each sub-job many times compared to MPI implementation that requests large number of CPUs at a single time.
When a job is submitted to GridWay, it will go through a series of dispatch (DM) and execution (EM) states.
However , parallelizability of the EnKF application depends on the number of ECLIPSE licenses and ideally , the number of licenses should be equal to the number of models
