Ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology is a popular approach for hydrocarbon reservoir simulations in energy exploration.
The Schlumberger ECLIPSE software is used for these simulations.
In this approach, an ensemble of geological models and production data of oil fields is used to forecast the dynamic response of oil wells.
Since models in the ensemble do not communicate, message-passing implementation is a good choice.
Each model checks out an ECLIPSE license and therefore, parallelizability of reservoir simulations depends on the number licenses available.
We have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology for the TIGRE Grid computing environment.
