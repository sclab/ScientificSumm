These single processor jobs were scheduled across TIGRE via GridWay metascheduler.
We have demonstrated that by pooling licenses across TIGRE sites, more geological models can be handled in parallel and therefore conceivably better simulation accuracy.
This task was accomplished by removing MPI code for parallel processing and replacing with single processor jobs one for each geological model in the ensemble.
Towards the future work, it would be interesting to compare the runtime between MPI, and Grid implementations for the EnKF application.
This approach has several advantages over MPI implementation especially when a site specific cluster is heavily loaded and/or the
