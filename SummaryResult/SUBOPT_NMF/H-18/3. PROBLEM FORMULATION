The goal is to find the  optimal topic segmentation and alignment mapping Segd(si) : {s1, s2, ..., snd } → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} and Alid(ˆsi) : {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp} → {ˆs1, ˆs2, ..., ˆsp}, for all d ∈ D, where ˆsi is ith segment with the constraint that only adjacent sentences can be mapped to the same segment, i.e.
{s1, s2, ..., snd }.
We evaluate the effect of it for topic segmentation.
Let Sd be the set of sentences for document d ∈ D, i.e.
Term co-clustering is a technique that has been employed [ 10 ] to improve
