Single-document topic segmentation is just a special case of the multi-document topic segmentation and alignment problem.
Topic alignment of multiple similar documents can be achieved by clustering sentences on the same topic into the same cluster.
Removing common stop words may result in the loss of useful  information in a specific domain.
We also introduce the new criterion of WMI based on term weights learned from  multiple similar documents, which can improve performance of topic segmentation further.
Section 3 contains a formulation of the problem of topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents with term co-clustering , a review of
