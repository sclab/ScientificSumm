It can find the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among  documents at the same time.
It also can handle single-document segmentation as a special case of the multi-document  segmentation and alignment.
The basic idea is that the optimal  segmentation maximizes MI(or WMI).
Our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term weights based on entropy learned from multiple documents.
Our approach can detect shared topics among documents.
Our experimental results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single-document segmentation ,
