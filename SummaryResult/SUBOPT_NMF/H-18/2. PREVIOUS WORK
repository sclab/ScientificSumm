There are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of  segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of  information from multiple documents.
Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].
While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others  utilize multiple documents [16, 14].
Text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.
Some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].
