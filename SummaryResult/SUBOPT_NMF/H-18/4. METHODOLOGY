First, a good guess of term weights can be made by using the distributions of term frequency along sentences for each document and averaging them to get the initial values of wˆt: wt = ( ED(t) maxt ∈T (ED(t )) )(1 − ES(t) maxt ∈T (ES(t )) ), (6) where ES(t) = 1 |Dt| d∈Dt (1 − s∈Sd p(s|t)log|Sd| 1 p(s|t) ), where Dt is the set of documents which contain Term t. Then, for the initial segmentation Seg(0) , we can simply segment documents equally by sentences.
