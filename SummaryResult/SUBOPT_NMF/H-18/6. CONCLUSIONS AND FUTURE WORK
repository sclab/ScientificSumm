We only tested our method on limited data sets.
Moreover, we also showed that doing  segmentation among multiple documents can improve the  performance tremendously.
More data sets especially complicated ones should be tested.
Our approach outperforms all the previous methods on  singledocument cases.
More previous methods should be compared with.
Our results also illustrated that  using weighted mutual information can utilize the information of multiple documents to reach a better performance.
We used dynamic programming to optimize our algorithm.
Moreover,  natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be used to find the optimal boundaries.
Supervised learning also can be
