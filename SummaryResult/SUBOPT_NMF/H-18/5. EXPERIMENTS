From the results we also found that in multi-document segmentation and alignment, most documents with missing segments and a reverse order are identified correctly.
We also tested WMIl with different hyper parameters of a and b to adjust term weights.
(3) Using term clustering usually gets worse results than MIl and WMIl.
First, because samples vote for the best multi-document segmentation and alignment, but if only two documents are compared with each other, the one with missing segments or a totally different sequence will affect the correct segmentation and alignment of the other.
Then for each pair of documents ,
