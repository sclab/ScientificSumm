For any A ⊆ [0, 1]2 , we define a function ˆfV by ˆfV (A) = {(f(u), v) | (v, u) ∈ A}; note that ˆfV maps subsets of [0, 1]2 to subsets of R×[0, 1].
For any w ∈ [0, 1], we have (w, 0) ∈ ˆf(0) if and only if 0 ∈ pbrV (w) and (w, 1) ∈ ˆf(1) if and only if 1 ∈ pbrV (w).
Similarly to the previous case , we can show that B ( W , V ) ∩ [ 0 , 1 ] × ( 0 , 1 )
