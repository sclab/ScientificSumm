This setting was first considered by Kearns, Littman and Singh, who  proposed a dynamic programming-based algorithm that computes all Nash equilibria of such games.
and computes all Nash equilibria in quadratic time if the input graph is a path, and in polynomial time if it is an arbitrary graph of maximum degree 2.
The running time of their algorithm is exponential, though approximate equilibria can be computed  efficiently.
Moreover, our algorithm can be used to compute Nash equilibria of graphical games on arbitrary trees, but the running time can be exponential, even when the tree has bounded degree.
