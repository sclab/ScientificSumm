Even when the tree has bounded degree, the running time can be  exponential.
There is an infinite family of graphical games on bounded-degree trees with pathwidth 2 such that any two-pass  algorithm for finding Nash equilibria on these trees requires  exponential time and space.
In Section 7, we give a complexity-theoretic intractability result for the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game on a graph with small pathwidth.
There is an O(n2 ) algorithm that finds a Nash equilibrium of a graphical game with two actions per player on an n-vertex path.
The generic algorithm does not
