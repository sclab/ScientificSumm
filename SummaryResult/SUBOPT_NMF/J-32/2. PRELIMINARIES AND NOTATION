This can be achieved by first choosing an arbitrary root of the tree, and then adding a dummy parent of this root, giving the new parent a constant payoff function.
The root selects any pair (w, v) from B(W, V ).
It decides to play mixed strategy w and it instructs V to play mixed strategy v. The remainder of the downward pass is recursive.
With the above assumptions about the root, the downstream pass is straightforward: Let W denote the root and V denote its child.
A mixed strategy is given by a single number x âˆˆ [ 0
