For this graph, the best response policy of a vertex Vk in the spine of the caterpillar is obtained by combining the best response  policy of its predecessor on the spine Vk−1 and its other child Tk; since the latter is a leaf, its best response policy is either trivial (i.e., [0, 1]2 , [0, 1]×{0}, or [0, 1]×{1}) or consists of two  horizontal segments and one vertical segment of the form {α}×[0, 1] that connects them.
If one can prove that this is always the case , it may be possible to adapt
