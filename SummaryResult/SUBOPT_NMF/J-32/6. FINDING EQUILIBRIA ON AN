Now, suppose it is true for B(Vk, Vk−1).
Let us examine them in turn.
To describe ˆf(0)∩[0, 1]×{0}, note that f(u, t) = .5t+.1u+.2 is monotone in t and u and satisfies f(0, 0) = .2.
We conclude that ˆf(0) ∩ [0, 1]×{0} = [0, .2]×{0}.
However, it turns out that for two-pass algorithms such as the algorithm of [8], the best response policy cannot be simplified.
It is easy to see that S1, S2, S3 ⊂ B(Vk+1, Vk).
For the inductive step , the main idea is
