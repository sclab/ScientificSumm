Each subset of vertices in the path decomposition is the vertices in a copy of Gshift.
There exists k such that for all n, and for all n1, n2, n3 ≤ n, there exists a graphical game of size O(n) with pathwidth k, having vertices V1, V2, V3 where p[V3] = p[V1] + 2−n3 (In1 p[V1] ∧ In2 p[V2]).
G has 3 players Vx, Vy and Vz for which p[Vx], p[Vy] and p[Vz] represent the coordinates of a point in the unit cube.
and comparing with P ( Si+1 ( 0n ) ) ,
