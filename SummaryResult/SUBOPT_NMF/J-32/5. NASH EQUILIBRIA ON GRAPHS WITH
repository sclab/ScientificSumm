Apply the upstream pass to P 4.
Check whether Vi+1 has any responses that are consistent with vi = b; if so we have a Nash equilibrium.
For an odd-length cycle all other vj "s are derivable from those solutions, and if a fully mixed Nash equilibrium exists, all the vj should turn out to be real numbers in the range (0, 1).
The values for vi that may occur in a Nash equilibrium are those for which all dependent vj values lie in ( 0 , 1 ) ; the latter condition is easy to check by computing the
