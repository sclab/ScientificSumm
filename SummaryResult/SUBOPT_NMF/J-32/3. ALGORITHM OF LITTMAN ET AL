, k, plays uj, and W plays w, and consider the set Wl = {w ∈ [0, 1] | ∃u ∈ [a, b] s.t.
The authors then claim that any such cover can be transformed into a breakpoint policy for V .
Suppose that U receives a  payoff of 1 if it plays differently to V and 0 otherwise.
Unfortunately, such a breakpoint policy may be exponential in size (see Figure 7) so the corrected algorithm does not run in polynomial time on all trees.
Any other trimming would be just as bad.
Note that this breakpoint policy ˆB ( W , V )
