Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.
Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.
Moreover, since Indri uses pseudo-relevance feedback while CAF´E uses feedback based on actual relevance judgments, the improvement in case of Indri is less dramatic than that of CAF´E. 
The NDCU for each system run is calculated  automatically.
These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set , and are calculated
