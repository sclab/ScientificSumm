For our experiments, we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the TDT4 corpus, with multiple queries per task.
We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty.
Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.
Our approach supports fine-grained user feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text, and leverages such information for utility optimization in adaptive settings.
Answer keys ( nuggets ) were generated for each query and
