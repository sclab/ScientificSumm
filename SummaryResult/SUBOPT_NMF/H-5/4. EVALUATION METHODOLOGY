of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.
The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage : U ( q ) = nX i=1 P ( i ) ∗ ( Gain ( pi , q ) − Loss ( pi , q ) ) ( 5 ) Note that if we
