the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step.
For training the model , we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class , and the user-highlighted pieces of text ( marked as Relevant or Not-relevant )
