[13] propose a compact representation of a word lattice called word  confusion network (WCN).
Each edge (u, v) is labeled with a word hypothesis and its posterior probability, i.e., the probability of the word given the signal.
The 1-best path of a WCN is obtained from the path  containing the best hypotheses.
One of the main advantages of WCN is that it also provides an alignment for all of the words in the lattice.

Traverse the word lattice , and align all the transitions with the pivot , merging the transitions that correspond to the same word
