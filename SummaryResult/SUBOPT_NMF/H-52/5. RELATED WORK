The retrieval is based on searching the string of phones representing the query in the phonetic  transcript.
The transcripts are indexed in the same manner as words in using classical text retrieval techniques; during query processing, the query is represented as a  sequence of phones.
[17] propose a model for spoken document retrieval using WCNs in order to improve the recall and the MAP of the search.
Consequently, phonetic approaches should be used only for OOV search; for  searching queries containing also IV terms, this technique affects the performance of the retrieval in comparison to the word based approach.
