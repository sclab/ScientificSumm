If the two players have conflicting preferences (e.g., A 1 B and B 2 A) then either (a).
t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 + b2 ≥ k. 2.
In a monotone mechanism, the allocation in such a row will be of the form [A, A, ..., B, B] (assuming that B 2 A).
A corollary from the proof of Theorem 1 is that the optimal 2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the players has only k − 1 different actions).
We say that the threshold xi
