66 Due to the linearity of expectation, the expected social value when player i with type θi reports bi is: X A∈A qA Eθ−i ( g(θi, θ−i, A) | t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A ) (1) = X A∈A qA Z θ−i g(θi, θ−i, A)fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) (2) where fA −i(θ−i) equals Q j=i fj (θj ) qA for types profiles θ−i such that t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A, and 0 otherwise.
The additive expected social-value depends on the length of the support of the type space.
Moreover, as discussed in [4], this bound is asymptotically tight.
