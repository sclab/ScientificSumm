Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal  informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.
And if not, to what  extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?
The implementability of the information-theoretically  optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal  socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.
That is , for some realizations of the players '' types , the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well
