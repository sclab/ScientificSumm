First, we characterize sufficient conditions under which the  information-theoretically optimal social-choice rule can be  implemented in dominant strategies, and prove that any  multilinear social-choice rule is dominant-strategy implementable with no additional cost.
Second, we identify necessary  conditions for the optimality of action-bounded mechanisms, and fully characterize the optimal mechanisms and strategies in games with two players and two alternatives.
Finally, we prove that for any multilinear social-choice rule, the optimal mechanism with k actions incurs an expected loss of O( 1 k2 ) compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted  action spaces.
Our results apply to various economic and computational settings
