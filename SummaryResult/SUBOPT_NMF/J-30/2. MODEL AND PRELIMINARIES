When the action space is discrete, the order can be determined by the names of the actions, for example, 0, 1,...,k-1 for k-action mechanisms.
Later on, we will use these orders for defining monotonicity of social-choice functions.
Assume that the valuation functions vi(Î¸i, A) are single crossing and that the action space is  unrestricted.
Throughout this paper, we assume that the valuation functions of the players are single-crossing, as defined below.
We define a k-action game to be a game in which the number of possible actions for each player is k , i.e. , |B| =
