In Figure 3(c), another node, H, has issued a query packet for the same file and obtained it from node B"s cache via node E. At this point, six nodes hold valid replicas and are connected through the validation mesh.
As a result, a validation mesh is established among nodes A, B, D, and G, as depicted in Figure 3(b).
As nodes update replicas, the node that last (or most recently) updates a 4 The 3rd International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications and Systems - Mobility 2006 corresponding replica assumes the role of focal node.
In particular
