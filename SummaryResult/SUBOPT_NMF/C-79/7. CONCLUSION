Specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing  protocols.
The paper describes a design paradigm that uses the functional primitives of positive/negative feedback and sporadic random walk to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs.
Either way, constructing an overlay will potentially suffer from the scalability problem.
In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be  discovered on demand.
On the other hand , if a proactive routing protocol is adopted , each peer has
