7DS [4], which is the pioneering work deploying P2P system on mobile devices, exploits data  locality and node mobility to dissemination data in a single-hop fashion.
Despite the mechanism to reduce control packets, high overhead may still be unavoidable, especially when there are many clients trying to locate different services, due to the fact that the algorithm relies on flooding, For resource replication, Yin and Cao [6] design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for MANETs.
Caching, however, is performed reactively by intermediate nodes when a querier requests data from a server.
Since data replication is triggered by the request frequency
