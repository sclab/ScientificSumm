Figure 4: Overhead vs. speed for 80 nodes Figure 5: Overhead vs. density Figure 6: Overhead vs. max #concurrent updates Figure 7: Overhead vs. freq.
In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.
The size of mesh doesn"t vary much on various densities, so that the overhead doesn"t vary much.
This is because the more quickly updates happen , ( 1 ) there will be more keep_alive message over
