The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).
From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raï¬„es Holdings plans.
Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas.
