All of the above methods can be  applied to time series data in general.
In this paper, we 1) first applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different event characteristics: important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic; 2) modeled aperiodic features with Gaussian density and periodic features with Gaussian mixture  densities, and subsequently detected each feature"s burst by the truncated Gaussian approach; 3) proposed an unsupervised greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.
We extensively evaluated our methods on the 1-year Reuters News Corpus [ 3 ] and showed that they were able to uncover
