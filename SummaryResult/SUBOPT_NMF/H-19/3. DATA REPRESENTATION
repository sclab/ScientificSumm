(Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.
The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3.
Definition 2.
(Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), .
We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.
Definition 1.
, yf ( T ) ] , where each element yf ( t ) is a measure of feature f at time t , which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf ( t
