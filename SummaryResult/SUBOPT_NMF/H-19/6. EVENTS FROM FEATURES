Specifically, we need to find a subset Ri of HH that minimizes the following cost function: C(Ri) = KL(Ri) d(Ri) fj ∈Ri Sfj , Ri ⊂ HH.
Given bursty feature fi ∈ HH, the goal is to find highly correlated  features from HH.
The UG algorithm allows a feature Algorithm 2 Unsupervised Greedy event detection (UG).
Accordingly, the DF Overlap among a set of features R is also defined.
Document Overlap Let Mi be the set of all documents containing feature fi.
8 : if C ( Ri ∪ fm ) < C ( Ri ) then 9 :
