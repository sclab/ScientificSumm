To address the real event detection problem, a simple and effective mixture density-based approach was used to identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods.
We also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to  detect both aperiodic and periodic events, which was successful in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real news stream.
The key idea of our work lies in the observations that (a)periodic events have (a)periodic representative features and (un)important events have (in)active representative  features, differentiated by their power spectrums and time  periods.
Although we have not made any benchmark comparison
