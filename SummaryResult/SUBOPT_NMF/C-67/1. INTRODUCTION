For example, each computer could be a web server for a web site.
The major objective of this computing model is to consolidate processing power over a network.
The last characteristic is the most fundamental to the grid described in this paper.
A fundamental grid feature is that it scales well.
In the most basic sense, grid turns a group of heterogeneous systems into a centrally managed but flexible computing environment that can work on tasks too time intensive for the individual systems.
Consequently , the grid computing model is gaining popularity and has become a show piece of ``
