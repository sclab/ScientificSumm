We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of  information while interacting with sentient objects.
Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.
Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.
As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 
Sentient objects accept input events from a
