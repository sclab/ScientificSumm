A problem will be to receive only the events of the robot which is closest.
If the guide detects that the distance grows, it slows down.
The local distance sensors produce events which are  disseminated through a low latency, highly predictable event channel.
Additionally, the robots have remote subscriptions to the respective  distance events which are used to check it with the local sensor readings to validate that they really follow the guide which they detect with their local sensors.
In the case of the guide robot , this information is directly delivered as a body event with a low
