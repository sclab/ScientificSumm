However, in these approaches the support for timeliness or  dependability issues does not exist or is only very limited.
A new scheme to integrate smart devices in a CORBA  environment is proposed in [17] and has lead to the proposal of a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) [26].
In [10] a real-time event system for CORBA has been introduced.
However, in contrast to the event channel model introduced in this paper, all  communication inside a cluster relies on a single technical solution of a synchronous communication channel.
They are targeted for the CAN-Bus [ 9 ] , a
