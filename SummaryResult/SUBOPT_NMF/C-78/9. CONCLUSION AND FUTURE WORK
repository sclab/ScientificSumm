The COSMIC middleware is a first attempt to put these concepts into operation.
Additionally, the provision of timing failure detection for the adaptation of interactions will be in the focus of our research.
Rather it should be  possible to control the flow of information by explicitly specifying functional and temporal dissemination constraints.
They connect the tiny sensors and actuators  perceiving the environment and providing sentience to the  application.
They can be verified at subscription and define a boundary for event dissemination.
One direction of future research will be the inclusion of real-world communication channels established between sensors and actuators in
