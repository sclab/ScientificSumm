The COSMIC middleware introduced in the next section is an approach to provide predictable event dissemination for a network of smart sensors and actuators. 
Thus we can assume temporal encapsulation similar to information hiding in the functional domain.
Because of that, quality attributes of an event clearly depend on higher level issues, such as the nature of the sentient object or of the smart sensor that produced the event.
â€¢ An observation of the environment as a time,value pair can be obtained with a bounded jitter in time.
Event dissemination through soft real-time channels in COSMIC exploits the temporal
