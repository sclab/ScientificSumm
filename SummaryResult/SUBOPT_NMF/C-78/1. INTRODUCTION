This view is complemented by  providing an outline of the component-based system construction and, in particular, by showing that it is possible to  compose larger applications from basic components, following an hierarchical composition approach.
This provides the necessary background to introduce the Generic-Events Architecture (GEAR), which describes the event-based interaction between the components via a generic event layer while allowing the seamless integration of physical and computer information flows.
This is  complemented by the notion of Event Channels (EC), which are  abstractions of the underlying network while being abstracted by the event layer.
In Section 3 we introduce the fundamental
