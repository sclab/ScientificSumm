The paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on events-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the  system.
The generic event architecture GEAR is  introduced which describes the event-based interaction between the components via a generic event layer.
It starts by an outline of the component-based system construction.
the interactions through the environment.
A crucial design decision is the choice of the appropriate abstractions and interaction mechanisms.
They are able to spontaneously disseminate information in response to events observed in the physical environment or to events
