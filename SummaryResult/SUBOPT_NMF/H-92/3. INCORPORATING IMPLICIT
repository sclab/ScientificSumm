This model requires a ranking algorithm to be robust to missing values: more than 50% of queries to web search engines are unique, with no previous implicit feedback available.
We now describe such a ranker that we used to learn over the combined feature sets including implicit feedback.
We now relax this assumption by integrating implicit feedback features directly into the ranking process.
For a given query q, the implicit score ISd is computed for each result d from available user interaction features, resulting in the implicit rank Id for each result.
An attractive feature of RankNet is both train-
