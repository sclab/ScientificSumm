One promising direction for future work is to apply recent research on automatically predicting query difficulty, and only attempt to incorporate implicit feedback for the difficult queries.
As another research direction we are exploring methods for extending our predictions to the previously unseen queries (e.g., query clustering), which should further improve the web search experience of users.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Chris Burges and Matt Richardson for an implementation of RankNet for our experiments.
We also thank Robert Ragno for his valuable suggestions and many discussions. 
Interestingly , implicit feedback is particularly valuable for queries with poor original ranking of results
