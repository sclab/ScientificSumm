For the special application of anti-manipulation,  DiffusionRank performs best both in reduction effects and in its stability among all the three algorithms. 
All these advantages can be achieved in the same computational complexity as  PageRank.
Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-group relations and to partition Web graph into small communities.
This anti-manipulation feature enables DiffusionRank to be a candidate as a  penicillin for Web spamming.
The experimental results show that we can actually achieve such a balance by  setting γ = 1, although the best setting including varying γi is still under further investigation.
We conclude that DiffusionRank is
