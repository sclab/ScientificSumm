In such a case 1/γ = 0,  DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation.
When γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored.
Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion  coefficient γ tends to infinity.
Consequently, γ is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of  preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation.
It is found empirically that , when γ = 1 , DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on
