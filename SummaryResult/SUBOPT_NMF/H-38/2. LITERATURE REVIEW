When the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1T + αA]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1T g = 1.
2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was  proposed.
While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images , the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [ 17
