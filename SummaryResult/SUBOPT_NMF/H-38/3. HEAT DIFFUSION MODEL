Suppose, at time t, each node i receives M(i, j, t, ∆t) amount of heat from its neighbor j during a period of ∆t.
The heat M(i, j, t, ∆t) should be proportional to the time period ∆t and the heat difference fj(t) − fi(t).
3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known , the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation : ∂f ( x , t ) ∂t − ∆f ( x , t ) = 0
