5.4 Approximation of PageRank We show that when γ tends to infinity, the value  differences between DiffusionRank and PageRank tend to zero.
According to the discussions in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4, we set the iteration number to be MB = 100 in DiffusionRank, and for accuracy consideration, the iteration number in all the algorithms is set to be 100.
(4) and Eq.
The trust set selection algorithm proposed in [7] is effective for both TrustRank and DiffusionRank.
We find that when γ = 1, the least order difference is achieved by  DiffusionRank.
