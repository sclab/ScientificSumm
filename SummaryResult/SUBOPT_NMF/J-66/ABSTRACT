We give a mixed-integer program formulation of the  clearing problem, and show that for concave bids, the program reduces to a linear program.
Also, it is not immediately clear how to make a donation conditional on other  donations to multiple charities, when the donator has different levels of appreciation for the different charities.
Subsequently , we show that the clearing problem is much easier when bids are quasilinear-for surplus , the problem decomposes across charities , and for payment maximization , a greedy approach is optimal if the bids are concave ( although this latter problem is weakly NP-complete when
