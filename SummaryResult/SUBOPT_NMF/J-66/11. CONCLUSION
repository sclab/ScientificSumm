We also showed that even though the clearing problem  decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.
We gave a mixed-integer program formulation of the clearing problem, and showed that for concave bids (where utility functions and payment willingness function are concave), the program reduces to a linear program and can hence be solved in polynomial time.
There are many directions for future research.
We then showed that the clearing problem for a subclass of concave bids is at least as hard as the decision variant of linear
