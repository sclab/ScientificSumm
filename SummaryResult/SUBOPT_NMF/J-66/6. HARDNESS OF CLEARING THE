For each bv, either c+v or c−v receives at least 2, so this bidder"s threshold has been met.
Finally, because the total amount received by the charities is 2|V | + T 8|V ||K| , b0"s threshold has also been met.
First, suppose there exists a solution to the MAX2SAT instance.
For, this would require that πc+v + πc−v ≥ 4.
Finally, all the other bids combined can contribute at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| + 1 4 + 1 16|V ||K| < 1.
If bk is accepted , at least one of cl1 k and cl2 k must be receiving at least
