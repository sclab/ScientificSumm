Let the target total amount donated be 2vH.
Let H be some number such that if there is a feasible solution to the LP, there is one in which every variable has absolute value at most H. In the following, we will represent bids as follows: ({(ck, ak)}, s, t) indicates that uk j (πck ) = akπck (this  function is 0 for ck not mentioned in the bid), and wj(uj) = t for uj ≥ s, wj(uj) = uj t s otherwise.
For every variable xi in the LP, let there be two charities, c+xi and c−xi .
This allows us to
