The resulting solution is certainly valid: first of all, at least as much money is collected as is given away, because bj πbj − ci πci = bj ci πbi j − ci πci = ci (( bj πbi j ) − πci )-and the terms of this summation are the objectives of the individual optimization problems, each of which can be set at least to 0 (by setting all the variables are set to 0), so it follows that the expression is nonnegative.
Because in an optimal solution , we will extract as much payment from the bidders as possible given the πci
