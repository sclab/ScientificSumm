The first bidder bids u1 1(πc1 ) = 1 if πc1 ≥ 1, u1 1(πc1 ) = 0 otherwise; u2 1(πc2 ) = 1 if πc2 ≥ 1, u2 1(πc2 ) = 0 otherwise; and w1(u1) = u1 if u1 ≤ 1, w1(u1) = 1+ 1 100 (u1 −1) otherwise.
10.3 Impossibility of efficiency In this subsection, we show that even in a very restricted setting, and with minimal requirements on IC and IR  constraints, it is impossible to create a mechanism that is  efficient.
The next proposition shows that this is indeed the case.
There exist settings with two charities where there exists
