Let [xt i, yt i ] denote the offer made at time period t where xt i and yt i denote the share for agent a and b respectively.
We then present a time efficient approximate equilibrium. 
Since a makes an offer at t = 1 and the agents use the alternating offers protocol, the offering agent for the last time period is b if n is even and it is a if n is odd.
If it accepts, negotiation ends in an agreement with a getting xi and b getting yi = 1 âˆ’ xi.
Hence we have a single discount factor
