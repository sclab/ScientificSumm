Finally, we extended the analysis to online negotiation where the issues  become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about the features of these issues.
We also analysed the difference between the true optimum and the approximate optimum.
These strategies have polynomial time complexity.
Specifically, we showed that an approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and analysed the approximation error.
We then presented approximately optimal negotiation  strategies and showed that they form an equilibrium.
These approximate strategies also have polynomial time complexity.
There are several interesting directions for future work.
In future , it will be interesting
