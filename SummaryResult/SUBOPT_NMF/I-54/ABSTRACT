We also analyze the relative error (i.e., the difference between the true optimum and the approximate).
Finally, we extend the analysis to online  negotiation where different issues become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
There are m > 1 issues for negotiation where each issue is viewed as a pie of size one.
In order to  overcome this computational complexity, we then present negotiation strategies that are approximately optimal but computationally  efficient, and show that they form an equilibrium.
The time complexity of the approximate equilibrium strategies is O ( nm/
