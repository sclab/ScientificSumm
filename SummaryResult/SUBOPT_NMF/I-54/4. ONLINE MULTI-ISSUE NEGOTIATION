However, finding an agent"s BNE strategy is analogous to solving the online 0-1 knapsack problem.
The agent must examine the m items one at a time according to the order they are input (i.e., as their profit and size coefficients become known).
Hence, the algorithm is required to decide whether or not to  include each item in the knapsack as soon as its weight and profit become known, without knowledge concerning the items still to be seen, except for their total number.
A threshold value is determined on the basis of the information regarding weights and profits for
