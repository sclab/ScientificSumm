An equally important problem, especially in the context of software agents, is to find the time  complexity of computing the equilibrium offers.
For example, consider the case of task allocation between two agents.
Deadlines are an essential element since negotiation cannot go on indefinitely, rather it must end within a reasonable time limit.
Also, agents typically have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors.
An issue, in its entirety, must be allocated to either of the two agents.
For this case , we show that the problem of finding the equilibrium offers is NP-hard ,
