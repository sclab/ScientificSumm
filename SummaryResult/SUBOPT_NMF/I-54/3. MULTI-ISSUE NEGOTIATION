Hence we use these methods to find a solution to our  negotiation problem.
At this stage, we would like to point out the main difference between solving the 0-1 knapsack problem and solving our negotiation problem.
THEOREM 2.
In this approach, a strategy profile is said to form an approximate Nash equilibrium if neither agent can gain more than the constant by deviating.
This problem is analogous to the negotiation problem we want to solve (i.e., the maximization problem of Equation 3).
4 Note that for the standard 0-1 knapsack problem the weights , profits and the capacity are positive
