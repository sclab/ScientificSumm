These  workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.
We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.
In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm [ 5 ] to find the best assignment of web service
