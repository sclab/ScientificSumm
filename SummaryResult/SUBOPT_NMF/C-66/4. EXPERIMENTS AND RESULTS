These figures show the percentage of workflows that are successful (can complete with their QoS limit), acceptable (can complete within κ=3 times their QoS limit), and failed (cannot complete within κ=3 times their QoS limit).
To better understand the behaviour resulting from the scheduling assignments, we show the workflow completion results in Figures 5, 6, and 7 for 100, 500, and 900 workflows, respectively.
Indeed, the makespan is oblivious to the fact that we provide multiple levels of  completion (successful, acceptable, and failed) and assign business value scores accordingly.
As can be seen , the GA consistently produces the
