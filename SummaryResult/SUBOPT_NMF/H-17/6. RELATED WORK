Query-dependent relevance can be calculated in a variety of ways (see [3, 30]).
[32] presents a generic framework for computing approximate top-k answers with some probabilistic bounds on the quality of results.
Since our work does not assume a particular form of ranking function, it is complementary to this body of work.
Similarly, there are a number of works that measure the quality of the documents,  typically as captured through link-based analysis [17, 28, 26].
Our work essentially extends [1, 2, 4, 7, 20, 27, 31] by proposing mechanisms for providing the correctness guarantee to the computed top-k results.
