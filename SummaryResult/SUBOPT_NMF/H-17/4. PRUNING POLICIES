The hope is that most of the top-ranked results are likely to have high pr(D) values, so the answer computed from this p-index is likely to be similar to the  answer computed from the full index.
In the figure, we vertically prune postings corresponding to D4, D5 and D6 of t1 and D8 of t3, assuming that these documents are unlikely to be part of top-k answers to user queries.
then P(computer) = 0.1.
Figure 7 describes this pruning policy more formally , where we sort all documents Di '' s by their respective pr ( Di ) values
