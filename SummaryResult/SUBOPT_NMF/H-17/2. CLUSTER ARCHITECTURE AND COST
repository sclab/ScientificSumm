and every copy of an index (both the full IF and p-index IP ) can handle up to 1000 queries/sec.
, tn}, [i, i + k]) where {t1, .
For the 2nd tier, since 20% (or 1000 queries/sec) are forwarded, we need to maintain one copy of IF to handle the load.
In the cases where a p-index cannot compute the answer (e.g.
However , the two-tier architecture may have a significant drawback in terms of its result quality compared to the full replication of IF ; given the fact that the p-index contains only a subset of the data of the full
