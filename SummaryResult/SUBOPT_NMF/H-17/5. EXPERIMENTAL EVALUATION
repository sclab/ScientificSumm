Our  observation is that, if we would have to pick one of the two pruning policies, then the two policies seem to be more or less equivalent for the p-index sizes s â‰¤ 20%.
In our next experiment, we are interested in comparing EKS with the PR-based pruning policies described in Section 4.3.
We have performed the experiment for varying index sizes s and the result is shown in Figure 12.
