Our contribution is a  number of modifications in the pruning techniques for creating the pruned index and a new result computation algorithm that  guarantees that the top-matching pages are always placed at the top search results, even though we are computing the first batch from the pruned index most of the time.
We also show how to determine the optimal size of a pruned index and we experimentally evaluate our algorithms on a collection of 130 million Web pages.
