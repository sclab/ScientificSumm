In Figure 3, we show an example graph of f(s) over s. Given the notation, we can state the problem of p-index-size  optimization as follows.
We use s to denote the size of the p-index relative to IF (i.e., if s = 0.2, for example, the p-index is 20% of the size of IF ).
But now, suppose that if we prune IF by 75% to IP 1 (i.e., the size of IP 1 is 25% of IF ), IP 1 can handle 40% of the queries (i.e., C = 1 for 40% of the queries).
