We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.
More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web  communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.
Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.
The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm , and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos
