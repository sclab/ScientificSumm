In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.
One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 
Current system is far from being perfect.
We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.
Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking , the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds
