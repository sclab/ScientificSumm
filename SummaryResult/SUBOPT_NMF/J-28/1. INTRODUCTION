Section 3 provides the generalized knapsack formulation for the multi-unit allocation problems and introduces the fully polynomial time approximation scheme.
The approximate VCG mechanism is ( ε 1+ε )-strategyproof for an approximation to within (1 + ) of the optimal allocation.
We compute  approximate VCG payments in worst-case time O(αT log(αn/ε)), where α is a constant that quantifies a reasonable no-monopoly assumption.
1.1 Related Work There has been considerable interest in recent years in  characterizing polynomial-time or approximable special cases of the general combinatorial allocation problem, in which there are  multiple different items.
