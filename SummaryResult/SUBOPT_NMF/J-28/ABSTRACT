Second, we embed this approximation scheme within a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and compute payments to n agents for an  asymptotic cost of O(T log n).
General Terms Algorithms, Economics. 
The maximal possible gain from  manipulation to a bidder in the combined scheme is bounded by /(1+ )V , where V is the total surplus in the efficient outcome.
First , we develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the multi-unit allocation problem , which computes a ( 1 +
