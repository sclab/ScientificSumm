Otherwise, then the efficient  outcome is no trade, and the outcome of the VCG mechanism is no trade and no payments.
Again, in equilibrium each seller"s payoff is exactly the marginal-value that the seller contributes to the economic efficiency of the  system; in the simple case that V ≥ C(I \ i) for all sellers i, this is precisely C(I \ i) − C(I).
determination problem in the reverse auction is to determine the allocation, x∗ , that minimizes the cost to the buyer, or forfeits trade if the minimal cost is greater than value, V .
This problem
