Since we wish to minimize the total cost, we consider the tuples in order of increasing per unit cost.
Consider the set Skip at the termination of Greedy( , j).
If size(tk i ) is greater than R, then S along with tk i forms a feasible solution.
Since this tuple can be taken fractionally, we update Best if the sum of S"s cost and fractional cost of t is an improvement.
Because t âˆˆ Skip then size ( t ) > R , and St together with t forms a feasible solution , and we have : V
