From earlier, we define cost(A−i ) = C(I \ i).
We have: cost(A−i ) = cost(xi) + cost(x−i) + pj xj Let ri = scost(xi) and r−i = scost(x−i).
4.2 Improved Approximation Scheme Our improved approximation scheme for the winner-determination problem without agent i uses the fact that elements in F (i − 1) and B (n − i) are sorted; specifically, both, unscaled cost and quantity (i.e.
5, and  eventually to compute the VCG payments.
From Lemma 3 we conclude that , cost ( yi ) + cost ( y−i ) − cost ( xi ) − cost ( x−i )
