The advantage of our scheme is that agents can be viewed as black-boxes that provide incremental information about their valuations.
[19] consider the problem of learning restricted classes of valuation functions which can be represented using read-once formulas and Toolbox DNF.
Finally, we use our conversion procedure to generate combinatorial auction protocols from learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone DNF, and linear-threshold functions.
Since their work is also grounded in learning theory, they allow dependence on the size of the target  valuation as we do (though read-once valuations can always be succinctly represented anyway).
They consider models with membership and equivalence
