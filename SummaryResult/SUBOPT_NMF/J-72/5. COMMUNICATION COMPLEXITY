Thus communicating the manifest valuation requires size at most p(size(vi), m), for some polynomial p that upper-bounds the runtime of the efficient learning algorithm.
Representing the surplus πi to agent i cannot require space greater than q(size(˜vi), m) for some fixed polynomial q, because we assume that the chosen representation is polynomially interpretable, and thus any value generated will be of polynomial size.
These bounds can be translated to explicit bounds on the number of value and demand queries made by the resulting elicitation algorithm.
