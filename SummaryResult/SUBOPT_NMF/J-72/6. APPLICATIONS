For each item i in T, we have v(T) = v(T − {i}).
Otherwise leave T as is and proceed to the next item.
Now assume v(T) = v(T − {i}).
Create a  bundle T as follows.
Nisan [11] notes that XOR bids can represent the single-item valuation with m atomic bids, but 2m − 1 atomic bids are needed to  represent the additive valuation.
These insights allow us to generalize a classic learning algorithm for monotone DNF ([3] Theorem 6 Note that Theorem 1 applies even if valuations do not  satisfy free-disposal.
Recall that an XOR bid
