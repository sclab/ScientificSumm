Suppose an agent replies with a preferred  bundle S when proposed a bundle S and supporting Lindahl prices p(S) (supporting with respect to the the agent"s  manifest valuation).
We say that the Lindahl prices support the optimal allocation.
Note that a demand query with maximal Lindahl prices is almost identical to an equivalence query, since in both cases we communicate the manifest valuation to the agent.
The agent"s manifest valuations are in fact valid Lindahl prices, and we refer to them as maximal Lindahl prices.
, Sn ) is an optimal allocation if and only
