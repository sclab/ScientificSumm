To  determine the value of a bundle S given these bids, one searches for the bundle S of highest value listed in the atomic bids such that S ⊆ S. It is then the case that v(S) = v(S ).
In this language, the agent provides a list of atomic bids, which consist of a bundle together with its value.
More formally , a representation class ( bidding language ) C is polynomially interpretable if there exists an algorithm that given as input some v ∈ C and an instance x ∈ X computes the value v ( x )
