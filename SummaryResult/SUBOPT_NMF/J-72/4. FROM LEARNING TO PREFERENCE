, An are all polynomial-query learning algorithms.
Thus an optimal allocation has been found.
Rather, it elicits partial information about the valuations through value queries, and periodically tests whether enough  information has been gathered by proposing an allocation to the agents through demand queries.
Consider the elicitation algorithm in Figure 1.
Because of our Lindahl price construction, when all agents reply ‘YES" to a demand query, we have found an optimal  allocation, analogous to the case where an agent replies ‘YES" to an equivalence query when the target function has been exactly learned.
The procedure performs a polynomial number
