Total value is non-decreasing in q for q ≤ 1 and non-increasing in q for q ≥ 1.
Agents s and t, where s is initially ranked lower than t, are swapped in the process if and only if the following conditions hold: eq svs ≤ eq t vt eq+ s vs > eq+ t vt which together imply that es > et and hence es > et as > 0.
If agents s and t are swapped, where s was initially ranked lower than t, then es > et.
