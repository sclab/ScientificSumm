Larger classes of ranking rules could be relevant.
There are several ways to push this research further.
However, many  allocations can arise in Nash equilibrium, and a linear program needs to be solved for each of these.
In the simulations, the revenue improvements were greater than what could be obtained using reserve prices.
For  instance, it is possible to introduce discounts ds and rank  according to wsbs âˆ’ ds; the equilibrium analysis generalizes to this case as well.
With appropriate estimates for the distributions of value and relevance , and knowledge of their correlation , the revenue curve can then
