Lemma 1.
Note that it covers rank-by-bid (q = 0) and rank-by-revenue (q = 1) as special cases.
To see how tuning q can improve matters, consider again the equilibrium revenue: R(q) = KX s=1 KX t=s „ et+1 es «q es(xt − xt+1)vt+1.
Note that the total payment of agent s in equilibrium is esxs ws+1 ws bs+1 = KX t=s es(xt − xt+1) wt+1 ws vt+1 = esxsvs − Z vs 0 KX k=1 esxkQsk(es, e−s, y, v−s; w) dy.
It then follows from ( 7 ) that q = 0 will yield more revenue in equilibrium than
