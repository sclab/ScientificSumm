Then in a symmetric equilibrium, we have esxs „ vs − ws+1 ws csbs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws csbt+1 « or equivalently xs „ ws cs vs − ws+1bs+1 « ≥ xt „ ws cs vs − wt+1bt+1 « .
If we define ws = ws cs and bs = csbs, we recover  inequality (3).
Hence the equilibrium revenue will be as if we had used weights w rather than w. The bids will be scaled  versions of the bids that arise with weights w (and no credits), where each bid is scaled by the corresponding factor 1/cs.
