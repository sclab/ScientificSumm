The curves level off as q → +∞ because eventually agents are ranked purely according to relevance, and similarly as q → −∞.
The trends in efficiency and relevance are as described in the results from Section 6.
7 A copula is a function that takes marginal distributions and gives a joint distribution with these marginals.
The empirical distributions of value and relevance together with the fitted lognormal and beta curves are given in  Figure 1.
