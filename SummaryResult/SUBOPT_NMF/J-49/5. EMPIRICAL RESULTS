*Best value for each metric is shown in bold.
Using this empirical distribution, we are then able to evaluate that at what confidence level the observed  difference reflects a real difference.
All four opinion pools correctly  predict a similar number and percentage of games as NF and TS.
For example, the mean absolute error of NF is higher than that of Log-All-u by 0.0229, as shown in Table 3.
We then take a closer look at prediction accuracy of  information markets and opinion pools using the three  performance measures.
We use all of the three to stand for the performance
