Axiomatic  approaches are easy to use.
One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].
They are combined through various  mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability  distribution.
Using LinOP, the aggregate probability  distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual  probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert i"s probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability  distribution, wi"s are weights for experts, which are usually  nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.
These pooling functions are
