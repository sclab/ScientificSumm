Experimental results show that the outranking method significantly out-performs popular classical positional data fusion methods like combSUM and combMNZ strategies.
Indeed, it ranks two documents w.r.t.
From the  experiments, we can also conclude that in order to improve the performances, we should fuse result lists of well performing IR models, and that majoritarian data fusion methods  perform better than positional methods.
We propose a new outranking method for rank  aggregation which is well adapted to the IR context.
It also out-performs a good performing majoritarian methods which is the Markov chain method.
