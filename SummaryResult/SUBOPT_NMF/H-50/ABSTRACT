Experimental results are reported showing that the suggested method performs better than the well-known CombSUM and CombMNZ operators.
We show that the proposed method deals well with the Information Retrieval distinctive features.
In this context, we propose a rank aggregation method within a multiple criteria framework using  aggregation mechanisms based on decision rules identifying positive and negative reasons for judging whether a document should get a better rank than another.
