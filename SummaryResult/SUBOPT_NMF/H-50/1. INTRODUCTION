[3] also found that rank aggregation methods improve the performances w.r.t.
those of the input methods, even when some of them have weak individual performances.
Most current rank aggregation methods consider each  input ranking as a permutation over the same set of items.
This corresponds indeed to the reality, where only ordinal information is available.
For instance, experiments carried out in [16], [30], [4] and [19] showed that documents which appear in the lists of the majority of the input methods are more likely to be relevant.
Data fusion has recently been proved to improve performances for both the ad-hoc
