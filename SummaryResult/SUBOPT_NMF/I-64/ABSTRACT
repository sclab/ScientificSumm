We then evaluate our approach against the contract-net approach and show that our OSD agents perform better, are more efficient, and more flexible to changes in the environment.
We extend the existing OSD approach to include  worthoriented domains, model other resources in addition to only  processor resources and build in robustness into the organization.
Organizational-Self Design (OSD) has been proposed as an  approach for constructing suitable organizational structures at  runtime.
On the other hand , for many real environments , the problems are not
