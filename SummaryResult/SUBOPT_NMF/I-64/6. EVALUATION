The response time of a task is defined as the difference between the time at which any agent in the organization starts working on the task (the start time) and the time at which the task was generated (the generation time).
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1233 experiments in which the generated task structures were  unsatisfiable (given the deadline constraints), were removed from the final results.
The average response time of the organization.
Hence, all the experiments in an experimental set had the same values for the exogenous variables that were used to control the experiment.
