For example, both TDT5SU and T11SU are positively correlated to the values of A and D, and negatively correlated to the values of B and C; the only difference between them is in their penalty ratios for misses vs. false alarms, i.e., 10:1 in TDT5SU and 2:1 in T11SU.
The Ctrk function, on the other hand, is positively correlated to the values of C and B, and negatively correlated to the values of A and D; hence, it is negatively correlated to T11SU and TDT5SU.
To distinguish this from the 5.011 =Î²SUT in TREC11 , we call former TDT5SU in
