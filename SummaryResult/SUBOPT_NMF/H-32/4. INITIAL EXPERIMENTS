Every question is scored on nugget recall (NR) and nugget  precision (NP) and a single final score is computed using F-Measure (see equation 1) with Î² = 3 to emphasize nugget recall.
We compare the results attained by the Human Interest Model that only identify interesting nuggets with the results of the syntactic pattern finding Soft-Pattern model as well as the result of the top performing definitional system in TREC 2005 [13].
This result is confirmation that interesting nuggets does indeed play a significant role in picking up definitional answers , and may be more vital than using information finding lexical
