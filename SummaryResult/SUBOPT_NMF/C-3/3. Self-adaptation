The badness of a processor is determined by the following formula: proc badnessi = α ∗ 1 speedi + β ∗ ic overheadi + γ ∗ inW orstCluster(i) The processor is considered bad if it has low speed ( 1 speed is big) and high inter-cluster overhead (ic overhead).
The coordinator always tries to remove the worst processors.
The lower the  efficiency, the more nodes are removed.
Therefore, the application will be migrated from overloaded resources.
If necessary, the adaptation component will try to add other resources.
When it exceeds Emax, the  coordinator requests new processors from the scheduler.
