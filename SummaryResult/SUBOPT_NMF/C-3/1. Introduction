During the application run, we periodically collect  information about the communication times and idle times of the  processors.
Next, we adjust the resource set the application is running on by adding or removing compute nodes or even entire clusters.
It handles all of the following cases : • automatically adapting the number of processors to the degree of parallelism in the application , even when this degree changes dynamically during the computation • migrating ( part of ) a computation away from overloaded resources • removing resources with poor communication links that slow down the computation • adding new resources
