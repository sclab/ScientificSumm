The badness of the nodes is defined by a heuristic formula.
Further research is also needed to decrease the benchmarking overhead.
For  example, the node badness formula could be refined at runtime based on the effectiveness of the previous adaptation decisions.
Our approach also allows the application to adapt to the changing grid conditions.
Existing approaches to these  problems typically assume the existence of a performance model that allows predicting application runtimes on various sets of resources.
If the weighted  average efficiency drops below a certain level, the adaptation  coordinator starts removing worst nodes.
This , however , requires grid
