Processor clock speed, average load and a number of  processors in a cluster (Cactus) are used to rank resources and the  resource with the highest rank is selected.
The application is migrated if performance degradation is detected or better resources are  discovered.
In the context of this project, a number of applications were studied and performance models for these applications were created.
Based on such a model a scheduling agent is built that uses the performance model to select the best resource set and the best application schedule on this set.
As the number of available grid resources increases ,
