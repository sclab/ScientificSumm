The first assumption we make is that the application is  malleable, i.e., it is able to handle processors joining and leaving the on-going computation.
However, we believe that our methodology can be used for other types of applications as well.
Also, master-worker applications typically use dynamic load-balancing strategies (e.g., MW - a framework for writing  gridenabled master-worker applications (12)).
In this section we summarize the assumptions about applications that are  important to our approach.
We find it a reasonable assumption for a grid application , since applications for which the slowest processor becomes a bottleneck will not be able to efficiently
