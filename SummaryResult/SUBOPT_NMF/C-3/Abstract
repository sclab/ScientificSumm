We evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the Grid.
We start an application on any set of resources.
Then, we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs.
This approach  allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded WAN links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant performance improvements.
Existing solutions to these two problems require that a  performance model for an application is known.
During the application run, we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and  deduce application requirements from these statistics.
