, ( d, pm−1, [tm−1, tm)) ) , that adheres to the following constraints: First, O and I must cover the same time-range, i.e., ti = tj and tn = tm.
In other words, if (d, pi, [ti, ti+1)) and (d, pj, [tj, tj+1)) are postings of I and O respectively, then the following must hold for a chosen error function and a threshold : tj ≤ ti ∧ ti+1 ≤ tj+1 ⇒ error(pi, pj) ≤ .
Exploiting this fact, an optimal solution is computable by means of induction [24] in O(n2 ) time.
, ( d, pn−1, [tn−1, tn)) ) .
Approximate temporal coalescing reduces the number of postings in
