We introduce approximate temporal coalescing as a tunable method to reduce the index size without  significantly affecting the quality of results.
In order to further improve the performance of time-travel queries, we  introduce two principled techniques to trade off index size for its performance.
These techniques can be formulated as  optimization problems that can be solved to near-optimality.
Results unequivocally show that our methods make it  possible to build an efficient time machine scalable to large versioned text collections.
Finally, our approach is evaluated in a comprehensive  series of experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets.
As a consequence , there
