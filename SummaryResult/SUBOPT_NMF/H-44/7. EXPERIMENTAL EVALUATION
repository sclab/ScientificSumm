(ii) Kendall"s τ (see [7, 14] for a detailed definition) at  cutoff level k (KT@k), measuring the agreement between two results in the relative order of items in Gk ∩ Ck, with value 1 (or -1) indicating total agreement (or disagreement).
We used the following two measures for  comparison: (i) Relative Recall at cutoff level k (RR@k), that measures the overlap between Gk and Ck, which ranges in [0, 1] and is defined as RR@k = |Gk ∩ Ck|/k .
= 0.01, has a considerable effect by reducing the index size almost by an order of magnitude.
