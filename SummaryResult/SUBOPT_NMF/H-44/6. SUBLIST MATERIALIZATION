In the example  illustrated in Figure 2 materialized sublists for [t1, t2) and [t2, t3) differ only by one posting.
Popt and Sopt are extremes: the former provides the best possible performance but is not space-efficient, the latter requires minimal space but does not provide good  performance.
In detail , the technique , which we refer to as PG ( Performance Guarantee ) in the remainder , finds a set M that has minimal required space , but guarantees for any elementary time interval [ ti , ti+1 ) ( and thus for any query q t with t âˆˆ
