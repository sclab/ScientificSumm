Putting all this together, we define the state Dt of the collection at time t (i.e., the set of versions valid at t that are not deletions) as Dt = [ d∈D {dti ∈ d | t ∈ val(dti ) ∧ dti = ⊥} .
As a retrieval model in this work we adopt Okapi BM25 [27], but note that the proposed techniques are not dependent on this choice and are applicable to other retrieval models like tf-idf [4] or language models [26] as well.
