First, we prove for the case where v is between u and w. From lemma 8, there are compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCuv ab , (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
On the other hand, for every (b, c)-path −→a = (b = a1, a2, .
Now for any b, c ∈ A and any (b, c)-path −→a with C(−→a ) = ∅, let −→u ∈ C(−→a ).
For ( a , b , c ) ∈ S , the restriction of f to the compact set Rabc attains a minimum m ( a , b , c ) at some point (
