Thus for each v ∈ DC − D, there is an a = a(v) ∈ A such that v ∈ (f−1 (a))C .
Extend f to the function g on DC by defining g(v) = a(v) for v ∈ DC − D and g(v) = f(v) for v ∈ D. It is easy to check that δab(g) = δab(f) for all a, b ∈ A and therefore it suffices to show that the nonnegative two-cycle property for g implies the nonnegative cycle property for g. Henceforth we assume D is convex and closed. 
We first reduce the
