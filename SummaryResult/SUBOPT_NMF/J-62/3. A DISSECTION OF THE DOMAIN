Let Ra = {v : ∀b ∈ A, v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab}.
Clearly, Da is closed and convex, and contains f−1 (a).
If v ∈ Ra ∩Rb then v(a)− v(b) = δab = −δba.
Finally, we restrict the collection of sets {Ra : a ∈ A} to the domain D by defining Da = Ra ∩ D for each a ∈ A.
Ra is a closed polyhedron containing f−1 (a).
Therefore S a∈A Da = D. Also, by proposition 5, any point v in Da ∩ Db satisfies v(a) − v(b) = δab = −δba. 
The next proposition implies that any
