By definition, D must be a set of functions from Sn to R. For λ ∈ Sn, the domain element yλ : Sn −→ R is defined by yλ(α) = λT Mα.
The range of our social choice function will be the set Sn and the domain D will be indexed by Sn, that is D = {yλ : λ ∈ Sn}, where yλ is defined below.
We claim that Gf satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle  property (W-MON) but has a negative cycle (and hence is not truthful).
