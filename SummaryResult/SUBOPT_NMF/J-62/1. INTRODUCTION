1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of  truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.
Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based, i.e., defined by order constraints and zero constraints, and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] extended this to other domains.
Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain,  every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain.
This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful functions
