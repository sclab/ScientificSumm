For a D-sequence −→u , we write ord(u) for the order of −→u .
A compatible pair is a pair (−→a , −→u ) where −→a is a path and −→u is a D-sequence satisfying ord(−→u ) = |−→a | and for each i ∈ [k], both ui−1 and ui belong to Dai .
Let −→u be a D-sequence in C(−→a ) ∩ C(−→a ).
D-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is compatible with both path (a, b, c, e) and path (a, b, d, e); D-sequence (v, w, u, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (a, b, d, e).
