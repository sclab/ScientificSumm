Let us say that a set D of P Ã— A real valuation matrices is a WM-domain if any social choice function on D  satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful.
It is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set D of real  matrices is a WM-domain.
In this paper, we showed that for finite A, any convex D is a WM-domain.
We believe that convexity is the main part of the story, i.e., a WM-domain is, after excluding some exceptional cases, essentially a convex set.
Typically , the domains of social choice functions considered in mechanism design
