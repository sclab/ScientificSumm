, ut) such that −→u and −→u are both subsequences of −→u , i.e., there are indices 0 = i0 < i1 < · · · < ik = t and 0 = j0 < j1 < · · · < jl = t such that −→u = (ui0 , ui1 , .
We now construct a (b, c)-path −→a ∗ compatible with −→u such that δ(−→a ∗ ) = δ(−→a ).
It follows immediately that (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
Let S be a minimal subset of A satisfying ∪s∈SIs = vw.
For each s ∈ S , Is is maximal , i.e. , not contained in any other It , for t ∈ S. In
