Experimental results have shown that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual IR model yields significant improvements (23%) in passage retrieval over the best known results.
We also evaluated other two techniques, pseudo-feedback and abbreviation correction.
We specified five different types of domain-specific knowledge (i.e., synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, lexical variants, and implicitly related concepts) and examined their effects in performance contribution.
The application of our conceptual IR model in other domains such as clinical medicine will be investigated. 
In our future work , we will explore the use of other existing knowledge resources , such as UMLS and the
