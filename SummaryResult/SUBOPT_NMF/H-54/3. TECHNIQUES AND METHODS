For each concept b∈B, compute the association between b and A using the mutual information measure [5]: P( , ) ( , ) log P( )P( ) b A I b A b A = where P(x) = n/N, n is the number of MEDLINE citations having x and N is the size of MEDLINE.
Similarly, list_C is created for C. Concepts in B = list_A ∩ list_C are considered as implicitly related concepts of the query.
Then the association between b and the query q is measured by : { : and ( ) ( ) } ( , ) { : and ( ) ( )
