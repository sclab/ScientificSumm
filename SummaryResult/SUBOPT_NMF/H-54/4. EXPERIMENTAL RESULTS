4.2.2 Contribution of different types of knowledge A series of experiments were performed to examine how each type of domain-specific knowledge contributes to the retrieval performance.
This result also indicates that biologists are likely to use different variants of the same concept according to their own writing preferences and these variants might not be collected in the existing biomedical thesauruses.
The experimental result is shown in Table 4.2.1.
It is clearly shown that the performance is significantly improved (107% on passage level, 63.1% on aspect level, and 49.6% on document level) when the domain-specific knowledge is appropriately incorporated.
We do
