For each clause C ∈ φ, we convert every negated variable ¯xi into ni and add the conjunction z1 ∧ · · · ∧ zn.
Thus, for a clause C = (x2 ∧ ¯x7 ∧ ¯y5) we construct a cheap security SC, with payoff clause (z1 ∧ · · · ∧ zn ∧ x2 ∧ n7 ∧ ¯y5).
For each existential variable xi we add additional base securities, ni and zi.
However, this would allow one to buy a security for nothing that pays (in the worst case) nothing.
In our basic construction , each expensive security costs C and each
