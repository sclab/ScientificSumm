Let αi be the fraction of order oi accepted by the auctioneer (in the indivisible case, αi must be either 0 or 1; in the divisible case, αi can range from 0 to 1).
The corresponding payoff vector is: Υ = Υ A1A2A3 , Υ A1A2 ¯A3 , Υ A1 ¯A2A3 , .
(Matching problem, indivisible case) Given a set of orders O, does there exist αi ∈ {0, 1} with at least one αi = 1 such that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0?
The auctioneer can process both orders , leaving a surplus of $ 0.1 in cash and one unit of A1 ¯A2
