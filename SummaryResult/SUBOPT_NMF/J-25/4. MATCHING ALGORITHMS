For example, in some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction techniques, without writing down the full payoff vectors.
There is some hope that specialized algorithms that  exploit structure among bids can perform better in terms of average-case time and space complexity.
The straightforward algorithm for solving the indivisible matching problem is  integer programming.
With n events, to set up the  appropriate linear or integer programs, simply writing out the payoff vectors in the straightforward way requires O(2n ) space.
The straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible matching problem is linear programming ; we set up an appropriate linear
