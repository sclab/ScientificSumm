We then analyze in  detail the auctioneer"s matching problem.
We show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Î£p 2-complete in the indivisible case.
We show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe language restrictions on bids.
We develop and motivate the concept of a compound  securities market, presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples.
The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents" and  auctioneer"s optimization problems.
With log n events , the problem is polynomial in
