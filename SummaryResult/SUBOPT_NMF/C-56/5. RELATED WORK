Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process  specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.
In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.
Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture  contains widely distributed process coordinators, which  coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.
They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and  better distribution and scheduling algorithms.
