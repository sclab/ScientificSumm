The  portion of the XML document that describes the process and activity types is shown below.
All parallel controller types fork the execution of one or more process elements, and then, wait for each execution to finish.
The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while.
In detail, a process is composed of activities,  subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1).
They extend the  respective sequential counterparts to allow parallel execution of process elements.
There are sequential and parallel controllers.
The whole computation is made by a process , which uses a parallel controller to start and dispatch several concurrent
