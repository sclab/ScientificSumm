In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that  allow the execution of structured processes in a widely  distributed and hierarchical manner.
This support  infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive  distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of  process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.
These features contribute to better  scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.
Moreover
