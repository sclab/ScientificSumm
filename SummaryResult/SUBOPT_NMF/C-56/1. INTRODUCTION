In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies.
The  programming model employs structured control flow to promote  controlled and contextualized activity execution.
Next Section describes the programming model, and  Section 3, the support infrastructure for the proposed grid  computing model.
There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid.
In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.
Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities.
The programming model and the support infrastructure
