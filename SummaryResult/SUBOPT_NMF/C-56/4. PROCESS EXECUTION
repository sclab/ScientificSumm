A FindPrimes process  instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.
In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.
Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to  execute a process element.
Such procedure is followed recursively by all process  coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a  process.
