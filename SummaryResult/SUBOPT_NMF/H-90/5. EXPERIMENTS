To see how much improvement we have achieved on improving the ranks of the unseen relevant documents, we exclude these 29 relevant  documents from our judgment file and recompute the performance of BayesInt and the baseline using the new judgment file.
However, such improvement is really not beneficial for the user as the user has already seen these relevant documents.
