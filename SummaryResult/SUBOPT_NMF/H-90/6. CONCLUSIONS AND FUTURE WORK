Finally, we should further study a general retrieval framework for sequential decision making in interactive  information retrieval and study how to optimize some of the parameters in the context-sensitive retrieval models. 
We will also do a user study to evaluate effectiveness of these models in the real web search.
We are currently developing a client-side personalized search agent, which will incorporate some of the proposed algorithms.
Second, the  proposed models can be implemented in any practical systems.
For example , we may treat a clicked summary differently depending on whether the current query is a generalization or refinement of the
