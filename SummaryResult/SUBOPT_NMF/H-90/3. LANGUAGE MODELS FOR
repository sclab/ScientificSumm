As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.
The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking  documents in response to Q1.
We use  Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial  distributions.
Thus we have the following updating equations : p ( w|φi ) = c ( w , Qi ) + µip ( w|φi−1 ) |Qi| + µi p ( w|φi ) = c ( w , Ci ) + νip ( w|φi ) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent
