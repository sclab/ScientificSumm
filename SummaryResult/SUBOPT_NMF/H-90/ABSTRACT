We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.
Experiment results show that using implicit feedback,  especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval  performance substantially.
We propose several  contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.
In this paper , we study how to exploit implicit feedback information , including previous queries
