If the maximal frequency of every equivalence classes was one then each remaining player t in procurement set sk also have external competition as all the internal competitors of players ¯t = t, ¯t ∈ sk are an external competition for t. If we have freqk([t], S) players from class [t] who were reduced then there is sufficient external competition for all players in sk.
So by reducing the number of equivalence classes |ec| procurement sets we cover all the remaining players with internal competition.
Denote by D1 = D0 ( b ) the dividing function used by GTR-2 when
