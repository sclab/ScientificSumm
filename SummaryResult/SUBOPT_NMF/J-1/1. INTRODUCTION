Despite the works discussed above, the question of how to design a general mechanism that achieves IR, IC, and BB independently of the problem domain remains open.
For example, in the important domain of combinatorial  doublesided auctions there is no known result that bounds the loss of social welfare needed to achieve budget balance.
[16, 9, 3] present mechanisms that approximate the social welfare while achieving an IR, IC and BB mechanism.
There are problem instances in which no welfare loss is necessary but by [15] there are problem instances in which there is welfare loss.
Recently we also learned
