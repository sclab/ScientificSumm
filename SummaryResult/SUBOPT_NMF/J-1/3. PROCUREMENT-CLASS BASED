An allocation rule R is Bid Monotonic if for any player i, any bids of the other players b−i ∈ V−i, and any two possible bids of i, ˆbi > bi, if i trades under the allocation rule R when reporting bi, then i also trades when reporting ˆbi.
It is possible to define an X that does not intersect every possible procurement set.
We start by proving IR and IC: 6 Although the definition of an X-external mechanism  requires that X intersects every procurement set, this is not strictly necessary.
Theorem 3.1 characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions for a mechanism
