In this paper we provide a procedure called a  Generalized Trade Reduction (GTR) for single-value players, which given an IR and IC mechanism, outputs a mechanism which is IR, IC and BB with a loss of welfare.
We bound the welfare achieved by our procedure for a wide range of  domains.
In particular, our results improve on existing  solutions for problems such as double sided markets with  homogenous goods, distributed markets and several kinds of supply chains.
Furthermore , our solution provides budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed markets with strategic transportation
