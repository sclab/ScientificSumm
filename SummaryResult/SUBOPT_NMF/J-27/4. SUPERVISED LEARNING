There may be several learning algorithms for C with different sample complexities.
, pn ∈ Γ is γ-shattered by a class of real functions C if there exists x1, .
Definition 1.
, bn) ∈ {0, 1}n there exists a function fb ∈ C such that fb(pi) ∈ xi + H+ 0 if bi = 0 and f(pi) ∈ xi + H− 1 if bi = 1.
For given observations S = {(p1, x1), .
An upper bound on the sample complexity can also be proved for our definition of fat shattering , but we do not bring it here as the proof is much more
