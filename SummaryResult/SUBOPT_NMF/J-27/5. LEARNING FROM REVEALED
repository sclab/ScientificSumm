Therefore the shattering of the prices p1, .
||yj ||1 · ||pis − pi||∞ = o(1) for s = 1, .
d and j = 1, .
To show that such a function exists it suffices to show that Afriat"s conditions are satisfied.
Applying H¨olders inequality we get |pir · yjs − pi · yj | ≤ |(pir − pi) · yj| + |pir · (yjs − yj)| ||pir − pi||∞ · ||yj ||1 + ||yjs − yj||∞ · ||pir||1.
We show that the class of utility functions that have marginal utilities with compact support and for which the relevant demand functions are income-Lipschitzian has finite
