A sequence of prices and demands are rationalizable if there exists a concave, continuous and monotone utility function such that the demands are the maximizers of the utility function over the budget set corresponding to the price.
Afriat [1] presented necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite sequence to be rationalizable.
Varian [20] and later Blundell et al.
[3, 4] continued this line of work studying nonparametric methods to forecasts demand.
Their results essentially characterize learnability of degenerate classes of demand functions and therefore fall short of giving a  general degree of confidence in the forecast.
