, d} for p, p ∈ ∆d.
The second assumption we make on the utility is that all the marginals (partial derivatives) are monotone decreasing.
This property reflects an assumption that preferences and demands have some sort of stability.
Note that with this metric ∆d is compact.
This is the law of diminishing marginal utility which assumes that the larger the excess of one good over the other the less we value each additional good of one kind over the other.
We may therefore assume from here on that demand functions are single valued. 
we assume u has marginal utility zero
