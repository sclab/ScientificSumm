First, the  algorithm finds s ∈ Rn + such that the weighted digraph D(A, s) defined by the matrix ˜aij = siaij has no cycle with  negative total weight if D(A) satisfies AC and returns a negative cycle otherwise.
Now we describe how to choose the si"s. Define S = {(i, j) : aij < 0}, E = {(i, j) : aij = 0} and T = {(i, j) : aij > 0} and let G = ([n], S ∪ E) be a digraph with weights wij = −1 if (i, j) ∈ S and wij = 0 otherwise.
Teo and Vohra [ 17 ] give a strongly polynomial time
