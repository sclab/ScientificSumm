Varian [20] introduces the generalized axiom of revealed preference (GARP), an equivalent form of Afriat"s consistency condition that is easier to verify  computationally.
These papers introduce a model where an agent observes prices and Engel curves for these prices.
This gives an  improvement on Varian"s original bounds, though the basic idea is still to rule out demands that are revealed inferior.
Afriat [1] gives another set of rationalizability conditions the observations must satisfy.
Applying non parametric statistical methods , they reconstruct a trajectory from the observed demands of different segments and use it to obtain tighter
