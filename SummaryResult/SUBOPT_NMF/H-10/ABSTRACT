Unlike traditional globally  regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer.
Finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.
We will show that the cluster memberships of the  documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix, which can be efficiently solved by iterative methods.
