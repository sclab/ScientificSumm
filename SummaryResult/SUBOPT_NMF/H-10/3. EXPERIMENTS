Our CLGR method outperforms all other document clustering methods in most of the datasets; 2.
When constructing the global regularizer, we have adopted the local scaling method [30] to construct the Laplacian matrix.
For document clustering, the Spherical k-means method usually outperforms the traditional k-means clustering method, and the GMM method can achieve  competitive results compared to the Spherical k-means method; 3.
Tri-Factorization Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (TNMF) [12].
Clustering accuracy can be computed as : Acc = 1 N max   Ck , Lm T ( Ck , Lm )   , ( 29 ) where Ck denotes
