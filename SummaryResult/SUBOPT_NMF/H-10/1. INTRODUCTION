As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian  Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is  usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g.
For  example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to  optimize some cut value (e.g.
For example, hierarchical  agglomerative clustering (HAC) [13] is a typical bottom-up  hierarchical clustering method.
However , unlike spectral clustering , which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [ 2 ]
