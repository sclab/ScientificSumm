Generally, the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold.
(13) corresponds to  minimizing Jg = qT Lq = n i=1 (qi − qj)2 wij, (15) where q = [q1, q2, · · · , qn]T with qi = q(xi), L is the graph Laplacian with its (i, j)-th entry Lij =    di − wii, if i = j −wij, if xi and xj are adjacent 0, otherwise, (16) where di = j wij is the degree of xi, wij is the similarity between xi and xj.
