The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis.
In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page.
Achlioptas et al[2] decompose the web into hub and authority attributes then combine them with content.
In the algorithm, all links are treated as undirected edge of the link graph.
In our approach , the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page ,
