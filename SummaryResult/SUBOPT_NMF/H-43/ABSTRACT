In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.
Further  analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.
Though a few methods exploit both the link  structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.
Being practically attractive for its great simplicity , this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits
