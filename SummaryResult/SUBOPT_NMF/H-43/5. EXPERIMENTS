5.3 Results The average classification accuracies for the WebKB data set are shown in Table 3.
We use 50 latent factors for Z.
The combination of link and content using SVM achieves similar accuracy as that of SVM on content alone, which confirms individual links in a web page give little information.
â€¢ Link-content MF This is our approach of matrix  factorization described in Section 3.
The result shown in Figure 4(a) and 4(b).
