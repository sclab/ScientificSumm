When we come to the clustering application, we can use this model to find Z, then apply K-means to partition the web pages into clusters.
Actually, we can use the idea of nonnegative matrix factorization for clustering [20] to directly cluster web pages.
The values of the entries are the weights of linear model, instead of the probabilities of web pages belonging to latent  topics.
As the example with nonnegative constraints shown in Section 3, we represent each cluster by a latent topic, i.e.
Therefore, we allow the components take any possible real  values.
