We also discuss an extension for clustering application.
Our experiments show our approach is effective for classification.
The directed links are generated from the linear combination of linkage of between source and destination factors.
By sharing  factors between text content and link structure, it is easy to combine both the content information and link structure.
Acknowledgment We would like to thank Dr. Dengyong Zhou for sharing his code of his algorithm.
Also, thanks to the reviewers for constructive comments. 
We propose a simple approach using factors to model the text content and link structure of web pages/documents.
