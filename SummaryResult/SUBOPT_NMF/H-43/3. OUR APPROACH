(1) and obtaining Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1.
The solution Z is identical subject to a scaling factor.
Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20].
(2) and Eq.
Once we have the vector zi, we can use many  traditional classification methods (such as SVMs) or clustering tools (such as K-Means) to perform the analysis.
Then , we factorize A by ZUZ
