Additional resource load  information about servers is not disseminated.
Such self-managing capabilities of software agents allow a reliable resource allocation even in an environment with unreliable resource providers.
They optimise the resource  allocation process continuously over their lifetime to changes in the availability of shared resources by learning from past allocation decisions.
Another mainly unsolved problem of those approaches is the fine-tuning of price and time, budget constraints to enable efficient resource allocation in large, dynamic systems [22].
In this sense , each agent is a resource consumer that acquires a certain amount of resources for the execution of its
