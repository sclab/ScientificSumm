The first experiment shows our model in a stable 3-server environment that provide a total amount of 7000 resource units.
Figure 4 shows the results from 100 repetitions of this experiment.
5.2 Experimental Results This section shows results from selected experiments that demonstrate the performance of our proposed resource  allocation mechanism.
This causes an overload situation at server 1 because of its low capacity of shared resources, and a large amount of free resources on server 2.
- Execution time: The execution time of a task for the execution, independent from the execution platform.
The resources of those servers not considered
