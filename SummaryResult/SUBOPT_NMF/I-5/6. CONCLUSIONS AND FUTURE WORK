This approach can be easily extended or supported by resource balancing/queuing mechanisms provided by  resources.
A simple decision mechanism based on different beliefs of the agent creates an emergent behaviour that leads to effective resource  allocation.
A large number of shared resources requires older historical information to avoid a too frequently resources exploration.
Especially in dynamic and scalable environments such as grid systems, a robust and distributed mechanism for resource allocation is required.
This process of acquiring resource load information about all servers can take a long time in the case that no not enough shared resources for all tasks
