In particular, we focus on a setting where traders bet on the outcome of a competition among n candidates.
securities, one for each  possible final ordering, is both cumbersome for the traders and computationally infeasible even for modest sized n.  Moreover, traders" attention would be spread among n!
We want to offer traders the most expressive bidding language possible while maintaining computational feasibility.
Pair betting , described in Section 3.3 , allows traders to bet on the final ranking of any two candidates , for example candidate D will defeat candidate R. In Section 5 , we show that
