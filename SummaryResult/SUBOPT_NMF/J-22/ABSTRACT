For subset betting, we show that the  auctioneer problem can be solved in polynomial time if orders are divisible.
and the number of subsets of  orderings is 2n!
Subset betting allows traders to bet either that a candidate will end up ranked among some subset of positions in the final ordering, for example, horse A will finish in positions 4, 9, or 13-21, or that a position will be taken by some  subset of candidates, for example horse A, B, or D will finish in position 2.
