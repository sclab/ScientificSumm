The complexity changes dramatically for pair betting.
In a subset betting market, traders can bet either on a subset of positions that a candidate stands or on a subset of  candidates who occupy a specific position in the final ordering.
We find that in a subset betting  market an auctioneer can find the optimal set and quantity of orders to accept such that his worst-case profit is maximized in polynomial time if orders are divisible.
different final orderings, we propose two expressive betting languages, subset betting and pair betting.
We examine the auctioneer problem of matching orders without incurring risk
