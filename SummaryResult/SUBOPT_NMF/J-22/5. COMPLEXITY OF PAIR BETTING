Consider the graph of accepted orders for optimal divisible matching, G∗ (V ∗ , E∗ ), which consists of the optimal subset of edges E∗ to be accepted by the auctioneer, with edge weight xe > 0 getting from the optimal solution of the linear program (7).
When xe"s are less than 1, l(G∗ ) can be less than or equal to k(G∗ ).
The minimum total quantity of losing orders is the solution to weighted minimal feedback arc set problem on H, that is l(H).
Despite the potential profit increase for accepting divisible orders , the auctioneer '' s
