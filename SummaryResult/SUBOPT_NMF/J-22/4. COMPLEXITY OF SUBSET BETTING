For every order of the form α|Φ there are edges from candidate node α to every position node in Φ.
Thus, the matching problem can be solved in polynomial time also. 
This linear program has |O| + 1 variables, one variable xi for each order i and the profit  variable c. It also has exponentially many constraints.
The separation problem for a linear program takes as input a vector of variable values and returns if the vector is feasible, or otherwise it returns a violated constraint.
For orders of the form Ψ|j there are edges from each candidate in Ψ to
