The following example illustrates the matching problem for indivisible orders in the subset-betting market.
Definition 2 (Existence of match, divisible orders).
Given a set of orders O, does there exist a set of xi ∈ {0, 1}, i ∈ O, with at least one xi = 1 such that i (bi − Ii(s))qixi ≥ 0, ∀s ∈ S?
In the next section, we will show that somewhat surprisingly there is an elegant  polynomial solution to both the matching and optimal matching problems, based on classic combinatorial problems.
Given a set of orders O , choose xi ∈ { 0
