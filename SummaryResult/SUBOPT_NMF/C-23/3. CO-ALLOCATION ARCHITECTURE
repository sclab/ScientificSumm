Brute-Force Co-Allocation: Brute-Force Co-Allocation works by dividing the file size equally among available flows.
The Conservative Load Balancing dynamic co-allocation strategy divides requested datasets into k disjoint blocks of equal size.
Among its many features are security, parallel streams, partial file transfers, third-party transfers, and reusable data channels.
It provides a uniform and flexible interface for data collected by lower-level information providers in two modes: static (e.g., OS, CPU types, and system architectures) and dynamic data (e.g., disk availability, memory availability, and loading).
GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol optimized for high-bandwidth  widearea networks.
