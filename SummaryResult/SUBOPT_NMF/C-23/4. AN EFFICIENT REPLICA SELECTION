We assume node i is the local site the user or application logs in on, and node j possesses the replica the user or application wants.
I/O state: Data Grid nodes consist of different heterogeneous storage systems.
The seven system parameters our replica selection cost model considers are : Scorei-j : the score value represents how efficiently a user or application at node i can acquire a replica from node j BW jiP : percentage of bandwidth available from node i to node j ; current bandwidth divided by highest theoretical bandwidth BBW : network bandwidth weight defined by the
