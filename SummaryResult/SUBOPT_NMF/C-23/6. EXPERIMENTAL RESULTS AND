Thus, we may infer that the main gains our technology offers are lower transmission and combination times than other co-allocation strategies.
We observed that for our testbed and our co-allocation technology, overall performance reached its highest value in the REC3_2 case.
They also show that in most cases, overall performance increased as the number of co-allocated flows increased.
These results demonstrate that our approach efficiently reduces the differences in servers finish times.
