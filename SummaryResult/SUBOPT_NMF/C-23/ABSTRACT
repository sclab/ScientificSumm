In this paper, we propose a dynamic  coallocation scheme, namely Recursive-Adjustment Co-Allocation scheme, to improve the performance of data transfer in Data Grids.
Our approach reduces the idle time spent waiting for the slowest server and decreases data transfer completion time.
We also provide an effective scheme for reducing the cost of reassembling data blocks.

However , a major obstacle , the idle time of faster servers having to wait for the slowest server to deliver the final block , makes it important
