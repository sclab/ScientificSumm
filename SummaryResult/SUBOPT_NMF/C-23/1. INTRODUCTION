Co-allocation of data transfers enables the clients to download data from multiple locations by establishing multiple connections in parallel.
Bandwidth quality is the most important factor affecting transfers between clients and servers since download speeds are limited by the bandwidth traffic congestion in the links connecting the servers to the clients.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic co-allocation scheme based on co-allocation Grid data transfer architecture called  RecursiveAdjustment Co-Allocation scheme that reduces the idle time spent waiting for the slowest server and improves data transfer performance [24].
Most Data Grid applications execute simultaneously and access large numbers of data
