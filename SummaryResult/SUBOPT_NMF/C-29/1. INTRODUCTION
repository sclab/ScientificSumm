The prototype CONFLEX-G allocates calculation trial structures  optimization, which is a very time-consuming task, to worker nodes in the grid environment in order to obtain high throughput.
In order to support parallel programming, an RPC client can issue asynchronous call requests to a different remote computer to exploit  networkwide parallelism via OmniRPC.
An overview Selection of Initial Structure Conformations Database Local Perturbation Geometry Optimization Comparison and Registration Figure 1: Algorithm of conformational space search in the original CONFLEX.
This requires the vast computer resources of a grid computing environment.
This paper demonstrates that CONFLEX-G is able to exploit the huge
