The speedups in these tables were computed respectively based on the  performance of one worker and 16 workers of the Toyo cluster using CONFLEX MPI.
Table 6 and Table 7 show the performance of CONFLEX-G in the grid environment and that of  CONFLEX MPI in the Toyo cluster, respectively.
When using a set of over 500 computing nodes for 1BL1, the  number of one trial structures assigned to each worker will be only one or two.
One idea for increasing parallelism is to overlap the  execution of two or more sets of trial structures.
Figure 9 reveals the effect of
