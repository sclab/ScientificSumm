The experimental result shows that CONFLEX-G achieved a speedup of 56.5 times for the 1BL1 molecule, where the molecule consists of a large number of atoms and each trial structure optimization requires a great deal of time.
Future studies will include development of deployment tools and an examination of fault tolerance.
The load imbalance of the trial structure optimizations may cause performance degradation.
In the  current OmniRPC, the registration of an execution program to remote hosts and deployments of worker programs are  manually set.
We need to refine the algorithm used to generate the trial structure in order to improve
