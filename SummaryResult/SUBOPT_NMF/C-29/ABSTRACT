The  experimental result shows that CONFLEX-G achieved a speedup of 56.5 times in the case of the 1BL1 molecule, where the molecule consists of a large number of atoms, and each trial structure optimization requires significant time.
CONFLEX-G is the grid-enabled version of a molecular  conformational space search program called CONFLEX.
The load imbalance of the optimization time of the trial structure may also cause performance degradation.
We have implemented CONFLEX-G using a grid RPC system called OmniRPC.
This can eliminate unnecessary communication and initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G. CONFLEXG can achieve performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and can
