2.2 Parallelization of CONFLEX for Cluster For application to over 100 atoms, CONFLEX was  improved using high-performance parallel computing techniques.
The first strategy involves both corner  flapping and edge flipping for the ring atoms and stepwise  rotation for side-chains or backbone chains.
Figure 2 shows the strategies for generating local perturbations in CONFLEX.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which  determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is pre-defined.
Generation of trial structures by local perturbations to the selected initial structure.
Then , each worker node is dynamically
