Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable  assumptions about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well with network size (both insertion and query costs scale as O( âˆš N)).
In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed  index that scalably supports multi-dimensional range queries.
In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are  sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, even for moderately sized network.
Our distributed index for multi-dimensional data ( or DIM ) uses a novel geographic embedding of a classical index data structure , and
