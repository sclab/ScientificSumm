However, for the applications we envision, where nodes within the network are trying to correlate events, the uniform distribution is highly unrealistic.
For the uniform distribution P(x) ∝ c for some constant c. If each query size from 1 .
Recall now that all queries have to pay an  approximate cost of O( √ N) to deliver the query near the covering zone.
Now, suppose that query sizes follow some density function f(x), then the average cost of resolve a query can be approximated by Ê N 1 xf(x)dx.
Finally , for the exponential distribution , f
