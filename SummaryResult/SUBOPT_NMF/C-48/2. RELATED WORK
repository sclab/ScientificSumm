Our work is similar in spirit to this body of  literature.
This index is used to direct queries to nodes that have detected relevant data.
Unlike these approaches, in our work the data generated at a node are hashed (in general) to different  locations.
Our work is superficially similar to CAN in that both construct a zone-based overlay atop of the underlying physical  network.
A similar differentiation applies with respect to work on data-centric routing in sensor networks [ 15 , 25 ] , where data generated at a node is assumed to be stored at the node , and
