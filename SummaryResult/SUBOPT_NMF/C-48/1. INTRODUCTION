Building upon this, DIMs use a technique whereby events whose attribute values are close are likely to be stored at the same or nearby nodes.
We discuss the design of a DIM, presenting algorithms for event insertion and querying, for maintaining a DIM in the event of node failure, and for making DIMs robust to data or packet loss (Section 3).
For example , if in a habitat monitoring application , a bird alighting on its nest is indicated by a certain range of thermopile sensor readings , and a certain range of microphone readings , a multi-dimensional range query
