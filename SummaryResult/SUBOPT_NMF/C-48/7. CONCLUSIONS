Unlike traditional database indices that re-balance trees upon data insertion, in sensor networks it might be feasible to re-structure the zones on a much larger timescale after obtaining a rough global estimate of the data  distribution.
One is adaptation to skewed data  distributions, since these can cause storage and transmission hotspots.

A third is support for efficient resolution of existential queries-whether there exists an event matching a multi-dimensional range
