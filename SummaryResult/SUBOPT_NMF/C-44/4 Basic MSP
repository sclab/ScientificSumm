Basic MSP only makes use of the order information  between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence.
When M and d are appropriately large, the polygon for each target node may become sufficiently small so that accurate  estimation can be achieved.
1: repeat 2: GetOneUnprocessedSeqence(); 3: repeat 4: GetOneNodeFromSequenceInOrder(); 5: GetBoundaries(); 6: UpdateMap(); 7: until All the target nodes are updated; 8: until All the node sequences are processed; 9: repeat 10: GetOneUnestimatedNode(); 11: CentroidEstimation(); 12: until All the target nodes are estimated; each sequence.
For vertical scan 1 , the node sequence is ( 8,1,5 ,
