It works using sensors typically used by sensor  network applications, such as light and acoustic sensors, both of which we specifically consider in this work.
We  demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly  improve localization accuracy.
â€¢ We propose a distribution-based location estimation  strategy that obtains the final location of sensor nodes using the marginal probability of joint distribution among  adjacent nodes within the sequence.
To address these limitations in current approaches , in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning ( MSP ) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization
