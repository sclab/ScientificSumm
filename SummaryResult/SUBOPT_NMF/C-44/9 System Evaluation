9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.
In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.
When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy  (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).
