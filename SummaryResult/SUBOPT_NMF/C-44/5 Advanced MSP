node"s area Succ.
node"s area Predecessor node exists: conditional distribution based on pred.
Four Cases in DBE Process no neighbor node in the original event-based node sequence shares an overlapping area, or if the neighbors have not been processed due to bigger gaps, a uniform distribution Uniform() is applied to this isolated node (the Alone case in Figure 8).
Through previous localization events, the whole map has been partitioned into many small location areas.
Then all the vmaps are combined to get a single map and weighted estimation is used to obtain the final location.
Therefore
