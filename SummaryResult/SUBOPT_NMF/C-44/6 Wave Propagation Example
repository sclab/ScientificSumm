Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event.
However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.
The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.
In Figure 11 , if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line , which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9 '' s area ( the gray area ) , the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node
