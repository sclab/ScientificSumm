Impact of Candidate Angle Density: Figure 18(b) shows that the smaller the candidate scan angle step, the better the  statistical performance in terms of mean error.
This phenomenon makes statistical sense, because the law of large numbers tells us that node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when the number of nodes is increased.
Therefore, Figure 16 compares the three methods to one another.
8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE MSP could bring about statistically better performance.
For example , adaptive MSP improves
