Starting from a basic MSP design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy.
This  evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on  sensor nodes nor precise event distribution.
We address several interesting issues, such as  incomplete (partial) node sequences and sequence flip, found in the Mirage test-bed we built.
It also provides a nice tradeoff between physical cost (anchors) and soft cost (events), while maintaining localization accuracy.
The novel idea behind MSP is to reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing
