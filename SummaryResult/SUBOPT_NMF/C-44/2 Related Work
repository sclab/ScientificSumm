â€¢ For anchor-based solutions such as Centroid [4], APIT [8], SeRLoc [10], Gradient [13] , and APS [15], the main idea is that the location of each node is estimated based on the known locations of the anchor nodes.
Range-free  methods can be generally classified into two types: anchor-based and anchor-free solutions.
In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be  precise in both time and space.
Instead, external event generators and data processing platforms are used.
Different anchor combinations narrow the areas in which the target nodes can possibly be located.
In addition , ranging signals generated by sensor nodes
