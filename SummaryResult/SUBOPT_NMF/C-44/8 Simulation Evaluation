This phenomenon has an interesting explanation: the cutting lines created by anchor nodes are  exploited by both basic MSP and sequence-based MSP, so as the 24 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Basic MSP VS Iterative MSP Iterative Times Error Max Error of Iterative Seq MSP Mean Error of Iterative Seq MSP Max Error of Basic MSP Mean Error of Basic MSP Figure 16.
We conclude that sequence-based MSP performs extremely well when there are many scan events.
The purpose of using regular scan is to keep the scan
