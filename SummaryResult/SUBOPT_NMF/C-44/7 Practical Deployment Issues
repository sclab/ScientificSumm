We firstly start with a scenario  applying time synchronization.
However, when multiple nodes are located very near to each other along the event propagation  direction, even when time synchronization with less than 1ms error is achieved in the network, sequence flip may still occur.
Now unfortunately, the node sequence is mistaken to be (2,1).
According to the elimination rule in  sequencebased MSP, the left part of node 1"s area is cut off as shown in the right part of Figure 13(a).
Two separate paths in the network may result in two sequences that could not be further
