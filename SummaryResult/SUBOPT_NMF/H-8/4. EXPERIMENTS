Run RTC to 95% confidence on the initial c. 4.
Using the model from Section 3, estimate the  probabilities of relevance for all documents retrieved by all k runs.
To put our method to the test, we selected c = 2: we will build a set of judgments from evaluating only two initial systems.
Since summary statistics are useful, we devised the  following metric.
1: pi ← 0.5 for all documents i 2: while P(ΔMAP < 0) < α do 3: calculate weight wi for all unjudged documents i (see Carterette et al.
We use RTC or MTC to set the odds
