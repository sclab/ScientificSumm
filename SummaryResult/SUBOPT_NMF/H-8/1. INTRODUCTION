This solution is not adequate for our hypothetical  researcher.
A malicious  adversary can always produce a new ranked list that has not retrieved any of the judged documents.
The amount of data available to researchers would grow  exponentially over time. 
The solution used by NIST at TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) is the pooling method [19, 20]: all competing systems contribute N documents to a pool, and every document in that pool is judged.
Can they evaluate without more relevance judgments?
She does not have the time or resources to judge every document, or even every retrieved document.
This method creates
