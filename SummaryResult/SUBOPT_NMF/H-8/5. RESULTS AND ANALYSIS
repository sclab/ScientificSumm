(1)) calculated using their respective probability estimates.
For the 50% of sets with more than 235 judgments, accuracy is 93% when confidence is at least 0.9.
We ran IP for the same number of judgments that MTC took for each pair, then ranked the systems by MAP  using only those judgments (all unjudged documents assumed nonrelevant).
MTC required a mean of 823 judgments, 16 per topic, while RTC required a mean of 502, 10 per topic.
We saw this in Table 2 and Figure 2 where RTC exhibits a dip in accuracy when confidence is around 97%.
Overfitting is difficult
