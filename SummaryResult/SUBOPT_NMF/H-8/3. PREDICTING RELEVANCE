Using these as prior parameters ensures that the resulting probabilities will be concentrated around the ratio of relevant documents that have been discovered for topic t. This means that the probability estimates decrease by rank and are higher for topics that have more relevant documents.
Since q∗ ij is based on the rank at which a document is retrieved rather than the identity of the document itself, the probabilities are identical from expert to expert, e.g.
Let θrj (i) be the relevance coefficient of the document at rank rj(i).
