We have many more experimental results that we  unfortunately did not have space for but that reinforce the notion that RTC is highly robust: with just a few judgments per topic, we can accurately assess the confidence in any  pairwise comparison of systems.
We see further use for this method in scenarios such as web retrieval in which the corpus is frequently changing.
In the meantime, capping  confidence estimates at 95% is a hack that solves the problem.
As time goes on , the number of judgments grows until there is 100 % confidence in every evaluation-and there is a
