We then present a method for augmenting a set of relevance judgments with relevance estimates that require no additional assessor effort.
In this work, we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments.
Using this method practically guarantees reusability: with as few as five judgments per topic taken from only two systems, we can reliably  evaluate a larger set of ten systems.
Even the smallest sets of judgments can be useful for evaluation of new systems.
