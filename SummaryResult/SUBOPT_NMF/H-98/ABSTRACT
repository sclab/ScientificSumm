Finally, we analyze the experimental performance of these models over the outputs of two text classifiers.
The analysis  demonstrates that one of these models is theoretically attractive  (introducing few new parameters while increasing flexibility),  computationally efficient, and empirically preferable.
We review a variety of standard approaches to converting scores (and poor  probability estimates) from text classifiers to high quality estimates and introduce new models motivated by the intuition that the empirical score distribution for the extremely irrelevant, hard to  discriminate, and obviously relevant items are often significantly  different.
