While they compared their methods to other  parametric methods based on symmetry, they fail to provide significance test results.
In more recent work [27], they investigate using a semi-parametric method that uses a monotonic  piecewiseconstant fit to the data and apply the method to na¨ıve Bayes and a linear SVM.
Finally, Bennett [1] obtained moderate gains by applying Platt"s method to the recalibration of na¨ıve Bayes but found there were more problematic areas than when it was applied to SVMs.
Our work provides asymmetric parametric methods which complement the non-parametric and semi-parametric methods they propose when data scarcity
