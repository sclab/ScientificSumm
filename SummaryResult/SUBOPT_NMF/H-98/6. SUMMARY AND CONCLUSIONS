Given the ease of  estimating the parameters of this distribution, it is a good first choice for producing quality probability estimates.
In striking contrast, the asymmetric Laplace distribution appears to be preferable over several large text domains and a variety of  performance measures to the primary competing parametric methods, though comparable performance is sometimes achieved with one of two varieties of logistic regression.
While these distributions attempt to strike a balance between the generalization power of parametric distributions and the flexibility that the added asymmetric parameters give , the asymmetric Gaussian appears to have too great of an emphasis away
