By analogy to the log-odds, the operative score that  appears promising is log weight perceptrons voting + weight perceptrons voting âˆ’ . 
We are currently evaluating the appropriateness of these methods for the output of a voted  perceptron [11].
Finally, extending these methods to the outputs of other  discriminative classifiers is an open area.
This approach may provide more power since it retains the  asymmetry assumption but not the assumption that the class-conditional densities are from an asymmetric Laplace.
Just as logistic regression allows the log-odds of the posterior distribution to be fit directly with a line , we could directly fit
