This paper extends previous work to present and evaluate a secure multi-domain publish/subscribe  infrastructure that supports and enforces fine-grained access control over the individual attributes of event types.
As the number of  participants in the network increases, security becomes an  increasing concern.
Key refresh allows us to ensure forward and backward security when event brokers join and leave the network.
We show that our approach has a smaller overall  communication overhead than existing approaches for achieving the same degree of control over security in publish/subscribe networks.
We demonstrate that the time and space overheads can be minimised by careful consideration
