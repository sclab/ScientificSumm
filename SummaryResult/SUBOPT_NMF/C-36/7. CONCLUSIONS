Our experiments show that i) by caching plaintext and  ciphertext content when possible, we are able to deliver  comparable performance to plaintext events, and ii) that  attribute encryption within an event incurs far less overhead than defining separate event types for the attributes that need different levels of protection.
Attribute level encryption can be implemented in order to enforce fine-grained access control policies.
In environments comprising multiple domains, where  eventbrokers have different security credentials, we have  quantified how a trade-off can be made between performance and expressiveness.
Event content encryption can be used to enforce an access control policy while
