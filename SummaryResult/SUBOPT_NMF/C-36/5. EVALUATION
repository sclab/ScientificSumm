The difference can be explained partially by the encrypted events being larger in size, because they include both the plaintext and the encrypted content in this test.
For each n subscriber groups the publisher publishes one event to represent the use of attribute encryption and n events representing the events for each subscriber group.
Each subscriber group has its own event type in the test.
the encryption cost is not included in the measurements.
Event encryption fares better, because of fewer encryption operations.
The graphs indicate that attribute encryption performs better than event encryption even for small numbers of subscriber
