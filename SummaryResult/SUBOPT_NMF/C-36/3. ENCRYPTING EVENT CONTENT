An attribute encrypted event in transit consists of the event type identifier, a publication timestamp, and a set of  attribute tuples: <type id, timestamp, attributes >.
Brokers that are  authorised to access some of the attributes in an event, can implement content-based routing over the attributes that are accessible to them.
This would again reveal information about the event content to the unauthorised broker.
For example , in the first case an unauthorised broker can create subscriptions with appropriately chosen filters , route them towards the root of the event dissemination tree , and monitor which events were delivered to it
