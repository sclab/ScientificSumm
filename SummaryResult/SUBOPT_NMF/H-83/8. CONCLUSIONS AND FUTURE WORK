This method crawls nodes that will most significantly impact the local domain and has running time linear in the number of nodes in the local domain.
124 Research Track Paper Often times, topic-specific domains are discovered using a focused web crawler which considers a page"s content in conjunction with link anchor text to decide which pages to crawl next [4].
The global PageRank estimation framework, along with the node selection algorithms presented, all require O(n) computation per iteration and bandwidth proportional to the number of pages crawled, Tk.
To determine the benefit of using global PageRanks in
