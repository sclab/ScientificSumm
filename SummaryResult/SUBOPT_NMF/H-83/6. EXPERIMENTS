Initially, the L1 difference between the global and local PageRanks ranged from .0469  (Stanford) to .149 (MIT).
To quantify a global page j '' s effect on the global PageRank values of pages in the local domain , we define page j '' s impact to be its PageRank value , g [ j ] , normalized by the fraction of its outlinks pointing to the local domain : impact ( j ) = oL [ j ] o [ j ] Â· g [ j ] , where , oL [ j ] is the number of outlinks from
