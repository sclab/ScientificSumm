However, their experiments differ from our work in that our node selection algorithms do not use (or have access to) global PageRank values.
also experiment within a similar crawling framework in [2], but quantify their results by comparing Kendall"s rank  correlation between the PageRanks of the current set of crawled pages and those of the entire global graph.
Wang and Dewitt [22] propose a system where the set of web servers that comprise the global domain communicate with each other to compute their respective global  PageRanks.
They found that node selection strategies that crawled pages with the highest
