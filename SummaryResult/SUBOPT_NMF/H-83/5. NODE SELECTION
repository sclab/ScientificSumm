We partition the PageRank matrix PFj , corresponding to the × subgraph Fj as: PFj = ˜F ˜s ˜uT j w , (9) where ˜F = αF (DF + diag(uj))−1 + (1 − α) e + 1 eT , ˜s = αs + (1 − α) e + 1 , ˜uj = α(DF + diag(uj))−1 uj + (1 − α) e + 1 , w = 1 − α + 1 , and diag(uj) is the diagonal matrix with the (i, i)th entry equal to one if the ith element of uj equals one, and is zero otherwise.
Then , estimate fj by removing the last 119 Research Track Paper component from our
