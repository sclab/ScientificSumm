It has also been shown that the total number of iterations needed for convergence is  proportional to α and does not depend on the size of the web graph [11, 7].
By  exploiting the sparsity of the PageRank matrix, the work per iteration can be reduced to O(km), where k is the average number of links per web page.
We define the PageRank matrix PU to be : PU = αUD−1 U + ( 1 − α ) veT , ( 1 ) where DU is the ( unique ) diagonal matrix such that UD−1 U is column stochastic
