(r) = max i∈I max ai∈Ai [ui(ai, r−i) − ui(r)], (1) where r belongs to some strategy set, R, of either pure or mixed strategies.
We define a function, : R → R, interpreted as the maximum benefit any player can obtain by deviating from its strategy in the specified profile.
When r ∈ A, the above defines a pure strategy Nash equilibrium; otherwise the definition describes a mixed strategy Nash  equilibrium.
An s ∈ S is called a mixed strategy profile.
When the distribution s is not correlated , we can simply say si ( ai ) when referring
