More generally, we show that under certain  conditions, the estimator of optimal mechanism parameter setting based on empirical data is consistent.
Our empirical mechanism analysis models the relation between a key design parameter and outcomes, confirming the observed behavior and indicating that no reasonable parameter settings would have been likely to achieve the desired effect.

We illustrate our approach with a design task from a supply-chain trading competition.
Designers adopted several rule changes in order to deter particular
