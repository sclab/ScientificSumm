Then, since for any fixed > 0, N(θ) ⊂ Nn, (θ) when n is large enough, sup{φ∗ (θ)} = sup s∈N (θ) φ(s) ≤ sup s∈Nn, (θ) φ(s) = sup{ˆφ∗ (θ)} ≤ α for any such n. Thus, since we defined the welfare function of the designer to be I{sup{φ∗ (θ)} ≤ α} in our domain of interest, the empirical choice of θ satisfies the designer"s objective, thereby maximizing his welfare function.
First , let ( Z , d ) be a metric space , and X , Y ⊂ Z and define directed
