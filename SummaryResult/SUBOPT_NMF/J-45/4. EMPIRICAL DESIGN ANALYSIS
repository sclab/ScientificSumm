Our threshold here still represents a commitment of over 20% of the suppliers" capacity for extrapolation of the maximum of the outcome correspondence  estimated from D yields θ = 320.
Our predictions  underestimate this outcome to some degree, but show that any rational outcome was likely to have high day-0 procurement.
The correspondence ˆφ∗ (θ) is the interval between  BaselineMin and BaselineMax.
