When payoff functions of players are unknown, a search using simulations has been explored as an alternative.
One approach in that direction, taken in [4] and [15], is to co-evolve the mechanism parameter and agent strategies,  using some notion of social utility and agent payoffs as fitness  criteria.
An alternative to co-evolution explored in [16] was to  optimize a well-defined welfare function of the designer using genetic programming.
Conitzer and Sandholm [6] developed a search algorithm when all the relevant game  parameters are common knowledge.
Several related approaches to search for the best mechanism exist in the Computer Science literature
