The theoretical results confirm some intuitions behind the empirical mechanism design methods we have introduced, and increases our confidence that our framework can be effective in  estimating the best mechanism parameter choice in relatively general settings.
We also described in some generality the methods for estimating a sample Nash  equilibrium function when the data is extremely scarce, or a Nash  equilibrium correspondence when more data is available.
