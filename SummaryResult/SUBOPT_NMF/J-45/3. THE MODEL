307 specified in terms of agent strategies to an equivalent welfare  outcome specified in terms of a lower-dimensional summary.
Typically we care about W (N(θ), θ), the worst-case outcome of playing some solution.4 On some problems we can gain considerable advantage by  using an aggregation function to map the welfare outcome of a game 3 We generally adopt Nash equilibrium as the solution concept, and thus take N(θ) to be the set of equilibria.
For convenience of exposition, we write φ∗ (θ) to mean φ(N(θ)).
