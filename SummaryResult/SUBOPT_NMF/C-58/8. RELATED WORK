Some of these systems internally make use of the reduction forest not only for routing but also for caching [32], but for simplicity, these systems do not  generally export this powerful functionality in their external interface.
With the aggregation abstraction provided by our system, designing and building of such applications becomes easier.
Our goal is to develop and expose the internal reduction forest of DHTs as a similarly general and useful abstraction.
This interface can be used to ensure path convergence by searching in the lowest domain and moving up to the next domain when the search
