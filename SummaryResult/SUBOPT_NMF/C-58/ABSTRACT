To serve as a basic building block, a SDIMS should have four properties: scalability to many nodes and attributes, flexibility to accommodate a broad range of applications, administrative  isolation for security and availability, and robustness to node and  network failures.
We design , implement and evaluate a SDIMS that ( 1 ) leverages Distributed Hash Tables ( DHT ) to create scalable aggregation trees , ( 2 ) provides flexibility through a simple API that lets applications control propagation of reads and writes , ( 3 ) provides administrative isolation through simple extensions to current DHT algorithms , and (
