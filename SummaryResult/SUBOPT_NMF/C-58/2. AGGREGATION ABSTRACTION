For a (physical) leaf node T0 at level 0, V0,type,name is the locally stored value for the  attribute type and name or NULL if no matching tuple exists.
Each physical node in the system is a leaf and each subtree represents a logical group of nodes.
Although SDIMS allows arbitrary aggregation functions, it is  often desirable that these functions satisfy the hierarchical  computation property [21]: f(v1,...,vn)= f(f(v1,...,vs1 ), f(vs1+1,...,vs2 ), ..., f(vsk+1,...,vn)), where vi is the value of an attribute at node i.
The system associates an
