It seems appealing to develop a SDIMS abstraction that exposes this internal functionality in a general way so that scalable trees for aggregation can be a basic system building block alongside the DHTs.
At a first glance, it might appear to be obvious that simply  fusing DHTs with Astrolabe"s aggregation abstraction will result in a SDIMS.
It provides a  general interface for installing new aggregation functions and provides eventual consistency on its data.
Astrolabe is robust due to its use of an unstructured gossip protocol for disseminating information and its strategy of replicating all aggregated attribute values for
