We also show the corresponding  aggregation tree.
Also the corresponding aggregation tree is shown.
Path Convergence: Search paths for a key from different nodes in a domain should converge at a node in that domain.
As Figure 4 illustrates , whenever two nodes in a domain share the same prefix with respect to a key and no other node in the domain has a longer prefix , our algorithm introduces a virtual node at the boundary of the domain corresponding to that prefix plus the next digit of the key ; such a virtual node is simulated by the existing
