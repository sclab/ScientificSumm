The install  interface allows applications to specify the k and j parameters of the Update-Upk-Downj strategy along with the aggregation function.
The probe interface not only allows applications to obtain the aggregated value for a specified tree but also allows a probing node to continuously fetch the values for a specified time, thus  enabling an application to adapt to spatial and temporal heterogeneity.
An  aggregation strategy like Update-All works well for read-dominated attributes but suffers high bandwidth consumption when applied for write-dominated attributes.
For example , a read-dominated attribute like numCPUs rarely changes in value , while a writedominated attribute
