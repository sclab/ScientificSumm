Given these data structures, it is simple to support the three API functions described in Section 3.1.
An aggregation function table contains the aggregation  function and installation arguments (see Table 1) associated with an  attribute type or an attribute type and name.
Upon receipt of a level-i aggregate from a parent, a level k virtual node stores the value in its ancestor MIB and, if k ≥ i−down, forwards this aggregate to its children.
As Figure 1 illustrates , the system satisfies a probe for a level-i aggregate value using a four-phase protocol that may be short-circuited when updates have
