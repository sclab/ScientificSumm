By reducing the number of nodes that have to be accessed to answer a probe, applications can reduce the  probability of incorrect results occurring due to the failure of nodes that do not contribute to the aggregate.
In particular, if an application  detects or suspects an answer as stale, then it can re-issue the probe increasing the up and down parameters to force the refreshing of the cached data.
