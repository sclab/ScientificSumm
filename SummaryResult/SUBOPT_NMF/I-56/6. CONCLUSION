Importantly, this means that it might furnish a unified framework for DCSP that not only provides a clearer BDI agent-theoretic view of existing DCSP approaches, but also opens up the opportunities to enhance or develop new strategies.
Towards the latter, we have proposed and formulated a new strategy - the UMA strategy.
Empirical results and our discussion suggest that UMA is superior to ABT, AWC and DBO in some specific aspects.
It was observed from our simulations that UMA possesses the completeness property.
Future work will attempt to formally establish this property , as well as formalize other existing DSCP algorithms
