Hence, 1 − Y e∈σi f(hσ e )f(hσ a + 1) !
Suppose σ ∈ Σ0 is a nearly-even DS-stable strategy profile.
A strategy profile σ with no heavy resources will be termed even.
Otherwise, let N(σ) denote the subset of all agents for which there exists ei such that a unilateral addition of ei is profitable.
Then let σ = ` σ−{i,j}, σi ∪ {a}, (σj {a}) ∪ {b} ´ .
Coupled with Lemma 7 , the following lemma shows that if σ is a nearly-even and DS-stable strategy profile , and σ is obtained from σ by a
