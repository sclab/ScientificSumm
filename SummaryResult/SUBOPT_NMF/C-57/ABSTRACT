It is the first model to  incorporate failures into congestion settings, which results in a strict generalization of congestion games.
In addition, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such framework, where the failure probability of each resource depends on the number of agents selecting this resource.
Each agent chooses a  subset of the resources for the execution of his task, in order to maximize his own utility.
CGLFs possess two novel features.
The utility of an agent is the difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the resources
