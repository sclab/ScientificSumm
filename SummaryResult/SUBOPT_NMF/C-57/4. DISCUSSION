We study the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria and potential functions in the presented class of games.
In particular, we plan to consider CGLFs where the resources may have different costs and failure  probabilities, as well as CGLFs in which the resource failure  probabilities are mutually dependent.
We defined a class of congestion games with load-dependent failures (CGLFs), which generalizes the  wellknown class of congestion games.
In addition, it is of  interest to develop an efficient algorithm for the computation of pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as well as discuss the social (in)efficiency of the equilibria. 
Nevertheless , if
