Each resource is associated with a cost, c(·), and a  failure probability, f(·), each of which depends on the  number of agents who use this resource.
We say that the execution of agent"s i task succeeds if the task of agent i is successfully completed by at least one of the resources chosen by him.
Given a subset S ⊆ N of the agents , the set of strategy combinations of the members of S is denoted by ΣS = ×i∈SΣi , and the set of strategy combinations of the complement subset of agents is denoted
