This paper presents a formal Adversarial Environment model for bounded  rational agents operating in a zero-sum environment.
In such environments, attempts to use classical utility-based search methods can raise a variety of difficulties (e.g., implicitly modeling the opponent as an omniscient utility maximizer, rather than leveraging a more nuanced, explicit opponent model).

We define an Adversarial Environment by describing the mental states of an agent in such an environment.
We then present behavioral
