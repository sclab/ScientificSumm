In these latter environments  especially, using a utility-based adversarial search (such as the Min-Max algorithm) does not always provide an adequate solution; the payoff function might be quite complex or  difficult to quantify, and there are natural computational  limitations on bounded rational agents.
Simple zero-sum encounters exist of course in various  twoplayer games (e.g., Chess, Checkers), but they also exist in n-player games (e.g., Risk, Diplomacy), auctions for a  single good, and elsewhere.
We explore environment properties and the mental states of agents to derive behavioral axioms ; these behavioral axioms constitute a formal model that serves as a specification
