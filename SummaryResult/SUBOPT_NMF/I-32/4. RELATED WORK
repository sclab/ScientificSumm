However, the basic limitations of those search methods still apply; our model tries to overcome those  limitations by presenting a formal model for a new, mental state-based adversarial specification. 
The classical Min-Max adversarial search algorithm was the first attempt to integrate the opponent into the search space with a weak assumption of an optimally playing  opponent.
That work shows the importance of opponent modeling and the ability to exploit it to an agent"s advantage.
As far as we know , our model is the first to provide a formalized model for explicit adversarial environments and agents '' behavior
