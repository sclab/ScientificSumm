In this paper we use FACET - an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry - to test a multi-agent algorithm for traffic flow management.
An agent is associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and its action consists of setting the separation required among the airplanes going though that fix.
Agents use reinforcement learning to set this separation and their actions speed up or slow down traffic to manage congestion.
Our FACET based results show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 45 % over agents receiving
