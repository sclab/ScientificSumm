This simple agent-action pair allows the agents to slow down or speed up local traffic and allows agents to a have significant impact on the overall air traffic flow.
In this approach, the agents" actions are to set the separation that approaching aircraft are required to keep.

The Next Generation Air Transportation Systems ( NGATS ) initiative aims to address this issues
