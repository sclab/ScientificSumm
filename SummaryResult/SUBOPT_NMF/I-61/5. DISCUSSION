We are currently extending this work in three directions.
It offers the significant benefit of not requiring radical changes to the current air flow management structure and is therefore readily deployable.
The agents use reinforcement learning to learn control policies and we explore different agent reward functions and different ways of estimating those functions.
Our method is based on agents representing fixes and having each agent determine the separation between aircraft approaching its fix.
Second we are investigating deployment strategies and looking for  modifications that would have larger impact.
First , we are exploring new methods of estimating agent rewards
