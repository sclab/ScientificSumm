FACET can be used to either simulate and display air traffic (a 24 hour slice with 60,000 flights takes 15 minutes to simulate on a 3 GHz, 1 GB RAM computer) or provide rapid statistics on recorded data (4D trajectories for 10,000 flights including sectors, airports, and fix statistics in 10 seconds on the same computer) [11].
It is based on propagating the trajectories of proposed flights forward in time.
In this paper , agents use FACET directly through batch mode , where agents send scripts to FACET asking it to simulate air traffic based on metering orders imposed by
