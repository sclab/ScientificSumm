Demand queries and linear programs The winner determination problem in combinatorial  auctions may be formulated as an integer program.
The same proof proves a similar impossibility result for other types of auctions (e.g., descending auctions, non-anonymous auctions).
The dual program has a polynomial number of variables, but an exponential number of constraints.
Theorem: For some class of valuations, bundle price  auctions that use the XOR-language require an exponential cost for finding the optimal allocation.
Our main result here is a strong negative result : Theorem : There is a 2-item 2-player problem where no ascending item-price auction can find the
