Now consider the k-tuple of valuations chosen at random as follows: a partition of the m items into k sets T1...Tk each of size m k each is chosen uniformly at random among all such partitions.
Clearly in this case the value of the best allocation is 1 since no set of size m 2 or lower has non-zero value for any player.
Note that the answer to a query S to player i differs between the case of Ti and the original case of T = { 1 ... m } only if |S| â‰¤ m 2
