This algorithm guarantees at least half of the  optimal efficiency for submodular valuations.
The idea behind the proofs is that the information that the auctioneer can get for free at the beginning of each type of auction is different.23 and non-deterministic iterative auctions: our proof shows that a non-deterministic iterative auction can elicit the  kterm XOR valuations with a polynomial number of demand queries, and [7] show that this elicitation must take an  exponential number of demand queries.
Ascending vs.
fully elicited) with a descending item-price auction.
That is , preference elicitation can be done by a non-deterministic ascending auction
