In an ascending auction, the prices in the queries to the same bidder can only increase in time.
It may be useful to define multi-trajectory ascending auctions, in which the prices maybe reset to zero a number of times (see, e.g., [4]).
Ascending auctions are iterative auctions with  non-decreasing prices: Definition 1.
Yet, our positive results will not use this power and will be efficient also in the usual computational sense.
We say that the auction finds an optimal allocation if it finds the allocation that maximizes the social welfareP i vi(Si).
