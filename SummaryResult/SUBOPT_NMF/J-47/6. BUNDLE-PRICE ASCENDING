For all bundles in the other partitions, he has a value of either 0 or of 1 − δ, and these values are unknown to the auctioneer.

Thus, bidder 2 will never demand the bundle bd, and no  information will be elicited about β.
(Sketch) Assume we have n bidders and n2 items for sale, and that n is prime.
