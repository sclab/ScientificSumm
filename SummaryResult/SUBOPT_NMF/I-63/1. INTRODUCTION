In this paper, we extend the work on resource allocation under MDP-induced preferences to discrete-time scheduling problems, where agents are present in the system for finite time intervals and can only use resources within these  intervals.
We address the problem of globally optimal resource scheduling, where the objective is to find an allocation of resources to the agents across time that maximizes the sum of the expected rewards that they obtain.
Such computational issues have recently spawned several threads of work in using compact models of agents"  preferences.
In particular , agents arrive and depart at arbitrary ( predefined
