Let the variable ψ ∈ Ψm enumerate all  possible pairs of resource bundles and time horizons for agent m, so there are 2|Ω| × Tm values for ψ (the space of bundles is exponential in the number of resource types |Ω|).
An agent will get at most one resource bundle for one of the time horizons.
Let each agent m ∈ M execute its MDP within the arrival-departure time interval τ ∈ [τa m, τd m].
The problem of finding an optimal allocation that satisfies the global constraint that the amount of each resource ω allocated to all agents does
