The agents" arrival and departure times are shown as gray boxes and are {1, 6}, {3, 7}, and {2, 11}, respectively.
The first formulation restricts resource assignments to the space where the allocation of resources to each agent is static during the agent"s lifetime.
Note that agent m1 relinquishes its hold on the resources before its announced departure time of τd m1 = 6, ostensibly because other agents can utilize the resources more effectively.
We discuss some of those  assumptions and their implications in Section 6.
