We consider the combinatorial problem of scheduling the usage of multiple resources among agents that operate in stochastic environments, modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs).
In recent years,  efficient resource-allocation algorithms have been developed for agents with resource values induced by MDPs.
We illustrate and  empirically analyze the method in the context of a stochastic  jobscheduling domain.
We provide a computationally  efficient procedure for computing globally optimal resource assignments to agents over time.
