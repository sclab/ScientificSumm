The winning solution of the KDD Cup [18] proposed  using an ensemble of classifiers in conjunction with searching multiple search engines.
The KDD task specification provided a small  taxonomy (67 nodes) along with a set of labeled queries, and posed a challenge to use this training data to build a query  classifier.
A document classifier was built for the target taxonomy by using the pages in the ODP  taxonomy that appear in the nodes mapped to the particular target node.
Compared to this approach , we solved the problem of document classification directly in the target taxonomy by using the
