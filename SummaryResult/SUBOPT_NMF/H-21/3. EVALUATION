Interestingly, we found that search engine A performs consistently better with full-page text, while search engine B performs better when summaries are used.
Figure 3 presents the results of these two approaches When full-text pages are used, the technique using individual classifications of search results evidently outperforms the bundling approach by a wide margin.
We also experimented with using different numbers of search results per query, as well as with varying the number of classifications considered for each search result.
