In this paper, we consider the following approximation of relevance function: R(a, q) ≈ RC (a, q) = Cj ∈C w(Cj)s(Cj, a)s(Cj, q).
(1) The right hand-side expresses how we use the  classification scheme C to rank ads, where s(c, a) is a scoring function that specifies how likely a is in class c, and s(c, q) is a  scoring function that specifies how likely q is in class c. The value w(c) is a weighting term for category c, indicating the importance of category c in the relevance formula.
Let a
