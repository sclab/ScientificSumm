Differences in user interaction between the last domain on the trail (Domain n) and all domains visited earlier (Domains 1 to (n - 1)) are particularly important, because they highlight the wealth of user behavior data not captured by logs of search engine interactions.
Session trails transcend multiple queries and terminate only when one of the three termination criteria above are satisfied.
Trails must contain pages that are either: search result pages, search engine homepages, or pages connected to a search result page via a sequence of clicked hyperlinks.
