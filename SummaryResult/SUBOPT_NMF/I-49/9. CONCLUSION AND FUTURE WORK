We have already developed a first MAS, in particular  integrating MYRIAD, to test this protocol in order to know more about its efficiency in terms of solution quality and quickness in finding a consensus.

We have also shown that the protocol has subgame perfect equilibria and these equilibria converge to the usual maximum solution.
