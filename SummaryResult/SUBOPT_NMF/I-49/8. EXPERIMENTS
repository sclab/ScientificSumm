All the  hospitals have similar decision criteria reflecting their preferences on the level of congestion they can face for the overall  hospital and the different services available, as briefly explained for hospital H1 hereafter.
The mediator agent makes a proposal chosen randomly in admissible set obtained with these availabilities as  linear constraints.
Moreover, only the recommendations on how to improve a proposal are taken into account.
This proposal is the vector P0 = [ [ H1 , burn , 3 ] , [ H1 , surgery , 8 ] , [ H1 , orthopaedic , 0 ] , [ H2
