Then the overall assessment of x is given by Uk(x) = Hk(uk 1 (x1), .
An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, .
A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].
In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts  substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].
We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria
