The graph of Figure 5 shows the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the  number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%.
When deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed.
As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases.
The highest density is obtained for  values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero for higher values of exposure.
The threshold for detection is chosen as
