Similar results can be derived for other parameters, most of the effort residing in finding the exposure distributions through simulation. 
The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step.
The first cost assignment is (Cd = 0, Cs = 1) so that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to be used to achieve an exposure of 95%.
These results are specific to the region and the parameters characterizing the signal emitted
