The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment.
Through simulation, the  distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random  deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed.
The  solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by  considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step and this multiple variables problem requires further  investigation. 
The strategy consists of deploying a  limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum exposure is achieved.
These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment
