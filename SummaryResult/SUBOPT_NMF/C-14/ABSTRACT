It illustrates that the cost of deployment can be minimized to achieve the desired detection performance by appropriately choosing the number of sensors deployed in each step.
This paper addresses this problem by proposing path exposure as a measure of the goodness of a deployment and presents an approach for sequential deployment in steps.

Such a sensor network achieves a certain level of detection performance with an associated cost of deployment.
