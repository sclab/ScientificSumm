The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.
To reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.
Indeed some sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability, in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same vicinity.
However , a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost
