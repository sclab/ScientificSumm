One possible measure of the goodness of deployment for target detection is called path exposure.
It is a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing the region using a given path.
The tradeoffs lie between the network performance, the cost of the sensors deployed, and the cost of deploying the sensors.
It can be predetermined when the environment is sufficiently known and under control, in which case the sensors can be strategically hand placed.
In order to detect a target moving through the region , sensors have to make local observations of the environment and collaborate to produce
