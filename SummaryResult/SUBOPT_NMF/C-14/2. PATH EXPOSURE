The detection attempts are based on energy measured over a period of time T during which the target is moving.
Therefore , the detection probability associated with each point u reflects the measurements performed during time T. Considering the path , the net probability of not detecting a target traversing the field using P is the product of the probabilities of no detection at each point u âˆˆ P. That is , if G ( P ) denotes the net probability of not detecting a target as it traverses over path P , then , log G ( P )
