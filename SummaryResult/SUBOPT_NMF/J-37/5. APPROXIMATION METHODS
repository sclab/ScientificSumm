The primal simplex maintains primal feasibility and proceeds by finding better and better primal solutions until the dual solution vector is feasible, 167 at which point optimality has been reached.
There are two versions of the simplex method: the primal simplex and the dual simplex.
At any point in time, they can output the best strategies found so far.
One can solve  increasingly less abstracted versions of the game, and evaluate the quality of the solution at every iteration using the ex post method discussed above.
Instead of requiring the payoffs at terminal nodes to match exactly , we can
