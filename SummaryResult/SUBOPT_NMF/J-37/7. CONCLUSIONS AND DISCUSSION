To further improve scalability, we introduced an  approximation variant of GameShrink, which can be used as an anytime algorithm by varying a parameter that controls the coarseness of abstraction.
168 the size of the game tree.
We also discussed how (in a two-player zero-sum game), linear programming can be used in an anytime manner to generate approximately  optimal strategies of increasing quality.
There are also other bridge programs that use search techniques for perfect information games in  conjunction with statistical sampling and expert-defined  abstraction [48].
The method also yields bounds on the suboptimality of the resulting strategies.
Such ( non-game-theoretic
