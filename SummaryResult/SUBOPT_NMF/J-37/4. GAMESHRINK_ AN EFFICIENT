Output F. Given as input an ordered game Γ, GameShrink applies the shrinking ideas presented above as aggressively as  possible.
As discussed in the next subsection, we use a union-find data structure to represent the information filter F. Each  iteration of the inner for-loop possibly performs a union  operation on the data structure; performing M operations on a union-find data structure containing N elements takes O(α(M, N)) amortized time per operation, where α(M, N) is the inverse Ackermann"s function [1, 49] (which grows  extremely slowly).
For
