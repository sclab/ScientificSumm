Using GameShrink, we find an equilibrium to a poker game with 3.1 billion nodes-over four orders of magnitude more than in the largest poker game solved previously.
Its complexity is ËœO(n2 ), where n is the number of nodes in a structure we call the signal tree.
To address even larger games, we introduce approximation methods that do not preserve equilibrium, but nevertheless yield (ex post) provably close-to-optimal strategies.
We present an  algorithm, GameShrink, for abstracting the game using our isomorphism exhaustively.
