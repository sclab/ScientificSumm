In determining the payoffs in a game with filtered signals, we take the average over all real signals in the filtered class, weighted by the probability of each real signal occurring.
Let Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u be an ordered game.
We refer to such games as filtered ordered games.
An information filter for Γ is a collection F = F1 , .
A behavior strategy for player i in round j of Γ = I , G , L , Θ , κ , γ , p , , ω , u with information filter F is
