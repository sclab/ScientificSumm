In contrast to our work, most (but not all) research involving abstraction has been for  singleagent problems (e.g.
Furthermore, the use of abstraction typically leads to sub-optimal solutions, unlike the techniques presented in this paper, which yield  optimal solutions.
In contrast to other game tree search algorithms which store a particular game position at each node of the search tree, partition search stores groups of positions that are similar.
The main result is that a game can be derived from another by a sequence of those transformations if and only if the games have the same pure reduced normal form
