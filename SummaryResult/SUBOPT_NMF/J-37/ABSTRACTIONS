(We will abuse notation and write F j −i  ˆβ  = ˆβ .)
If we take σj i,v  ˜z, Fj  ˜αj , ˜βj i  = σ j i,v  ˜z, F j  ˜αj , ˜βj i  , σ is a Nash equilibrium of ΓF .
, ˜βj n), let ˆβ denote (F j (˜αj , ˜βj 1), .
In other words, there exists (˜αj , ˜βj 1, .
For an extensive form game , a belief system μ assigns a probability to every decision node x such thatP x∈h μ ( x ) = 1 for every information set h. A strategy profile σ is sequentially rational at h given belief
