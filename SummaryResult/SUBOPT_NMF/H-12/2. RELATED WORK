Despite the importance of efficient summary generation in Web search, few algorithms appear in the literature.
Early Web search engines presented query-independent snippets consisting of the first k bytes of the result  document.
Most of the experimental work using query-biased  summarization has focused on comparing their value to searchers relative to other types of summary [20, 21], rather than  efficient generation of summaries.
[16] for overviews of the very many different applications of summarization and for the equally diverse methods for producing summaries.
Generating these is clearly much simpler and much less computationally expensive than processing documents to extract query
