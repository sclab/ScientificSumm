We also assume a balanced load for each machine, so each  machine serves about N/M documents, which is easily achieved in practice.
Each document requires 2 Kb when compressed with CTS (Table 1), and only half of each document is required using ST sentence reordering, requiring a total of N/M ×0.01× 1024 bytes.

Rather, we have reported accuracy results in terms of the four components that have been previously shown to be important in determining useful snippets [20].
We will assume that the Snippet Engine is distributed
