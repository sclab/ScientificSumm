Note that when no compression is used (Model Size is 0Mb), the collection is only 31 Gb as HTML markup, JavaScript, and repeated punctuation has been discarded as described in Section 4.1.
In addition to the document cache, the RAM of the  Snippet Engine must also hold the CTS decoding table that maps integers to strings, which is capped by a parameter at compression time (1 Gb in our experiments here).
With 1% of documents cached, about 222 Mb for the wt100g collection, around 80% of disk seeks are avoided.
All queries passed into the simulations are from the second
