In our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.
Such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one  interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).
This leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent , upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents , delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other potential
