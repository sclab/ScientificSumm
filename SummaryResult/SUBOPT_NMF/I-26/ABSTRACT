We analyze the dynamics which drive the agents" strategies towards a stable equilibrium in the new model and show that the proposed search strategy weakly dominates the one currently in use for the two-sided parallel economic search model.
The distinguishing feature of the proposed model is that the agents are not restricted to  maintaining a synchronized (instantaneous) decision protocol and can sequentially accept and reject partnerships within the same search stage.
In each search stage , each of the agents is randomly matched with several other agents in parallel , and makes a decision whether to accept a potential
