(1) The case where x < xk above is trivial: none of the other agents will accept agent Ai if the utility in such a partnership is smaller than their reservation value xk.
The unique solution to the recursive Equation 1 is: Gk(x) = 8 >>>>>< >>>>>:  1+(k−2) R ∞ y=xf(y)dy 1−k k−2 , k>2, x≥xk, exp(− R ∞ y=x f(y)dy), k=2, x≥xk, 1, k=1, x≥xk 0, x < xk.
On the other hand , when the utility associated with a potential partnership opportunity is zero ( x = 0 ) the acceptance probability is non-negligible : lim
