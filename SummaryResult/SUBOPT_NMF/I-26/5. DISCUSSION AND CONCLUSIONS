Since our analysis is equilibrium-based, a deviation from the proposed strategies is not beneficial.
Our analysis covers all aspects of the new two-sided search  technique, from individual strategy construction throughout the  dynamics that lead to stability (equilibrium).
The difficulty in the  extraction of the agents" equilibrium strategies in the new model derives from the need to recursively model, while setting an agent"s  strategy, the rejection other agents might face from other agents they interact with.
The current paper is not focused on re-arguing applicability, but rather on the improvement of the the core two-sided search model.
