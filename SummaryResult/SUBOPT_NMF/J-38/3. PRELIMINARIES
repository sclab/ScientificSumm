The Shapley value of agent i, φi(v), in game N, v is given by the following formula φi(v) = S⊆N\{i} |S|!
Formally, Definition 3.
It is often used to model voting situations.
(Shapley Value) Given a description of the coalitional game and an agent i, compute the Shapley value of agent i.
(Core Membership) Given a description of the coalitional game and a payoff vector x such that È i∈N xi = v(N), determine if È i∈S xi ≥ v(S) for all S ⊆ N. Problem 3.
An important class of coalitional games is the class of
