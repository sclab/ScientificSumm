As pointed out at the end of Section 4.3, MACG is very  naturally suited for updates.
An important direction to explore in the future is the question of efficiency in updating a game, and how to  evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch.
Some of these corollary results have been discussed in Sections 5 and 6.
Positive results  obtained under this representation can easily be translated to results about other representations.
Representation results regarding efficiency of updates, and algorithmic results regarding how to compute the different solution concepts from updates, will both be very interesting.
Our work on approximating
