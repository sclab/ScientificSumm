For each agent i ∈ N, let yi = È j ujθj i .
We claim that this vector y is in the core of N, v .
Complementary to the example above, when all the  aggregators have empty cores, the core of N, v is also empty.
Therefore, the precondition of Theorem 4 is satisfied, and the edge-spanning game with non-negative edge weights has a non-empty core.
The core of a flow game with committee control, where each edge is controlled by a simple game with a veto set of players, is non-empty.
Theorem 4.
Given a game N , v represented
