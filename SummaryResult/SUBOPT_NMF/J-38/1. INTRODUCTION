As attributes apply to both individual agents and groups of agents, we propose the use of coalitional game theory to understand what groups may form and what payoffs the agents may expect in such models.
They optimize their production profile according to the market prices for their products.
Many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by picking the right attributes.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows: â€¢ We define a formal representation for coalitional games based on attributes, and relate this representation to others proposed in the literature.
The relevant attributes of the players are their skills at playing
