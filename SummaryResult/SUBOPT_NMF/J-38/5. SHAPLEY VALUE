Let ˆφ denote the estimated Shapley value using Equation (3), and φ denote the true Shapley value.
Theorem 3.
We note that the term can be treated as a game among attributes, as it assigns a value to each coalition S ⊆ N. Without loss of generality, renumber attributes j(1) through j(kj ) as 1 through kj.
, j(kj ).
We will evaluate a specific heuristic that is  analogous to Equation (1).
For a coalition S ⊆ N , the aggregator for the first evaluates to 1 if and only if |S ∩ B| ≥ b , and similarly ,
