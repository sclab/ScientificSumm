Interestingly, it also emerged that the class of structured item graphs is properly contained in the class of instances having bounded hypertree width (hence, the reason of their intractability is not their generality).
In particular, this Award  allowed Gottlob to invite G. Greco for a research visit to  Oxford.
Motivated by this result, we  investigated the use of hypertree decomposition (on the dual hypergraph associated with the scenario) and we shown that the problem is tractable on the class of those instances whose dual hypergraphs have bounded hypertree width.
In addition , G. Greco is supported by ICAR-CNR , and
