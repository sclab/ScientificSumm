We shed further lights on strict hypertree decompositions by discussing an interesting characterization based on the strict Robber and Marshals Game, defined by adapting the Robber and Marshals game defined in [6], which characterizes hypertree width.
Marshals move on the hyperedges of H , while the robber moves on nodes of H. The robber sees where the marshals intend to move , and reacts by moving to another node which is connected with its current position and through a path in G ( H ) which does not use any node contained in a hyperedge that is occupied by the
