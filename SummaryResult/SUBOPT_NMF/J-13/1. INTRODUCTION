(a) is an encoding for a combinatorial auction I0, B0 , where I0 = {I1, ..., I5}, and item(Bi) = hi, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.
The primal graph for H I0,B0 is reported in Figure 1.
Formally, a packing h for a hypergraph H is a set of  hyperedges of H such that for each pair h, h ∈ h with h = h , it holds that h ∩ h = ∅.
Let us note that the hypergraph representation H I , B of a combinatorial auction I , B is also useful to make the analogy between the winner
