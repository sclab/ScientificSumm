Hyperedges in HG are of three kinds: 1) for each x ∈ N, E(HG) contains the hyperedges: • Sx = {bsx} ∪ {nse x | e = (x, y) ∈ E}; • Tx = {btx} ∪ {nte x | e = (z, x) ∈ E}; • A1 x = {bdx, bx}, A2 x = {bdx, bx}, and A3 x = {bx, bx} -notice that these hyperedges induce a clique on the nodes {bx, bx, bdx}; 1 Detailed proofs can be found in the Appendix, available at www.mat.unical.it/∼ggreco/papers/ca.pdf.
Blocks of TD: First, we observe that TD must contain some special kinds of vertex.
