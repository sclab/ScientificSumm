Finally, it would be interesting to investigate the best methods for combining the document-level and sentence-level classifiers.
Since the simple bag-of-words representation at the document-level leads to a learned model that behaves somewhat like a context-specific prior dependent on the sender/receiver and general topic, a first choice would be to treat it as such when combining probability estimates with the sentence-level classifier.
Additionally, named entity tagging, time expressions, etc., seem likely candidates for features that can  further improve this task.
We are currently pursuing some of these avenues to see what additional gains these offer.
Such methods include alternate ways
