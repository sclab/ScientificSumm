This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18].
As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language.
Despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and translation disambiguation are the two major bottlenecks for CLIR [20].
[2] reports the enhancement on CLIR by post-translation expansion.
In addition, word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19].
Therefore , CLQS also plays
