In this paper, we propose to use CLQS as an alternative to query translation, and test its effectiveness in CLIR tasks.
Given a source query fq , a set of relevant queries }{ eq in the target language are recommended using the cross-lingual query suggestion system.
The resulting good performance of CLIR corresponds to the high quality of the suggested queries.
Then a monolingual IR system based on the BM25 model [23] is called using each }{ eqqâˆˆ as queries to retrieve documents.
However, objectively benchmarking a query suggestion system is not a trivial task.
Then the retrieved documents are re-ranked based on
