If the only monitors are E2E, ROP, and PRc, the discounted time, −nt rt e 0 , needed to punish a cheater increases at least as fast as the product of the temptations to cheat along the data path, ∏ −− ≥ 0 0 pathdataon 0 t rt i i i t rt e y e n π (1) Corollary.
If nodes share a minimum temptation to cheat , π/y , the discounted time needed to punish cheating increases at least exponentially in the length of the data path , n , −− ≥ 0 00 t rt nt rt e
