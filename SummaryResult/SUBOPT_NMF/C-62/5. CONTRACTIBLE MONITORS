With ROPc monitors, we can adapt this mechanism to maximize welfare.
Thus, at least one of these monitors must exist.
If L" is an optimal path in the graph with i removed, the profit flow to i is, ( ) ( ) ∈≠∈ +−− ', ' Lj j ijLj jLL ccququ , (6) where Lq and 'Lq are the qualities of the two paths.
Thus, innocent nodes are not punished.
It has the following useful property: Claim 4.
The two possibilities for monitor correspond to which node has the burden of proof.
Example 1.
By definition , any monitor that gives the source proof that the
