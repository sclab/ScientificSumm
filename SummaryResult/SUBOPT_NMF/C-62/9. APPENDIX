For induction, assume that subgame n + 1 maximizes local welfare.
That is, Ln is the set of possible routes from S to reach some node that has already moved.
If ( ) ( ) knlV , , is maximal over Ln , it is also maximal over the paths in Ln+1 that don '' t lead to n. This means that node n can choose some n small enough so that ( ) nlV , is maximal over Ln+1 , so the route will lead to k. Conversely , if ( ) ( ) knlV , , is not maximal
