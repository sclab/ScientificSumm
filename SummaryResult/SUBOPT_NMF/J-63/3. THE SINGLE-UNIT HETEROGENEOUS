Then vj(k) − ˆHj ≤ vj(k) − ˆLk ≤ 0.
(4) • Let j be a buyer matched with seller i by the  mechanism according to valuation vj and let the assigned bottom of the negotiation range (seller"s floor) be Li.
(9) Consider first the case were j is matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .
Now , since the optimal allocation ˆT∗ matches j with k rather than with i we have that ( V −i −j ) ∗ + ( ˆvj ( i ) − ci ) ≤ ˆV ∗ = ( ˆV −k −j
