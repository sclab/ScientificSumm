User profile data is propagated without  participation of the provider entity from the user entity to the TFE via the relay entity.
Our approach requires each entity in the distributed  architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e.
In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.
