In [19],  various approaches are integrated within a single architecture.
Some example applications, including peer-to-peer networks, distributed firewalls, and distributed computing in general, are listed in [13].
We have ruled out Secure Multi-Party Computation approaches mainly because of their complexity, and because the algorithm that is computed securely is not considered to be private in these approaches.
This is achieved via Secure Multi-Party Computation [6], or via random perturbation of the user data [20].
It is based on a  combination of tamper-proof hardware and various software  components.
More  recent related approaches are described in [18].
