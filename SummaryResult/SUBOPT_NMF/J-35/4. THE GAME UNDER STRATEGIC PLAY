If there are only $M in the system, we can restrict to threshold strategies Sk where k ≤ M + 1.
Clearly br(δ, SM ) ≤ M for all δ, so the best response function is at or below the equilibrium at M. If k ≤ M/n, every player will have at least k dollars and so will be unwilling to work and the best response is just 0.
However, these far from (stochastic) equilibrium strategies will not affect the equilibrium  behavior when n is large and deviations from stochastic  equilibrium are extremely rare.
For all M , there exists δ∗
