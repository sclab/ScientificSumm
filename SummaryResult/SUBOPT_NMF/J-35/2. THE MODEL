• vt ∈ {j | V t j Bt j = 1} denotes the agent chosen to satisfy the request.
In  addition, the time between requests served by a single player is also exponentially distributed.
Thus, if i is a standard agent, then ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 −α if i = vt 0 otherwise.
Such a utility function is a reasonable representation of the pleasure that some people get from the sense that they provide the music that everyone is playing.
Intuitively , if a is moderately large , they will
