We can in fact completely characterize the distribution d∗ .
Let ∆k m denote all distributions d ∈ ∆k such that E(d) = m (i.e., Pk j=0 d(j)j = m).
For definiteness, we consider the Euclidean distance.
For all > 0, all k, and all m, there exists n such that for all n > n and all states s ∈ Sk,n,mn, there exists a time t∗ (which may depend on k, n, m, and ) such that for t > t∗ , we have Pr(Xt,s,Sk,n,m, ) > 1 − .
This is a useful way of looking at the system
