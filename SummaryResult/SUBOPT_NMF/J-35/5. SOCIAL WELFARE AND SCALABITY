This gives existing agents no incentive to leave and rejoin as  newcomers.
Approaches that rely on adjusting the amount of money may require expensive system-wide computations (see [26] for an example), and must be carefully tuned to avoid creating incentives for agents to manipulate the  system by which this is done.
Similarly, halving the the cost of  fulfilling a request is equivalent to doubling the amount of money that everyone has.
Thus, given r, for each choice of k, there is a unique maximum entropy  distribution dk,r.
There may be an advantage in delaying a request , but it
