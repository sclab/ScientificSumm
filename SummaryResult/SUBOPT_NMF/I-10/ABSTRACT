Surprisingly some difficult boolean formulas are  better learned, given the same learning set, by a Multi agent system than by a single agent.
The resulting method SMILE (standing for Sound  Multiagent Incremental LEarning) is described and experimented here.
The  corresponding protocol is applied to supervised concept learning.

We extend this notion of consistency ( or soundness ) to the whole MAS and discuss how to obtain that , at any moment , a same consistent concept representation is
