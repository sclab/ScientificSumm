The following problems have been selected to experiment our protocol : ( i ) the multiplexer-11 with 9 irrelevant attributes : M11 9 , ( ii ) the 20-multiplexer M20 ( with 4 address bits and 16 data bits ) , ( iii ) a difficult parity problem ( see [ 4 ] ) the Xorp m : there must be an odd number of bits with value 1 in the p first attributes for the instance to be positive , the p others bits being irrelevant , and ( iv ) a simple DNF formula ( a âˆ§ b
