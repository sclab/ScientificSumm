H is coherent if all terms h are coherent, and H is complete if each element of E+ is covered by at least one term h of H. Each term is by construction the lgg (least general  generalization) of a subset of positives instances {e1, ..., en}[5], that is the most specific term covering {e1, ..., en}.
In the following, a hypothesis H for the target formula f is a list of terms h, each of them being a conjunction of atoms.
The update mechanism depends of the ongoing hypothesis H , the ongoing examples E+ and Eâˆ’ ,
