In mutual online concept  learning [14] the agents converge to a unique hypothesis, but each agent produces examples from its own concept  representation, thus resulting in a kind of synchronization rather than in pure concept learning.

In [10] each agent observes all the examples but only perceive a part of their representation.

In [ 11 ] the MAS performs a form of ensemble learning in which the agents are lazy learners ( no explicit
