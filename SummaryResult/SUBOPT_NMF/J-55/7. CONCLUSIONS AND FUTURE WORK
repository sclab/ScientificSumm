Another interesting set of open questions concerns aggregation auctions.
Finally, we remark that very little is known about the structure of the optimal competitive auction.
Second, we consider whether our techniques can be extended to find optimal auctions for greater numbers of bidders.
We conjecture that an optimal auction for any number of bidders lies within this class.
We leave  verification of this conjecture for future work.
We also show that Î¥3 is not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction , but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive ratio of the
