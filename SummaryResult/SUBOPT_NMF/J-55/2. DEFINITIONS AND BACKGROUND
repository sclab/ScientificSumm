DEFINITION 3.
The expected profit of the auction, E[A(b)], is the sum of the  expected payments made by each bidder, which we denote by pi(b) for bidder i.
2.3 Limited Supply Versus Unlimited Supply Following [8], throughout the remainder of this paper we will be making the assumption that n = , i.e., the number of bidders is equal to the number of units for sale.
In each random bid  vector B, each bid Bi is drawn i.i.d.
from the distribution such that Pr [ Bi ≥ s ] ≤ 1/s for all s ∈ S. In the two-bidder
