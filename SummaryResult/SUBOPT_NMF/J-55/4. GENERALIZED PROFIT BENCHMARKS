Evaluating the performance of any auction competing against Gs,t on this distribution will yield the following theorem.
We denote the optimal auction for three bidders against Gs,t as Υs,t 3 .
, sn) and defined as: Gs(b) = max 2≤k≤n skb(k).
Furthermore, we strongly suspect that for any number of bidders, the form of the optimal auction will be independent of the benchmark used. 
We can lower bound the competitive ratio of Υs,t 3 using the same worst-case distribution from [8] that we used against F(2) .
THEOREM 4.
Υs , t 3 is scale-invariant and symmetric
