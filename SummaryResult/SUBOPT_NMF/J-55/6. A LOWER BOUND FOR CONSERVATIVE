Base case (k = 0, hk = 1): A must raise revenue of at least rn on b = (1, .
, 1, 1, H): rn ≤ pH (b) + (n − 1)p1(b) = 1 + (n − 1) 1 0 xρb-1 (x)dx ≤ 1 + (n − 1) 1 0 ρb-1 (x)dx The second inequality follows from the conservatism of the  underlying auction.
For any particular k and H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, .

The base case follows trivially from
