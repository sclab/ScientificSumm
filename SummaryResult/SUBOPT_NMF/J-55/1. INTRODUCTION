To handle the problem of  designing and analyzing auctions where bidders may falsely declare their valuations to get a better deal, we will adopt the solution concept of truthful mechanism design (see, e.g., [9, 15, 13]).
The auction is performed by soliciting a sealed bid from each of the bidders and deciding on the allocation of units to bidders and the prices to be paid by the bidders.
In this framework for competitive analysis , an auction is said to be β-competitive if it achieves a profit that is within a factor of β ≥ 1 of the benchmark profit
