We guess (and later verify) that this distribution is the worst-case input distribution for three bidders as well.
Since this distribution has full support over the set of all bid vectors and a worst-case distribution puts positive probability only on worst-case inputs, we can therefore assume that all but a  measure zero set of inputs is worst-case for the optimal auction.
The auction must raise  expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids.
The feasibility problem which arises from the linear optimization problem by assuming the constraints are tight is as follows : a ( y ) + a
