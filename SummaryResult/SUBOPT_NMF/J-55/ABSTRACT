Applying this technique to our optimal auction for three items, we achieve an auction with a competitive ratio of 3.25, which improves upon the previously best-known competitive ratio of 3.39 from [7].
Third, we propose a schema for converting a given limited-supply auction into an unlimited supply auction.
Second, we show that the form of this auction is independent of the  competitive framework used.
Finally , we generalize a result from [ 8 ] and extend our understanding of the nature of the optimal competitive auction by showing that the optimal competitive auction occasionally offers prices that are higher than
