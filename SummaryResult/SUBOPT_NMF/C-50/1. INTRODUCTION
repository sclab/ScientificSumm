In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined  storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store  important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.
180 CenWits employs several important mechanisms to  address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.
Furthermore, since there is no need for a  connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.
Using groups and partitions , the
