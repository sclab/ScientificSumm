A simpler scheme  incurs lesser energy cost as compared to a more sophisticated scheme, but offers lesser memory savings as well.
The last node, of course, chooses the node with the lowest id as its successor.
If group members are low on battery, then the group can adapt a scheme that is more energy efficient.
This is done to make sure that a single node does not run out of battery due to continuous exchange of information.
Thus the information is fully replicated on all nodes to maintain the correct view of the world.
As the group moves through the
