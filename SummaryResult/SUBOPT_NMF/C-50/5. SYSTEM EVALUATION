Thus, a single  alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters.
Since, a Mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a Mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.
On encountering another hiker, a sensor node transmits 50 witness records and receives 50 new  witness records.
Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and  assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.
Assuming that a node emits
