It is designed for an intermittently  connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.
A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.
The paper  describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.
A prototype of CenWits has been implemented using Berkeley Mica2 motes.
