An image processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes.
The localization accuracy ranges from 2 ft to 5 ft while the localization time ranges from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes.
For matching a node ID to a location we propose a constraint-based label relaxation algorithm.

In the StarDust framework, sensor nodes are equipped with optical retro-reflectors.
We evaluate the performance of a localization system based on our framework
