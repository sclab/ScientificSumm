The main contributions of our work are the following.
Through image processing techniques, the locations of the retro-reflectors (i.e., sensor nodes) is  deter57 mined.
GPS ranging hardware consumes energy, it is  relatively expensive (if high accuracy is required) and poses form factor challenges that move us away from the vision of dust size sensor nodes.
We develop a sensor node  hardware prototype, called a SensorBall.
Solutions that use the radio transceiver for ranging either have not produced encouraging results (if the received signal strength indicator is used) or are sensitive to environment (e.g., multipath).
