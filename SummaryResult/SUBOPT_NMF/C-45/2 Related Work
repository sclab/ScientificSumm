Sensor nodes use primarily connectivity information for inferring proximity to a set of anchors.
These have been  emphasized by several studies [14] [15] [16].
The Gradient algorithm [19], leverages the knowledge about the network density to infer the average one hop length.
A cooperative ranging that  attempts to achieve a global positioning from distributed local optimizations is proposed in [12].
In a similar manner, the Lighthouse system [22] uses a parallel light beam, that is emitted by an anchor which rotates with a certain period.
The PushPin project [ 8 ] uses the TDoA between ultrasound pulses and light flashes
