The reflectivity of each CCR (there are tens molded in the plastic container) is extremely low, and each CCR is not built with mirrors.
The difference: Figure  10Figure 11 Higher quality (better mirrors) would translate in more  accurate image processing (better sensor node detection) and smaller form factor for the optical component (an array of CCRs with a smaller area can be used).
The self-righting capabilities are necessary in order to orient the CCR predominantly upwards.
We remark here the low quality of the CCRs we used.
A reflective effect is achieved by employing finely polished plastic surfaces.
