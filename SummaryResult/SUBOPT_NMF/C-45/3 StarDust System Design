First, let us define G = (Λ,E) to be the weighted  connectivity graph built by the Central device from the received neighbor table information.
This mapping is known prior to the sensor node deployment (from node manufacturing).
It is interesting to observe that there is an entire spectrum of possibilities for how to partition the set of sensor nodes in equivalence classes (where an equivalence class is  represented by one color), in order to maximize the success of the localization algorithm.
In G the edge ( λi , λj ) has a 61 λ1 λ2 ... λN ni nj gi2
