Specifically, we want to experimentally verify our intuition that assigning more nodes to a color can benefit the localization accuracy, by enforcing more constraints, as opposed to uniquely  assigning a color to a single node.
In this section we investigate the effect unique colors have on the localization accuracy.
The experimental results are depicted in Figure 20 (localization error) and Figure 21 (percentage of sensor node correctly localized).
Also, for a given size of the coloring space (e.g., 6 colors available), if more colors are uniquely assigned to sensor nodes then the localization accuracy decreases.
The results are depicted in
