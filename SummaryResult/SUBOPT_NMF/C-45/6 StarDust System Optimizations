69 6.2 Location Learning If after several iterations of the algorithm, none of the  label probabilities for a node ni converges to a higher value, the confidence in our labeling of that node is relatively low.
6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in  extremely rugged environments.
It would be interesting to associate with a node , more than one label ( implicitly more than one location ) and defer the label assignment decision until events are detected in the network ( if the network was
