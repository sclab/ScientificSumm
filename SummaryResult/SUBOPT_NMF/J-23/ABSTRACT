Informally, the frugality ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired payment bound.
We study the relationships between the different payment bounds, both for  general set systems and for specific set-system auctions, such as path auctions and vertex-cover auctions.
The ratio captures the extent to which the  mechanism overpays, relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction.
We use these new definitions in the proof of our main result for vertex-cover auctions via a  bootstrapping technique, which may be of independent interest.
In this paper , we propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction
