The inequalities in (2) are bAB + bBC ≤ cAC = 1, bBC + bCD ≤ cBD = 1.
Now, if the goal is to maximise bAB + bBC + bCD, the best choice is bAB = bCD = 1, bBC = 0, so NTUmax(c) = 2.
The inequalities in (2) are the same as in the previous example, and by the same argument both of them are, in fact, equalities.
There is an instance of the shortest-path  problem for which we have NTUmin(c)/TUmin(c) ≥ 2.
Consider the graph of Figure 1 with the edge costs cAB = cBC = cCD = 0, cAC = cBD = 1.
