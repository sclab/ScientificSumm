We  define TUmax(c), NTUmin(c), NTUmax(c) and ν(c) similarly, though we will see in Section 6.3 that, in fact, NTUmin(c, S) and NTUmax(c, S) are independent of the choice of S. Note that the quantity ν(c) from [16] is NTUmin(c).
For concreteness, we will take TUmin(c) to be TUmin(c, S) where S is the  lexicographically least amongst the cheapest feasible sets.

Hence , TUmax ( c , S ) and NTUmax ( c , S ) are solutions to linear programs , and therefore can be computed in polynomial
