Any optimal solution has bx = 0 (by constraint in (2) with T0).
REMARK 5.
But TUmin(c, S2) ≤ 3 as we can set b2 = 1, b3 = 2, b4 = 0.
Indeed, it can be argued that φNTUmin is the best definition of frugality ratio, because among all  reasonable payment bounds (i.e., ones that are at least as large as the cost of the cheapest feasible set), it is most demanding of the algorithm.
, n, and suppose that F = {S, T1, .
Intuitively , a good payment bound should satisfy this monotonicity requirement , as adding a feasible set increases the competition
