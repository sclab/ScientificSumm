Consider a network (VΓ, EΓ) such that VΓ = V ∪{s, t}, EΓ = E1 ∪E2 ∪E3, where E1 = {(s, v) | v ∈ S}, E2 = {(v, w) | v ∈ S, w ∈ 341 V \ S, (v, w) ∈ E}, E3 = {(w, t) | w ∈ V \ S}.
Set the capacity constraints for e ∈ EΓ as follows : a ( s , v ) = cv , a ( w , t ) = cw , a ( v , w ) = +∞ for all v ∈ S , w ∈ V \ S. Recall that a cut is a partition
