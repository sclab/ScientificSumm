1.1 Our results Vertex cover auctions We propose a truthful polynomial-time auction for vertex cover that outputs a solution whose cost is within a factor of 2 of optimal, and whose frugality ratio is at most 2Δ, where Δ is the maximum degree of the graph (Theorem 4).
We complement this result by proving (Theorem 5) that for any Δ and n, there are graphs of maximum degree Δ and size Θ(n) for which any truthful mechanism has frugality ratio at least Δ/2.
This graph is 2-connected and the VCG payment to the winning path ABCD is bounded.
