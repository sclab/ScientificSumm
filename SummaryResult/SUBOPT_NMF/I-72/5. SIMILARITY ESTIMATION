• Parent versus sibling: A node would have higher similarity to its parent than to its sibling.
• Sibling versus grandparent: A node is more similar to it"s sibling then to its grandparent.
Here, the similarity between c1 and c2 is estimated and c0 is the most specific concept subsuming these classes.
For example, AnyWineColor is parent of ReddishColor and ReddishColor is parent of Red.
The equation (3) [8] shows Lin"s similarity where c1 and c2 are the compared concepts and c0 is the most specific concept that subsumes both of them.
