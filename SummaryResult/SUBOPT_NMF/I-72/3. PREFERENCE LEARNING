Incrementally, G specializes and S generalizes until G and S are equal to each other.
When a positive sample comes, the most specific set S should be generalized in order to cover the new training instance.
On the other hand, we need to learn disjunctive concepts in the negotiation of a service since consumer may have several  alternative wishes.
In the DCEA, we generalize it as {(Light, Delicate, [White, Red] )}.
),  meaning the color can take any value.
The modified algorithm, DCEA, is given as Algorithm 1.
However , we do not eliminate the hypotheses in G that do not cover
