Convergence Property 2 (CP2).
To explore alternative solutions to these properties, we explicitly state the Pre-Conditions (PC) for CP1, CP2, IP2, and IP3 as follows: 
COT is a high-level control algorithm responsible for  determining which operation should be transformed against other operations and in which order according to  contextbased conditions.
Given a document state DS , and operations Oa , Ob , if Oa = IT ( Oa , Ob ) , and Ob = IT ( Ob , Oa ) , then it must be : DS ◦ [ Oa , Ob ] = DS ◦ [ Ob ,
