Context-independency relation  c  Given two original operations Oa and Ob, Oa and Ob are context-independent, denoted by Oa c Ob, iff neither Oa c → Ob, nor Ob c → Oa.
This is because any operation has a context, but only original operations can be included in a context.
CC1 ensures that O is always executed after the  contextdependent operations included in C(O).
When O is an original inverse operation, C(O) must include the operation to be undone by O (see Definition 4-Item 2), so CC1 preserves the do-undo ordering among normal and inverse operations [21].
