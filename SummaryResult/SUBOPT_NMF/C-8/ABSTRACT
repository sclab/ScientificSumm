The COT algorithm is capable of supporting both do and undo of any  operations at anytime, without requiring transformation functions to preserve Reversibility Property, Convergence Property 2, Inverse Properties 2 and 3.
In this paper, we report the main  results of this effort: the theory of operation context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
The COT algorithm is not only simpler and more efficient than prior OT control algorithms, but also simplifies the design of transformation functions.
After having designed , implemented , and experimented with a series of OT algorithms , we reflected on what had been learned and
