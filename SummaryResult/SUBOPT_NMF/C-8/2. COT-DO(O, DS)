Then, COT-DO is invoked with parameters O2 and DS.
First, O2 and C(O2) = {O2} are created.
This example shows that an  inverse operation can be handled by COT-DO in the same way as other normal operations.
This is because context-based conditions CC1 - CC6 are uniformly applicable to both  normal and inverse operations.
The basic COT algorithm is simple yet powerful -  capable of doing and undoing any operations at anytime.
Inside COT-DO, transform(O2, DS − C(O2)) shall be invoked, and O2 shall be correctly transformed against O1 and O3 since CD = DS − C(O2) = {O1, O3}.
