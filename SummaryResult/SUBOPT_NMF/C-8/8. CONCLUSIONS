The theory of operation context and the COT algorithm shall serve as new  foundations for addressing the technical challenges in existing and emerging OT applications.
The COT algorithm provides  uniformed solutions to both consistency maintenance and undo problems; it is simpler and more efficient than prior OT  control algorithms with similar capabilities; and it significantly simplifies the design of transformation functions.
Real-world applications provide exciting opportunities and challenges to future OT research.
The COT algorithm has been implemented in a generic collaboration engine and used for supporting a range of novel collaborative applications [24].
The theory of operation context is
