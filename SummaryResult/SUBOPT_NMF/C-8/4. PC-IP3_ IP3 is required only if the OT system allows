Counterexamples illustrating the violation of these properties in some early published transformation functions can be found in [23, 21, 8, 11].
Past research has shown that it is relatively easy to  design transformation functions capable of preserving CP1, but non-trivial to design and formally prove transformation functions capable of preserving CP2, IP2 and IP3.
284 There are generally two ways to achieve OT correctness with respect to these transformation properties: one is to design transformation functions capable of preserving these properties; the other is to design control algorithms capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties.
