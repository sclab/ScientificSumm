The dOPT algorithm was the first OT algorithm and was based solely on the concurrency relationships among operations [4]: a pair of operations are transformable as long as they are  concurrent.
This puzzle was solved in various ways, but the theory of causality as well as its limitation were inherited by all follow-up OT algorithms.
After having designed , implemented , and experimented with a series of OT algorithms of increased complexity , we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a uniformed theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems , reducing its complexity
