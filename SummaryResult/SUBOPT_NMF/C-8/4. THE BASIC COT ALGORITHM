Remove Ox from CD, where C(Ox) ⊆ C(O); 2. transform(Ox, C(O) − C(Ox)); 3.
When O2 arrives with C(O2) = {}, transform(O2, DS1− C(O2)) is called, where DS1 − C(O2) = {O1}.
After the generation of O1, since C(O1) = DS0, O1 is executed as-is and DS0 is updated to DS1 = {O1}.
The procedure transform() is recursively invoked to transform Ox against operations in C(O)−C(Ox) (CC5).
Procedure 1. transform(O, CD) Repeat until CD = { }: 1.
When O3 arrives with C ( O3 ) = { O2 } , transform ( O3
