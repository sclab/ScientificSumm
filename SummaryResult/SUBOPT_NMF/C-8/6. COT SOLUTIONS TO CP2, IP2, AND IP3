Under the control of COT, the IP3-safe inverse O shall never be transformed against operations that are context-independent of O, thus breaking PC-IP3.
6.3 Breaking the pre-condition for IP2 The basic idea of the COT solution to IP2 is to make sure that an operation is never transformed against a pair of do and undo operations one by one, thus breaking  PCIP2.
The make IP3safe Inverse procedure works as follows : ( 1 ) create operation O ( the inverse of O ) and C ( O ) = C ( O ) âˆ’ 285 { O } ; (
