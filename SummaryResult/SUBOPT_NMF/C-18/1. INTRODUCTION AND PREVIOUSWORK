Biologists, and computer scientists in the field of  artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and 323 attempted to create models that explain how the elements of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve.
Moreover, in recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETS), the design of  Intrusion Detection Systems, the study of traffic patterns in transportation systems, in military applications, and other areas, see [3].
Local Communication Mechanisms: Agents interact with other members in the swarm via simple local communication mechanisms.
