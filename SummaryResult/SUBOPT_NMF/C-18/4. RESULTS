In this set of simulation runs, a network  topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.
In addition, the following  observations can be made.

Address Scanning : • Random : = addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space , namely , a 224 address space ; and • Local Bias : =
