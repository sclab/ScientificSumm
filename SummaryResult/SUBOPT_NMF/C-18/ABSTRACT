In our work, we put forth the hypothesis that next  generation worms will be radically different, and potentially such techniques will prove ineffective.
In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of Swarm Worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a swarm worm.
Specifically, we  propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence.
