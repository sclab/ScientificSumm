Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were  selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
All shared passwords are distributed randomly across all nodes.
Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were  selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets.
At the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero.
For example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts.
In the case of a simple local area network of 30
