In addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called ZachiK.
This work opens up a new area of interesting problems.
Preliminary results showed that such worms is capable of compromising hosts a rates up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than its generic counterpart while retaining stealth capabilities.
Such Swarm Worms are potentially more  harmful than their generic counterparts.
Such a swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node  topology.
Swarm Worms behave very much like biological swarms and
