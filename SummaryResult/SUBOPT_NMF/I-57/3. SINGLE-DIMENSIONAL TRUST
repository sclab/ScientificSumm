3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is  derived from an unsuccessful outcome.
We assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 .
The utility based approach that we present here provides an  attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al.
4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].
This contract will lead to some outcome , o , and we consider that o = 1
