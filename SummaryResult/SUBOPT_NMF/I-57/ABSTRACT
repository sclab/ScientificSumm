Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems.
We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions.
We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised  reputation system.
This solution uses the notion of private and shared information , and provides estimates consistent with
