This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract  outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of  contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).
a and b ) , the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes , N , which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution , given by : N = < nab ij > ∀a , b , i ∈ { 0 , 1 } , j ∈ { 0 , 1 } ( 18 ) Thus , an agent is able
