Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3].
For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0.
Likewise , we can
