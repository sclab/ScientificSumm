Our future work in this area is to extend the exchange of  reputation to the case where contracts are not homogeneous.
That is, not all agents observe the same contract dimensions.
We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate  reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems.
This is a challenging extension, since in this case, the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution can not be used directly.
Our starting point was an agent estimating the expected utility of a contract
