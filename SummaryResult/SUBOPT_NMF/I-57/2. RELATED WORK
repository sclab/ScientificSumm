The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.
By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more  principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.
He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.
However , the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is
