Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅.
To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .
Thus , it updates its vector according to the procedure below : - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agent '' s shared vector represents a greater number
