However, the resulting DIDS integrates heterogeneous IDSs whereas the DIDSs upon Grids presented by Leu et al.
[6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous IDSs.
The architecture comprises of several components for: monitoring, correlation, intrusion detection by statistics, detection by signatures and answers.
In contrast, DIDSoG uses the Grid to compose a DIDS by integrating specific IDSs; the resulting DIDS could however be used to identify attacks in a Grid environment.
[ 6 ] and [ 7 ] propose the use of Globus Toolkit for intrusion detection , especially for DoS ( Denial of Service ) and DDoS
