The proposed model enables heterogeneous IDSs to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed DIDSoG (Distributed Intrusion Detection System on Grid).
OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational Grids.
Different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].
Grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.
Some functions provided by Grid middleware are [ 3 ] : ( i ) data management services , including access services , replication , and localisation
