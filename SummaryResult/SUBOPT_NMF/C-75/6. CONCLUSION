In contrast, the proposed model developed and simulated in this work, can shed some light into the question of integration of heterogeneous IDSs.
In addition to the integration of IDSs enabled by a grid middleware, the cooperation of heterogeneous IDSs can be viewed as an economic problem.
Services for communication and localization were used to carry out the integration between components of different resources.
This capability demonstrates that the IDSs integrated have resulted in a DIDS.
The components of the architecture of the DIDSoG were developed and evaluated using the GridSim Grid simulator.
However , none deals with the integration
