The distinction between complexity levels can also be organized in order to integrate different techniques of intrusion detection.
The complexity level 1 could be defined for analyses based on signatures, which are simpler techniques; the complexity level 2 for techniques based on behaviour, that require greater computational power; and the complexity level 3 for intrusion detection in applications, where the techniques are more specific and depend on more data.
The DIDSoG allows different levels to be managed by different entities.
The second scope, comprising several hosts of a domain can be managed by the administrator of the domain.
