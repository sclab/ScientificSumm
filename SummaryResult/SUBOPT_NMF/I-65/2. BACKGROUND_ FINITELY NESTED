If j"s model is subintentional, then j"s probable  observations are appended to the observation history contained in the model.
SMj is the set of subintentional models of j.
Second, changes in j"s models have to be included in i"s belief update.
Agent i '' s optimal action , a∗ i , for the case of finite horizon with discounting , is an element of the set of optimal actions for the belief state , OPT ( θi ) , defined as : OPT ( bi , l , θi ) = argmax
