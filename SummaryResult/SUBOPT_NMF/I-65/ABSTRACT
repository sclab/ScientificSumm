I-DIDs may be used to compute the policy of an agent online as the agent acts and observes in a setting that is populated by other interacting agents.
Using several examples, we show how I-DIDs may be applied and demonstrate their usefulness.
I-DIDs generalize DIDs, which may be viewed as graphical representations of POMDPs, to multiagent settings in the same way that I-POMDPs generalize POMDPs.

These graphical models called interactive dynamic influence diagrams ( I-DIDs ) seek to explicitly model the structure that is often present in
