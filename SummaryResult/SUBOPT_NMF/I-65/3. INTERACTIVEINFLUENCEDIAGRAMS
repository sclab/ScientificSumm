node, I-IDs differ from IDs by having a dashed link (called the policy link in [15]) between the model node and a chance node, Aj, that represents the distribution over the other agent"s actions given its model.
(c) The transformed I-ID with the model node replaced by the chance nodes and the relationships between them.
Each decision node is mapped to the corresponding chance node , say A1 j , in the following way : if OPT is the set of optimal actions obtained by solving the I-ID ( or ID ) , then Pr ( aj âˆˆ
