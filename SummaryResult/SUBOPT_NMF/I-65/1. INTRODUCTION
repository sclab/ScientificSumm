NIDs extend MAIDs to include agents" uncertainty over the game being played and over models of the other agents.
MAIDs objectively  analyze the game, efficiently computing the Nash equilibrium profile by exploiting the independence structure.
I-DIDs address this gap by allowing the representation of other agents" models as the values of a special model node.
In the previous representation of the I-DID , the update of the agent '' s belief over the models of others as the agents act and receive observations was denoted using a special link called the model update link that connected the model
