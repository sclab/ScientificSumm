We are currently investigating ways to solve I-DIDs approximately with provable bounds on the solution quality.

I-DIDs may be seen as concise graphical representations for  IPOMDPs providing a way to exploit problem structure and carry out online decision-making as the agent acts and observes given its prior beliefs.
I-DIDs extend NIDs to allow sequential decision-making over multiple time steps in the presence of other interacting agents.
work significantly by being more transparent , semantically
