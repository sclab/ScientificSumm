For simplicity, we assume that the cost of punishing is same for both the agents.
Let ci = cj, cp > 0, and if P > XT âˆ’ ciXT , then  defection is no longer a dominating action.
We assume that ci < 1 so that the agent does not benefit enough that it contributes to the public pot for private gain.
We formulate a sequential version of the PG problem with  punishment from the perspective of agent i.
Specifically, our altruistic agent has a high  marginal private return (cj is close to 1) and does not punish others who defect.
