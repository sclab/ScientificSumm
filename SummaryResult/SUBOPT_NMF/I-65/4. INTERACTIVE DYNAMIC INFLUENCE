For t from 1 to T − 1 do 2.
If l ≥ 1 then Populate Mt+1 j,l−1 3.
In order to obtain the probability of j"s possible observation, we introduce the chance node Oj, which depending on the value of Mod[Mt j ] assumes the distribution of the observation node in the lower level model  denoted by Mod[Mt j ].
Consequently, each of j"s subintentional or level 0  models (represented using a standard DID) in the first time step must be solved to obtain its optimal set of actions.
Next , we describe how
