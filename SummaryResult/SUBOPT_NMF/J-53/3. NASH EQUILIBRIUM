Thus, the equal-weight game is ideal as the efficiency, utility uniformity, and the  envyfreeness are all 1.
The situation is different for the opposite game in which the two users put the exact opposite weights on the two machines.
User i can ensure a utility of 1/m by distributing his budget proportionally to the current bids.
Hence, the total money on each machine is n + 1.
That is , user i , by bidding sij = Xi/ Pn i=1 Si on machine j , obtains a resource level of : rij = sij sij + Sj = Sj/ Pn i=1
