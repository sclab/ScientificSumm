Compute U(A) by the infinite parallelism best response algorithm (Sec 4.1) on A.
Intuitively, by the local search heuristic, we test if we can swap a machine in A for one not in A to improve the best  response utility.
We suspect that the local maxima that this algorithm finds is also the global maximum (with  respect to an individual user) and that this process stop after a few number of iterations, but we are unable to establish it.
We do assume that the user still has a way to measure his utility , which is the minimum assumption
