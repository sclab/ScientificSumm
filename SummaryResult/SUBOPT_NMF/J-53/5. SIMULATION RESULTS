When the parallelism bound is large (âˆ† = 20), the performance is closer to the infinite parallelism model, and we do not observe this drop in performance. 
When the system does not converge, we measure performance by taking the  minimum value we observe after running for many iterations.
High competition also allows convergence because each user"s decision has only a small impact on other users, so the system is more stable and can gradually reach convergence.
These results demonstrate the tradeoff between the  different allocation methods.
The same is true with respect to envy-freeness.
