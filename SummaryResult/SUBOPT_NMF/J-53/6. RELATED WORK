uses a reservation abstraction similar to the way airline seats are allocated.
Bellagio[3] uses the SHARE centralized allocator.
Their  methodology follows the study of congestion (potential) games [17, 22] by relating the Nash equilibrium to the solution of a (usually convex) global optimization problem.
We view scheduling and resource allocation as two separate functions.

SHARE allocates resources using a centralized combinatorial auction that allows users to express preferences with  complementarities.
There have been several analyses [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 23 ] of variations of price-anticipating allocation schemes in
