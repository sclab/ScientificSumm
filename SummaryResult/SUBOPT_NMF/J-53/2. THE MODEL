We call this the infinite parallelism model.
In practice, a user"s application may have an inherent limit on parallelization (e.g., some computations must be done sequentially) or there may be a system limit (e.g., the application"s data is being served from a file server with limited capacity).
Then player 1 should never bid on machine 2 because it has no value to him.
Under such a condition, we have that (see [5] for a proof), Theorem 1.
The  efficiency at an allocation scheme ω is defined as π(ω) = U(ω) U∗ .
This can be shown
