Utility uniformity, which is common in Computer Science work, measures the closeness of utilities of different users.
• We describe algorithms that allow strategic users to optimize their utility.
For evaluating the Nash equilibria, we consider both their efficiency, measuring how close the social welfare at equilibrium is to the social  optimum, and fairness, measuring how different the users"  utilities are.
• We show that the price-anticipating resource  allocation mechanism achieves a high degree of  efficiency and fairness.
Surprisingly , the Nash equilibrium , reached by each user iteratively applying the best response algorithm to adapt his bids ,
