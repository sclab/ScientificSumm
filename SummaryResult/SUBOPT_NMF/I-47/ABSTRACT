In the realm of software architectures, the paper proposes a connector-based model of multi-agent interactions which attempts to identify the essential structure underlying multi-agent interactions.
The main hypothesis motivating this paper is that the variety of multi-agent  interaction mechanisms - both, organizational and  communicative, share a common semantic core.
Furthermore, the paper also provides this model with a formal execution semantics which describes the dynamics of social interactions.
The proposed model is intended as the  abstract machine of an organizational programming language which allows programmers to accommodate an open set of interaction mechanisms.
