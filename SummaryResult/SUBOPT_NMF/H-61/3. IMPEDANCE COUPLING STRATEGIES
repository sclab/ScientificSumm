This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.
In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.
With each node is associated a binary random variable , which takes the value 1 to mean that the corresponding entity ( a page or terms ) is observed and
