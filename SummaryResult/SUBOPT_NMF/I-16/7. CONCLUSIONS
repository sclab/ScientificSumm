Its performance closely approached that of a central optimal allocation, with  perfect knowledge of the arrival and departure of users, despite the uncertain environment in which the strategy must operate.
In this paper, we presented an advanced bidding strategy for use by advertising agents within the BluScreen advertising system.
We presented an algorithm based upon simulated annealing to solve for the optimal bidding strategy, and in simulation, this bidding strategy was shown to significantly outperform a simple bidding strategy that had none of these features.
This bidding strategy enabled advertising agents to model and predict the arrival and departure of
