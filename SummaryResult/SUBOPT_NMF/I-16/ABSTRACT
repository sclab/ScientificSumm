We evaluate the effectiveness of this bidding agent through simulation against a range of alternative selection mechanisms including a simple bidding strategy, random allocation, and a centralised optimal allocation with perfect  foresight.
Our bidding agent significantly outperforms both the simple bidding strategy and the random allocation, and in a mixed  population of agents it is able to expose its adverts to 25% more users than the simple bidding strategy.
Moreover, its performance is within 7.5% of that of the centralised optimal allocation despite the highly uncertain environment in which it must operate.
