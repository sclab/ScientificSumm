exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).
Thus , the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by : u2 = P ( b2 ) [ P ( b1 ) N0,0 + ( 1 âˆ’ P ( b1 ) ) Nn , tc ] ( 7 ) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was
