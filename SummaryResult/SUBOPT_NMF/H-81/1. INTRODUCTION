These recommendations are based on accurate knowledge of the descriptors' behaviour and the description structures.
Common rules are distance functions, like the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance.
From the MPEG-7 tests and the recommendations it does not become clear, how many and which distance measures have been tested on the visual descriptors and the MPEG-7 test datasets.
The MPEG-7 descriptors have been carefully designed to meet - partially  complementaryrequirements of different application domains: archival, browsing, retrieval, etc.
However, the MPEG-7 authors give recommendations, which distance measure to use on a particular descriptor.
Unfortunately , the MPEG-7 standard does not include
