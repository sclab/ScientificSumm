The pattern difference measure implements this insight in the most consequent way.
It can be seen that the best overall measure is a predicate-based one.
The second best group of measures are the MPEG-7 recommendations, which have a slightly higher mean but a lower standard deviation than pattern difference.
For this descriptor the second indicator is up to eight times higher than for predicate-based measures on other descriptors.
5.3 Other interesting results Distance measures that perform in average worse than others may in certain situations (e.g.
Additional advantages of pattern difference are that it usually has a very low variance
