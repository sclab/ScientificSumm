If multiple descriptors are used (e.g.

If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.
But they do not change the characteristics of the extracted information.

Consequently, the process is independent of the employed querying paradigm (e.g.
Iteration for multiple candidates allows
