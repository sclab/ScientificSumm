Three media collections were created and assessed, performance indicators developed and more than 22500 tests performed.
Additionally, a quantisation model was developed to be able to use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well.
The evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in the MPEG-7-standard are among the best but that other measures perform even better.
Eight visual MPEG-7 descriptors were selected and 38 distance measures implemented.

The evaluation presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures suggested by the MPEG-7 group for the visual descriptors can be beaten
