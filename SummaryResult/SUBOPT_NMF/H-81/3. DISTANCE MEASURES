This is easy to illustrate.
It is easy to show that for predicate data some quantitative distance measures degenerate to  predicatebased measures.
For the tests, it is important to notice, that all similarity measures were inverted to distance measures. 
0 1 .
If the identity matrix was used in this case, the Mahalanobis distance would degenerate to a Minkowski distance.
For both predicate data and quantitative data it can be shown that the quantisation model is reasonable.
In Q5, ii σµ , are mean and standard deviation for the elements of descriptor Xi.
The distance measure is then highly discriminant for properties
