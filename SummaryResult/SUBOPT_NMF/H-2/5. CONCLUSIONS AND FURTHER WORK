• We moved this personalized search framework further and proposed to make the expansion process adaptive to features of each query, a strong focus being put on its clarity level.
• We provided a thorough empirical analysis of several  variants of our approaches, under four different scenarios.
• Within a separate set of experiments, we showed our adaptive algorithms to provide an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best approach.
We showed some of these approaches to perform very well,  producing NDCG improvements of up to 51.28%.
