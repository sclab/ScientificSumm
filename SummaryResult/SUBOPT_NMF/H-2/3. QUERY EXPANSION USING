First , let us define the likelihood ratio for one hypothesis : λ = maxω∈Ω0 H ( ω ; k ) maxω∈Ω H ( ω ; k ) ( 4 ) where ω is a point in the parameter space Ω , Ω0 is the particular hypothesis being tested , and k is a point in the space of observations K. If we assume that two binomial distributions have the same underlying parameter , i.e. , { ( p1 , p2 ) | p1 = p2 } , we can write : λ = maxp H ( p , p
