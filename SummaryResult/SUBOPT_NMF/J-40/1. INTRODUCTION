There are many obvious reasons why one would like to examine more general graphs, the primary one being in that many scenarios considered in evolutionary game theory, all interactions are in fact not possible.
We generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ) to networks , and show a pair of complementary results that exhibit the power of randomization in our setting : subject to degree or edge density conditions , the classical ESS of any game are preserved when the graph is chosen randomly and the mutation set is chosen adversarially , or when the graph
