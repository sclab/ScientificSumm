Then with probability 1, s is an ESS with respect to F, G and M. 203 Proof.
Since s is an ESS of F, we know (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t), thus if we choose τ small enough, we can ensure that all but o(n) mutants of normal fitness have a neighboring incumbent of higher fitness.
The incumbents that they are attached to have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)].
We define the mutant degree of a vertex to be the number of mutant neighbors of that vertex , and
