Let M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be any family of subsets of vertices of the Gn such that |Mn| ≥ n for some constant > 0.
Definition 3.2.
Let > 0, and let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices.
If G is a graph representing the allowed pairwise  interactions between organisms (vertices), and u is a vertex of G playing strategy su, then the fitness of u is given by F(u) = P v∈Γ(u) F(su|sv) |Γ(u)| .
In Section A.1 we show that the definition given coincides with the classical one in
