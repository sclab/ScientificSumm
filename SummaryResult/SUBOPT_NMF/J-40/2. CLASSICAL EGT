If two organisms interact, one playing strategy s 200 and the other playing strategy t, the s-player earns a fitness of F(s|t) while the t-player earns a fitness of F(t|s).
In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a 1 âˆ’ fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t, and call these organisms mutants.
A strategy s is an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ESS ) for the 2-player , symmetric game given by fitness function F , if for every strategy t = s , there
