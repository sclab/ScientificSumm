(Sketch) With probability approaching 1 as n → ∞, there exists a vertex j where deg(j) is arbitrarily close to n. So label j mutant, label one of its neighbors  incumbent, denoted i, and label the rest of j"s neighborhood mutant.
Theorem 6.2.
If we assume that we adopt this notion of contraction for individual mutants, and require that all incumbent-mutant edges contract, we will next show that Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 still hold, and thus it is still impossible to get results such as Theorems 5.1 and 5.3 which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game.
