Our work differs from theirs in that we do not  constrain the dependency to be linear.
The hierarchy within a topic does impose a structure on the topic, but we do not know of an effort to explore the extent to which that structure  reflects the underlying event relationships.
Barzilay and Lee [5] proposed a content structure modeling technique where topics within text are learnt using unsupervised methods, and a linear order of these topics is modeled using hidden Markov models.
Another area of research that looks at the structure within a topic is hierarchical text classification of topics [
