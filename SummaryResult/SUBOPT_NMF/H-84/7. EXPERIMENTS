We see that while all the algorithms except MST outperform the baseline complete-link algorithm , the nearest Parent algorithm is statistically significant from the baseline in terms of its DF-value using a one-tailed paired T-test at 95% confidence level.

The  results throw some surprises: The nearest parent model, which was significantly better than the baseline on training set, turns out to be worse than the baseline on the test set.
