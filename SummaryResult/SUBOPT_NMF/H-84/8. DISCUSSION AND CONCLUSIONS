Hence, we should focus not only on improving dependencies but also on clustering at the same time.
We developed a  timedecay based clustering approach that takes advantage of  temporallocalization of news stories on the same event and showed that it performs significantly better than the baseline approach based on cosine similarity.
Errors in clustering have a magnifying effect on errors in  dependencies as we have seen in our experiments.
However, the performance deteriorates rapidly if the system has to discover the events by itself.
Our results indicate modeling dependencies can be a very hard problem especially when the clustering performance
