This involves starting with a small random subset of the edges, and then adding positive price edges one-by-one until none remain.
Furthermore, the  unrestricted clearing problem can be solved in polynomial time (recall Section 4).
Hence, we can efficiently compute an upper bound on the master LP relaxation, and, whenever the restricted primal achieves this upper bound, we have proven optimality without necessarily having to eliminate all positive-price columns!
This last approach outperforms the heuristic seeders  described above.
5.2.3 Proving Optimality Recall that our aim is to find an optimal solution to the master LP relaxation.
