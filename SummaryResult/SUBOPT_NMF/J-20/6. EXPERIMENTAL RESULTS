Figure 6 shows the runtime performance of four clearing algorithms.
The first algorithm is CPLEX on the full cycle  formulation.
As in many column generation problems, the tailing-off effect is substantial.
By taking advantage of the properties of our problem, we manage to clear a market with 10,000 patients in about the same time it would otherwise have taken to clear a 6000 patient market. 
For each market size listed, we randomly  generated 10 markets, and attempted to clear them using each of the algorithms.
Finally , we restore the seeder to its optimized setting , but this time ,
