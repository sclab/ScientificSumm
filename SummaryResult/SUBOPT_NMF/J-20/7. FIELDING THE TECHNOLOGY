We are in discussions with additional kidney exchanges that are interested in adopting our  technology.
While there are (for political/inter-personal reasons) at least four kidney exchanges in the US currently, everyone understands that a unified unfragmented national exchange would save more lives.
This way our technology (and the processes around it) will hopefully serve as a substrate that will eventually help in unifying the exchanges.
At least computational  scalability is no longer an obstacle. 
Our algorithm and implementation replaced CPLEX as the clearing algorithm of the Alliance for Paired Donation, one of the leading kidney exchanges, in December 2006.
