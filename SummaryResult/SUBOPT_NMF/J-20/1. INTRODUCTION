Figure 1 illustrates an example market with 5 agents, {v1, v2, .
Due to such resource constraints, the upcoming national kidney exchange market will likely allow only cycles of length 2 and 3.
The  market has 4 cycles, c1 = v1, v2 , c2 = v2, v3 , c3 = v3, v4 and c4 = v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 , and two (inclusion) maximal  exchanges, namely M1 = {c4} and M2 = {c1, c3}.
â€¢ Second, an attractive feature of using an ILP  formulation is that it allows one to easily model a number of variations on the objective, and to add additional  constraints to the problem.
