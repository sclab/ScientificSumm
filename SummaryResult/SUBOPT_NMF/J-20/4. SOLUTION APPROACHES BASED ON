If so, we generate a set of these constraints, add them to the ILP, and repeat.
In these cases, CPLEX branches on a variable (we used CPLEX"s default branching strategy), and generates one new search node corresponding to each of the children.
Therefore, we use a tree search with an incremental  formulation approach.
4.1 Constraint Seeder The main constraint seeder we developed forbids any path of length L âˆ’ 1 that does not have an edge closing the cycle from its head to its tail.
In our first constraint generator , we simply search for length-L paths with
