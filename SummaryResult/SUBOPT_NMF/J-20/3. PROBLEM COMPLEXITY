Note that the construction only has short cycles of lengths 3 and L, and no short cycle involves distinct  vertices from two different gadgets.
We will show the  construction admits a perfect cycle cover by short cycles.
It is clear that this problem is in NP.
It is clear that all vertices are covered, since M partitions X × Y × Z. Conversely, suppose we have a perfect cover by short  cycles.
One straightforward idea is to construct a tripartite graph with vertex sets X ∪ Y ∪ Z and directed edges ( xa , yb ) , ( yb
