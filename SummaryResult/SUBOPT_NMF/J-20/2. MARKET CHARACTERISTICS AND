Table 1 gives lower and upper bounds on the size of a maximum-cardinality exchange in the kidney-exchange  market.
This means that the maximum-weight exchange has maximum cardinality.
Briefly, the process involves generating patients with a random blood type, sex, and probability of being tissue-type incompatible with a randomly chosen donor.
