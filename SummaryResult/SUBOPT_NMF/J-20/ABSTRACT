Solving it exactly is one of the main challenges in establishing a national kidney exchange.
The clearing problem involves finding a social welfare  maximizing exchange when the maximum length of a cycle is fixed.
Our algorithm replaced CPLEX as the clearing algorithm of the Alliance for Paired Donation, one of the leading  kidney exchanges.
We present the first algorithm capable of clearing these markets on a nationwide scale.
Long cycles are forbidden, since, for incentive reasons, all transplants in a cycle must be performed simultaneously.
The key is incremental  problem formulation.
We adapt two paradigms for the task : constraint
