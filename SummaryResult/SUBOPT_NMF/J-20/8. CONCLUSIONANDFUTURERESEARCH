We conclude that column generation scales dramatically better than  constraint generation.
In fact, some work has been done on this in certain restricted  settings [22, 24].
This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IIS-0427858 and CCF-0514922. 
Two important directions for future work are to explicitly address both online and limited-information aspects of the problem.
For column generation in the LP , our enhancements include pricing techniques , column seeding techniques , techniques for proving optimality without having to bring in all positive-price columns ( and using another column-generation process in a different formulation to
