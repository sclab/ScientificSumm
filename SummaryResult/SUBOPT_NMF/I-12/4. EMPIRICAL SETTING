The  rectangular area represents the probability of the user being engaged in this type of activity when she is randomly interrupted.
The testbed system enabled us to define either hand-crafted or automatically generated multi-rectangular distribution functions.
At each step of a simulation , each of the CAs samples its owner ( i.e. , all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate ) and then estimates the parameter ( either the expected cost when using the sequential interruption technique described in Section 2 or the probability that the owner will have the required information ) using one of
