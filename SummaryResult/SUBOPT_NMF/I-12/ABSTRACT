The paper describes a mechanism that enables the agent to  significantly improve its estimation by augmenting its direct observations with those obtained by other agents with which it is coordinating.
To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents" observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself.
The coordination autonomy  module of a coordination-manager system provided an empirical setting for evaluation.
Simulation-based evaluations demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms estimations based exclusively on
