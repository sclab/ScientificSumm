At each time step each one of the agents accumulated one additional observation.
As expected, the average-all mechanism performs best when all agents are of the same type; however its performance deteriorates as the number of types increases.
For each number of types, we ran 10000 simulations.
We models the growth of the probability the user has the required information as a function of the amount of  communication using the logistic function,5 G(x) = 1 + e −x 12 1 + 60e −x 12 .
This behavior guarantees that even in scenarios in which users are completely different , the method exhibits a
