Furthermore, in the environments we consider, agents are usually accumulating data at a relatively similar rate.
Nonetheless, the extent to which the observations of other agents will be useful to a given agent depends on the extent to which their users" characteristics" distributions are correlated with that of this agent"s user.
We consider this problem in the context of a multi-agent  distributed system in which computer agents support people who are carrying out complex tasks in a dynamic environment.
In particular , we focus on the related problems of estimating the cost of interrupting a person
