Selective-sharing allows an agent to benefit from other agents" observations in scenarios in which data sources of the same type are available.
The results of our simulations demonstrate the selective-sharing mechanism"s effectiveness in improving the estimation produced for probabilistic parameters based on a limited set of observations.
It also guarantees, as a fallback, performance equivalent to that of a self-learner when the information source is unique.
Although we tested the selective-sharing mechanism in the context of the Coordinators project, it is  applicable in any MAS environment having the characteristics of a fast-paced environment (e.g., rescue environments).
Furthermore
