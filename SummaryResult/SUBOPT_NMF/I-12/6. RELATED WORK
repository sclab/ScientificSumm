The most relevant method for our purposes is the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy index that is used in probability theory and  information theory [12].
However the  applicability of these to fast-paced domains is quite limited because they rely on a large set of existing data.
Given space considerations, our review of this area is  restricted to some representative approaches for clustering.
This measure, which can also be applied on continuous random variables, relies on a natural distance measure from a true probability distribution (either observation-based or calculated) to an arbitrary probability distribution.
Many clustering techniques have been used in data mining
