A key feature of the solution was the specification of multiple configurable criteria to control the propagation of metrics through the system, thereby reducing collection overhead.
One such approach could be based on maintaining metrics history in order to determine the temporal behaviour of metrics and thus make more intelligent and conservative decisions regarding whether a change in a particular metric is likely to be of interest to the adaptation engine and should thus serve as a basis for notification for inclusion in the next metrics push.
Future work will also involve the evaluation of a broad range of adaptation
