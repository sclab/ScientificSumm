Local adaptation is performed by an engine running on the local host (for example in MobJeX this would occur within the service) and thus in this case the delivery phase would be a local inter-process call.
Conversely, global adaptation is handled by a centralised adaptation engine running on a remote host and thus the delivery of metrics is via a remote call, and in the case where multiple runtimes exist without a separate host manager the delivery process would be even more expensive.
Regarding propagation , in brief , it is proposed that when a lower level system component detects
