In addition, to demonstrate the effect of using simple frequency based criteria, the MMCO results as a percentage of method execution time were plotted as a 3-dimensional graph in Figure 3 with the z-axis representing the frequency used in both the measure metrics criterion and the service to adaptation engine push criterion.
Figure 2 shows the metric collection overhead in the mobject (MMCO), for different numbers of mobjects and methods when all criteria are set to always to provide the maximum measurement and propagation of metrics and thus an absolute worst case performance scenario.
Furthermore , the value of n=5
