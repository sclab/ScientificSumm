With the exception of MobJeX [6], existing mobile object systems such as Voyager [10], FarGo [11, 12], and JavaParty [13] do not provide automated adaptation, and therefore lack the metrics collection process required to support this process.
Furthermore, the type of metrics required for performing adaptation is dependent upon the type of adaptation required.
Consequently, the main contribution of this paper is a solution for dynamic metrics collection to support adaptation via object mobility for mobile applications.
On the other hand , adaptation via object mobility [ 6 ] , also requires detailed software metrics [ 9 ] since object
