The last step of the document retrieval sub-problem is results merging, which is the process of transforming database-specific 33 document scores into comparable database-independent document scores.
First, the DTF is a framework designed specifically for document retrieval, but our new model integrates two distinct applications with different requirements (database recommendation and distributed document retrieval) into the same unified framework.
However, two points distinguish our research from the DTF model.
As prior research on different datasets has shown the CORI algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [ 1,17,18 ] , we use it as a
