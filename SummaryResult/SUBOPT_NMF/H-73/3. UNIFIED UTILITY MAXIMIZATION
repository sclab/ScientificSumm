The goal is to select a small set of resources (e.g., less than Nsdb databases) that contain as many relevant documents as possible, which can be formally defined as: = = i N j iji idb ddIdU ^ 1 ^ * )(R)(),( θ (9) I(di) is the indicator function, which is 1 when the ith database is selected and 0 otherwise.
3.4 Resource Selection for High-Precision High-Precision is the goal of resource selection algorithm in federated search tasks such as distributed document retrieval.
