Output: Optimal selection solution for Equation 16. i) Create the three-dimensional array: Sel (1..|DB|, 1..NTotal_rdoc/10, 1..Nsdb) Each Sel (x, y, z) is associated with a selection decision xyzd , which represents the best selection decision in the condition: only databases from number 1 to number x are considered for selection; totally y*10 documents will be retrieved; only z databases are selected out of the x database candidates.
Input: Complete lists of probabilities of relevance for all the |DB| databases.
iii ) Iterate the current database candidate i from 2 to |DB| For each entry Sel ( i , y , z
