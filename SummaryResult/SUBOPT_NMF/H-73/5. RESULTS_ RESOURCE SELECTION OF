The UUM/HR algorithm is more effective than the ReDDE algorithm on the representative and relevant testbeds and is about the same as the ReDDE algorithm on the  Trec123100Col and the nonrelevant testbeds.
It can be noted that when selecting only a few databases on the Trec123-100Col or the nonrelevant testbeds, the ReDEE algorithm has a small advantage over the UUM/HR algorithm.
Collection Selected.
The UUM/HR algorithm is described in Section 3.3.
Resource selection algorithms of database recommendation systems are typically compared using the recall metric nR [1,17,18,21].
It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ReDDE and UUM/HR algorithms
