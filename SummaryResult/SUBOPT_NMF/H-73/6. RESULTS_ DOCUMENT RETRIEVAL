The above experiments suggest that it is very important to optimize the high-precision goal explicitly in document retrieval.
As the unified utility maximization model only utilizes retrieval scores of sampled documents with a centralized retrieval algorithm to calculate the probabilities of relevance, it makes database selection decisions without referring to the document scores from individual databases and can be easily generalized to this case of rank lists without document scores.
