107 In our algorithm, the benefit that entity i has received (indirectly) from entity j is the maxflow from j to i. Conversely, the benefit that entity i has provided indirectly to j is the maxflow from i to j.
This is because no service has been received from any of the colluders.
A maxflow is the greatest level of reputation the source can give to the sink without violating  reputation capacity constraints.
4: end if {Get the flow and number of iterations used from the maxflow alg.}
The maxflow between the source and the target in the graph is
