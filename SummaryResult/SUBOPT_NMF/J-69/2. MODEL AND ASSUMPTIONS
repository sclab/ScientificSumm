The client and server receive the payoff from a generalized payoff matrix (Figure 2).
Unfortunately, existing work either uses a specific asymmetric payoff matrix or only gives the general form for a symmetric one [4].
Rc, Sc, Tc, and Pc are the client"s payoff and Rs, Ss, Ts, and Ps are the server"s payoff.
Defection dominates cooperation ( at least weakly ) at the individual level for the entity who decides whether to cooperate or defect : ( Ts ≥ Rs and Ps ≥ Ss and ( Ts > Rs or Ps > Ss ) )
