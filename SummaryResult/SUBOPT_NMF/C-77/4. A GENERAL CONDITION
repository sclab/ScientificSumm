Rule R3 shows that a process Pj does not systematically update each entry V Cj[k] each time it receives a message m from a process Pi: there is no update of V Cj[k] when V Cj[k] ≥ m.V C[k].
These observations lead to the definition of the condition K(m, k) that characterizes which entries of vectors V Ci and IPi can be omitted from the control information attached to a message m sent by a process Pi to a process Pj: Definition 5.
K ( m , k ) ≡ ( send ( m )
