So, if pred(e) is a relevant event, all the relevant events belonging to its relevant causal past are separated from e by pred(e), and pred(e) becomes the only immediate predecessor of e. In other words, the event pred(e) constitutes a reset w.r.t.
, n} ⊂↑ (e).
If e is not a receive event , IP ( e ) is equal to : ∅ if pred ( e ) = ⊥ , { pred ( e ) } if pred ( e ) ∈ R , IP ( pred ( e ) ) if pred ( e )
