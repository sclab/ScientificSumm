As soon as ∃k : V Cj[k] = 0, both IPT2 and IPT3 behave as IPT1 (the shape of the curve becomes flat) since the condition K(m, k) is no longer satisfied.
Finally, the last parameter of the simulator is the number of send events that occurred during a simulation.
Furthermore, IPT3 benefits from transmitting additional boolean vectors to save triple transmissions.
Figure 3.b displays an interesting feature.
The parameter λ of the Poisson time distribution ( λ is the average number of relevant events in a given time interval ) has been set so that the relevant events are
