In that sense, this family defines message size-efficient IPT protocols.
Interestingly, it has also been shown that the efficiency of the protocols (measured in terms of the size of the control information that is not piggybacked by an application  message) depends on the pattern defined by the communication events and the relevant events.
According to the way the general condition is implemented,  different IPT protocols can be obtained.
Last but not least , it is interesting to note that if one is not interested in tracking the immediate predecessor events , the protocols presented in the paper can be simplified
