Note that, if e ∈ R then ↑ (e) = {f ∈ R | f → e}.
The following properties are immediate consequences of the previous definitions.
Let e ∈ H. CP1 If e is not a receive event then ↑ ( e ) = 8 < : ∅ if pred ( e ) = ⊥ , ↑ ( pred ( e ) ) ∪ { pred ( e ) } if pred ( e ) ∈ R , ↑ ( pred ( e ) ) if pred ( e ) ∈ R. CP2 If e is a receive event ( of
