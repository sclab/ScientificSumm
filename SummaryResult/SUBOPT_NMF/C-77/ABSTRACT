The family is defined by a general condition that allows application  messages to piggyback control information whose size can be smaller than n (the number of processes).
This paper addresses the IPT problem: it presents a family of  protocols that provides each relevant event with a timestamp that exactly identifies its immediate predecessors.
In that sense, this family defines message size-efficient IPT protocols.
So, IPT is the on-the-fly computation of the transitive reduction (i.e., Hasse diagram) of the causality relation defined by a distributed computation.
According to the way the general condition is implemented , different IPT protocols can be
