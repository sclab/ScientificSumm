This problem has been addressed for the first time (to our knowledge) in [4, 6] where an IPT protocol is described, but without correctness proof.
Moreover, in this protocol, timestamps attached to messages are of size n. This raises the following question which, to our  knowledge, has never been answered: Are there efficient vector clock implementation techniques that are suitable for the IPT problem?.
When the immediate predecessors are used to monitor the computation, it has to be done on the fly.
In this paper , we are interested in the restriction of the causality relation to the subset of
