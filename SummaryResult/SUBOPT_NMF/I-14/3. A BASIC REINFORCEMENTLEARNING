( 2 ) For each agent Aik in the PDn ( Ai , QSj ) , the probability of forwarding the query to Aik is determined in the following way in order to assign higher forwarding probability to the neighboring agents with higher expected utility value : πn+1 i ( QSj , αik ) = dn+1 i |PDn ( Ai , QSj ) | + β ∗ ` Uik ( QSj ) − PDU ( Ai , QSj ) |PDn ( Ai , QSj ) | ´ ( 3 ) where PDUn ( Ai , QSj ) = X o∈P
