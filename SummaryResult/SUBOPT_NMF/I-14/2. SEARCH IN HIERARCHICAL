For the first query in MFi, agent Ai determines which subset of its neighboring agents to forward it to based on the agent"s routing policy πi.
MFi  consists of a set of queries to forward on and is processed in a FIFO (first in first out) fashion.
In the first step, upon receipt of a query qk at time tl from a user, agent Ai  initiates a search session si by probing its neighboring agents Aj ∈ NEI(Ai) with the message PROBE for the similarity value Sim(qk, Aj) between qk and Aj.
These routing decisions determine
