Once the topology is built, queries randomly selected from the query set 301−350 on TREC-VLC-921 and query set 1− 50 on TREC-123-100-Random and TREC-123-100-Source are injected to the system based on a Poisson distribution P(N(t) = n) = (λt)n n!
During the topology generation process, degree information of each agent is estimated by the algorithm introduced by Palmer et al.
The average reward for SSLA approach starts at the same level with the SSNA algorithm.
The service time for the communication queue and local search queue , i.e tQij and trs , is set as 0.01 time unit and
