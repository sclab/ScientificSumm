Each agent maintains estimations, probabilistically or  deterministically, on the distance to a certain destination through its neighbors.
It has been discovered that the locality property is an  important feature of information retrieval systems in user  modeling studies[3].
IP-level Routing problems have been attacked from the reinforcement learning  perspective[2, 5, 11, 12].
A variant of Q-Learning techniques is deployed The Sixth Intl.

While this line of studies carry a certain similarity with our work, it has mainly focused on packet-switched communication networks.
In this domain, the destination of a packet is deterministic and unique.
