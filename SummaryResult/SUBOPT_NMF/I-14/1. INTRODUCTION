The goal of the learning algorithm, even though it consumes some network bandwidth, is to shorten the routing time so that more queries are processed per time unit while at the same time finding more relevant documents.
Based on the  updated expected utility information, the agents derive  corresponding routing policies.
Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (1) a reinforcement learning based approach for agents to acquire satisfactory routing policies based on estimates of the potential contribution of their neighboring agents; (2) two strategies to speed up the learning process.
In the absence of global information , the dominant strategies
