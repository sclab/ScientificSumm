Based on this information, the agents derive corresponding routing policies.
Thereafter, these agents route the queries based on the learned policies and update the estimates based on the new routing policies.

In this paper, an online reinforcement-learning based approach is developed to take advantage of the  dynamic run-time characteristics of P2P IR systems as  represented by information about past search sessions.
Experimental results demonstrate that the learning algorithm improves considerably the routing performance on two test collection sets that have been used in a variety
