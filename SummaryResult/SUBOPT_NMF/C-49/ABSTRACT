Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to address the problem, but few were evaluated in a realistic opportunistic  network setting.
We use simulation and contact traces (derived from logs in a production network) to evaluate and compare five  existing protocols: direct-delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, and Link-State, as well as our own proposed routing protocol.
We show that the direct delivery and epidemic routing protocols suffer either low delivery ratio or high resource usage, and other protocols make tradeoffs between delivery ratio and resource usage.
