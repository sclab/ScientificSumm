In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people.
We assume that people send messages to other people occasionally, using their  devices; when no direct link exists between the source and the  destination of the message, other nodes may relay the message to the destination.
Few of them were evaluated in realistic network settings, or even in realistic simulations, due to the lack of any realistic people  mobility model.
Realising the limitations of using random mobility models in simulations , a few researchers have studied routing protocols in mobile opportunistic networks with realistic
