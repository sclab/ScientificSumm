The three prediction-based approaches had low delivery ratio, compared to epidemic routing.
Although we had 5,142 users in the  network, the direct-delivery and random protocols had low delivery ratios (note the log scale).
The number of message transmissions of  epidemic routing was more than 10 times higher than for the  predictionbased routing protocols.
Figure 4 shows that epidemic and all prediction-based methods had substantial meta-data transmissions, though epidemic routing had relatively more, with shorter TTLs.
4.5 Results Here we compare simulation results of the six routing protocols.
The replication factor r was not limited by default , so the source
