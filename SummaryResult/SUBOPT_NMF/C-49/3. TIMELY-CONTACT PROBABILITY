Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within Î”T is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receiver"s storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the  communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages.
If the destination of a  message is the receiver itself, the message is delivered.
After receiving a meta-message , a node checks whether it has any message that destined to its neighbor , or to a node in the
