In some applications, context information (such as location) may be available for the peers.
The prediction-based  routing protocols had a delivery ratio more than 10 times better than that for direct-delivery and random routing, and fewer  transmissions and less storage usage than epidemic routing.
because they either had an extremely low delivery ratio, or had an extremely high resource consumption.
Epidemic routing delivered the most messages.
Indeed , there is an opportunity for some adaptation ; for example , high priority messages may be given higher transfer and replication probabilities to increase the chance of delivery and reduce the delay
