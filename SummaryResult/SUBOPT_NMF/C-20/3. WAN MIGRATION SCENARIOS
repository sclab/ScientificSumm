When data is being replicated  synchronously, there will be a performance impact on the application.
Note that while we have described the live server migration  process as involving the service provider for the networking part, it is possible for a data center provider to perform a similar set of functions without involving the service provider.
At the one extreme, one might incur the overhead of completely mirroring the application at the remote site.
Thus , between the server migration and synchronous replication , both the application state and all the storage operations are mirrored at the two environments in the
