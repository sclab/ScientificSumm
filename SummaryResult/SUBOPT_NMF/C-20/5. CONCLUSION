We advocated using server virtualization technologies to  enable the replication and migration of server functions.
In this paper we advocated a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across WANs to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner.
We sought to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and incidental outages of data center  facilities.
We proposed new network functions to enable server migration and replication across wide area networks ( such as the Internet or a geographically distributed virtual private network ) , and finally showed the utility of intelligent and dynamic storage
