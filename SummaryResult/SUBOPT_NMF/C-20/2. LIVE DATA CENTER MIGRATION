Assuming that  network level reachability to the virtual server"s network addresses are maintained after the migration, the implication is that applications executing in the virtual server experience very little downtime (in the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and ongoing network connections remain intact.
Since the virtual server is migrated in its entirety, both  application and kernel level state gets migrated, including any state associated with ongoing network connections.
Remote replication can be broadly classified into the following two categories : ยก Synchronous replication : every data block written to a local storage system is replicated to
