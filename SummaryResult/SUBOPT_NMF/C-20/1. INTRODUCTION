Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.
In particular, since the virtual server retains the same network address as before, any ongoing network level  interactions are not disrupted.
In this paper we outline a design for live service migration across WANs.
In the LAN environment, these  technologies have proven to be a very effective tool to enable data center management in a non-disruptive fashion.
When using these technologies in a LAN environment , services execute in a virtual server , and the migration services
