Given this algorithm, we can see that the most critical decision that a crawler has to make is what query to issue next.
In the next section, we formalize this query selection problem.

Every potential query qi that we may issue can be viewed as a subset of S, containing all the points (pages) that are returned when we issue qi to the site.
In Figure 4 we show the generic algorithm for a Hidden-Web crawler.
Our algorithm leverages the observation that although we
