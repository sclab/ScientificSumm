First, it provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the process of generating queries for a database and examining the results, which can help us better understand the  effectiveness of the methods presented in the previous work.
Again, these works study orthogonal issues and are complementary to our work.
These approaches  essentially assume cooperative document databases that willingly share some of their metadata and/or documents to help a third-party search engine to index the documents.
For example, in [10, 11], Callan and Connel try to acquire an  accurate language model by collecting a uniform random sample from the database.
