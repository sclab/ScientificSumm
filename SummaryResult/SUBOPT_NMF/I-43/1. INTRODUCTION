We show that the recently developed Extended Markov  Tracking (EMT) approach [13, 14, 15] is subsumed by DBC, with EMT employing greedy action selection, which is a specific  parameterization among the options possible within DBC.
In this paper, we present the structure of Dynamics Based  Control.
Section 3 introduces the Dynamics Based Control (DBC) structure, and its specialization to Markovian environments.
We do not use a (state-based) reward function, but instead optimize over a different criterion, a transition-based specification of the desired system dynamics.
EMT is an efficient instantiation of DBC.
Here , optimality is measured in terms of probability
