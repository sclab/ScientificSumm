Avoidance is thus unnatural in native EMT-based control.
Both already have partial  solutions and are subjects of ongoing research.
This requires replacement of standard EMT-based action selection by the algorithm below [15]: • Given: - a set of target dynamics {qk}K k=1, - vector of weights w(k) • Select action as follows - For each action a ∈ A predict the future state  distribution ¯pa t+1 = Ta ∗ pt; - For each action, compute Da = H(¯pa t+1, pt, PDt) - For each a ∈ A and qk tactical target, denote V (a, k) = DKL (Da qk) pt .
If these preference vectors are
