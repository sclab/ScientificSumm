The results of these experiments are shown in Table 2.
As the agent actively seeks the quarry, the entropy never reaches its maximum.
For the  irregular open arena domain, which proved to be the most difficult, 1000 experiment runs bounded by 100 steps each, a total of 42411 steps, were completed in slightly under 6 hours.
We also used two variations of the environment observability function.
For the Game of Tag, we can easily formulate three major trends: catching the quarry, staying mobile, and stalking the quarry.
With probability q0 1 it stays put , and with probability 1 âˆ’
