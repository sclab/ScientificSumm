We exploit this efficiency in a set of experiments that applied  multitarget EMT to a class of area-sweeping problems (searching for moving targets).
EMT employs greedy action selection to  provide an efficient control algorithm in Markovian environments.
We show that such problems can be naturally  defined and efficiently solved using the DBC framework, and its EMT instantiation.
We show that a recently developed planning and control approach, Extended Markov Tracking (EMT) is an  instantiation of DBC.
Unlike existing approaches , which seek to optimize expected rewards ( e.g. , in Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems ( POMDPs ) ) ,
