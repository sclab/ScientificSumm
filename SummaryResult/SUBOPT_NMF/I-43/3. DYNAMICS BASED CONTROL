on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 791 - A is the set of all possible actions applicable in the  environment; - T is the environment"s probabilistic transition function: T : S ×A → Π(S).
This is what the sensor input would look like for an outside observer; - Ω is the observation probability function: Ω : S × A × S → Π(O).
Data would also be available about the system response to different actions performed ; combined with a dynamics estimator defined by the User Level , this can provide an important tool for the environment model calibration
