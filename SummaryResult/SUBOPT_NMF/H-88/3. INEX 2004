3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by  various quantization functions to give different weights to  different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.
Additional information on the assessment methodology may be found in Piwowarski and Lalmas [19], who provide a detailed rationale.
Both the generalized quantization function and the specificity-oriented generalization (sog) function credit elements according to their degree of relevance [11], with the second function  placing greater emphasis on specificity.
3.2 Relevance Assessment Since XML IR is concerned with locating those elements that provide
