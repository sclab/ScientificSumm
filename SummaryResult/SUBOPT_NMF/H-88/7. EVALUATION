Recalling that the XCG metric is designed to penalize overlap, while the inex-2002 metric ignores overlap, the conflict between the metrics is obvious.
The INEX evaluation packages (inex_eval and inex_eval_ng) were used to  compute values for the inex-2002 and inex-2003 metrics.
The MAP values at one extreme (α = 0.0) and the XCG value at the other extreme (α = 1.0) represent retrieval performance comparable to the best systems at INEX 2004 [8,12].
Values for the XCG metrics were computed using software supplied by its inventors [11].
