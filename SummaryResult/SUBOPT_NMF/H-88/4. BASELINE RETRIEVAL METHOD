Prior to INEX 2004, we trained the MultiText system using the INEX 2003 queries.
The results were surprising.
[10], the retrieval  results are filtered to eliminate very short elements, those less than 25 words in length.
After tuning over a wide range of  values under several quantization functions, we selected values of k = 10.0 and b = 0.80 for our INEX 2004 experiments, and these values are used for the experiments reported in section 7.
[21] by setting parameters k2 = 0 and k3 = âˆž.
In our experience , the performance of BM25 typically benefits from tuning the b and k1 parameters
