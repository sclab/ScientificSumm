We  apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can be used in practical systems in which different learners may be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning  algorithms.
This allows us to apply existing agent  interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks, thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions.
This paper proposes a framework for agent-based distributed machine learning and data mining based on ( i ) the exchange of meta-level descriptions of individual learning processes among agents
