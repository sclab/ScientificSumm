In this paper, we outlined a generic, abstract framework for distributed machine learning and data mining.
Yet there is a number of issues that we have not addressed in the presentation of the architecture and its empirical  evaluation: Firstly, we have not considered the cost of  communication and made the implicit assumption that the required communication comes for free.
This framework constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt 684 The Sixth Intl.
This is of course  inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of  learning results.
