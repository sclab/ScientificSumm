These two sets assess the agent"s ability to detect suspicious vessels.
For each hypothesis h = c1, .
For this, we assign a confidence value r(h, d) to every ship d: r(h, d) = 1 |d âˆ’ cC(h,d)| where C(h, d) is the index of the nearest centroid.
with real-valued domains ([Ai] = R for all i).
We assume that agents are sincere when advertising their model quality , but note that this quality might be of limited relevance to other agents as they may specialise on specific regions of the data space not related to the
