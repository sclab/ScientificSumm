Many  distributed learning domains involve the use of sensitive data and prohibit the exchange of this data (e.g.
exchange of  patient data in distributed brain tumour diagnosis [2]) -  however, they may permit the exchange of local learning  hypotheses among different learners.
Despite the autonomy and self-directedness of learning agents , many of these systems exhibit a sufficient overlap in terms of individual learning goals so that beneficial cooperation might be possible if a model for flexible interaction between autonomous learners was available that allowed agents to 1. exchange information about different aspects of their own learning mechanism at different levels
