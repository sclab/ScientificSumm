The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent  learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.
[13] which is also specifically designed for a  particular learning algorithm.
A similar example is the work of Weiss [24], where groups of  classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.
Agents were able to critique each others" hypotheses until agreement was reached.
A number of approaches for sharing learning data [ 18 ] have also been proposed : Grecu and Becker [ 12 ] suggest an exchange of learning samples
