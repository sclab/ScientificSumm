Investigating the strategic power of jobs in such mechanisms is another line of future research. 
We also plan to look at cost sharing mechanisms other than the Shapley value.
Some initial simplifications already appear in [16], where we provide an alternative axiom to ECB and also discuss the implication of transfers between jobs (in stead of transfers from jobs to a central server).
In future, we plan to further simplify some of the fairness axioms.
We characterized the Shapley value rule using different intuitive fairness axioms.
We took a cooperative game theory approach and show that the famous the Shapley
