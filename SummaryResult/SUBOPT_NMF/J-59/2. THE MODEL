For any S ⊆ N, let σ∗ be an efficient ordering of jobs in S. For every i = j, i, j ∈ S, if σ∗ i > σ∗ j , then γi ≤ γj.
The costs to jobs in S \ {i, j} is not changed from σ∗ to σ.
Lemma 1.
233 An allocation (σ, t) is efficient for q = (N, p, θ) whenever σ is an efficient ordering and £i∈N ti = 0.
To achieve notational simplicity, we will write the total cost in an efficient ordering of jobs from N as C(N)  whenever it is not confusing.
If σ∗ =
