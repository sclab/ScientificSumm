For adjusted  noenvy, if (σ, t) is an allocation for some q ∈ Q, let tij be the 237 transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with respect to ordering σij .
To overcome this, Chun [2] introduces the notion of adjusted no-envy, which he shows is satisfied in the Shapley value rule when processing times of all jobs are unity.
Proposition 6.
Consider a q ∈ Q in which pi = pj and θi = θj.
Definition 11.
An allocation rule ψ is reasonable if for all q ∈ Q and ( σ , t ) ∈ ψ
