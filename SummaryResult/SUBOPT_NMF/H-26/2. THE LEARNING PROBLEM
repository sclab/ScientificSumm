We assume true rankings have two rank values, where relevant documents have rank value 1 and non-relevant  documents rank value 0.
2.1 MAP vs ROCArea Most learning algorithms optimize for accuracy or  ROCArea.
These two hypotheses predict a ranking for query x over a corpus of eight documents.
In the case of learning a ranked retrieval function, X  denotes a space of queries, and Y the space of (possibly weak) rankings over some corpus of documents C = {d1, .
