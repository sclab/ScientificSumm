The difference in the value of H for these two rankings is exactly δj(i, i + 1).
, d¯x j , dx i , dx i+1, .
, o|C¯x| encode the positions of the non-relevant documents, where dx oj is the highest ranked relevant  document ranked after the jth non-relevant document.
Conceptually H starts with a perfect ranking ¯y, and adds the change in H when each successive non-relevant document slides up the ranking.
Conceptually, Algorithm 2 starts with a perfect ranking.
We define δj ( i1 , i2 ) , with i1 < i2 , as the change in H from when the highest
