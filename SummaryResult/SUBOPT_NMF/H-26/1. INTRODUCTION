Learning a model to optimize for such measures might result in suboptimal MAP performance.
In this paper, we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that maximize MAP performance.
However, achieving high MAP only requires finding a good ordering of the documents.
The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea.
Performance measures  optimized include accuracy [17, 15], ROCArea [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 21] or modifications of ROCArea [4], and NDCG [2, 3].
Specifically , we present an SVM algorithm that globally optimizes
