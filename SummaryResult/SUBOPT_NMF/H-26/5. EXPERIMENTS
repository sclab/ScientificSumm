All tables displaying our experimental results are structured identically.

The performance of most models degraded by a small amount, with SVM∆ map still having the best performance.
Given that many of these submissions use scoring functions which are carefully crafted to achieve high MAP , it is possible that the best performing submissions use techniques which subsume the techniques of the other
