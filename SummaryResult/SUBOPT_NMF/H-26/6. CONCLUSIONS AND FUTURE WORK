The computational cost for training is very reasonable in practice.
Our new method makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for Accuracy and ROCArea.
We have presented an SVM method that directly  optimizes MAP.
It provides a principled approach and avoids difficult to control heuristics.
We have shown  empirically that our method is generally superior to or  competitive with conventional SVMs methods.
Since other methods typically require tuning multiple heuristics, we also expect to train fewer models before finding one which achieves good performance.
We formulated the optimization problem and presented
