9 For the semantics of CTL+, and discussion of model checking complexity, cf.
Otherwise, remove from M all the states that do not satisfy p (yielding a sparser model M ), and check the CTL formula Eγ in M , q with any CTL model-checker.
That is, the  complexity is no worse than for CTLK itself. 
First, subformulae are evaluated recursively: for every subformula ψ of ϕ, the set of states in M that satisfy ψ is computed and labeled with a new proposition pψ.

Model checking CTLKP against CTLK models is PTIME-complete , and can
