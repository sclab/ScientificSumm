Firstly, we briefly present branching-time logic with knowledge, CTLK.
The latter approach is based on the more powerful logic ATL [1].
The main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen.
We believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility and practical beliefs quite often in their everyday  reasoning.
In Section 3 we present our approach to plausibility and  formally define CTLK with plausibility.
The paper is structured as follows.
We propose a particular notion of beliefs ( inspired by [ 20 , 7 ] ) ,
