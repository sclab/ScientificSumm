Proposition 11.
Or, if he knows a fact, he also believes that he knows it.
The following formulae are strongly valid: (i) Baϕ → KaBaϕ, (ii) KaBaϕ → Baϕ, (iii) Kaϕ → BaKaϕ.
Let ϕ be a CTLKP formula, and M be a CTLKP model.
Moreover, as one may expect, beliefs do not have to be always true.

Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all
