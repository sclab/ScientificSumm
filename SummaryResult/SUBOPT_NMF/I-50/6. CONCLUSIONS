Human agents use a similar concept of plausibility and practical beliefs in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search space and make the reasoning feasible.
We also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility  update operator (in a way similar to [13]).
We also prove that believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all  plausibly possible situations.
Furthermore, we propose a non-standard  notion of beliefs, defined in terms of indistinguishability and plausibility.
We would like to stress that we do not see this contribution as a mere technical
