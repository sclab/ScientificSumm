The semantics of CTLK is based on Kripke models M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π , which include a nonempty set of states Q, a state transition relation R ⊆ Q × Q, epistemic  indistinguishability relations ∼a⊆ Q × Q (one per agent), and a valuation of propositions π : Π → P(Q).
The language of CTLK consists of formulae ϕ, given as follows: ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | Eγ | Kaϕ γ ::= fϕ | 2 ϕ | ϕU ϕ.
It will not always be so when plausible paths are introduced.
We assume that relation R is serial and that
