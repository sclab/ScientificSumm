We then characterise the computational complexity of a number of decision problems associated with these Kripke-based normative system games; for example, we show that the  complexity of checking whether there exists a normative system which has the property of being a Nash implementation is NP-complete.

Using this scheme , we define a model of ordinal utility , which in turn allows us to interpret our Kripke-based normative systems as games , in which agents must determine whether to comply with the
