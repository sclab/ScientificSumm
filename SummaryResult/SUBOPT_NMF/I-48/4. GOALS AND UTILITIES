We assume that the x values in pairs (ϕ, x) ∈ γ are specified so that x for agent i means the same as x for agent j , and so we have cardinal utility.
The results of this paper in fact hold irrespective of which of these representations we actually choose; we fix upon the goal hierarchy approach in the interests of simplicity.
Note that this is an ordinal utility measure: it tells us, for any given agent, the relative utility of different Kripke structures, but utility values are not on some standard system-wide scale.
Notice that since for any
