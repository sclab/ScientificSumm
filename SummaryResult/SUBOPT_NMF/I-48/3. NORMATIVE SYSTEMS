Let N (R) = {η : (η ⊆ R) & (R \ η is total)} be the set of normative systems over R. The intended  interpretation of a normative system η is that (s, s ) ∈ η means transition (s, s ) is forbidden in the context of η; hence R \ η denotes the legal transitions of η.
Formally , if K = S , S0 , R , A , α , V , and η ∈ N ( R ) , then let K†η = K be the Kripke structure K = S , S0 , R , A , α , V
