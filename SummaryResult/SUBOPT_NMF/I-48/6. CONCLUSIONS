Game theory is a very natural tool to analyse and answer these questions, which involve strategic considerations, and we have  proposed a way to translate key questions concerning logic-based  normative systems to game theoretical questions.
Of course, our approach is in many senses open for extension or enrichment.
We have proposed a logical framework to reason about such scenarios, and we have given some computational costs for settling some of the main  questions about them.
And, for a system designer, how to be sure that the system will behave socially, that is, according to its norm.
An obvious issue is
