Next, consider the following  formulae: k^ i=1 E f(t(xi ) ∨ f (xi )) (1) k^ i=1 ¬((E ft(xi )) ∧ (E ff (xi ))) (2) We then define the goal hierarchy for all agent 1 as follows: γ1[0] = γ1[1] = (1) ∧ (2) ∧ ϕ∗ We claim there is an individually rational normative system for the instance so constructed iff ϕ is satisfiable.
( Our choice of terminology is deliberately chosen to reflect the way the term Nash implementation is used in implementation theory , or mechanism design [ 11 , p.185 ] , where a game designer
