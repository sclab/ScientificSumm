A path π such that π[0] = s is an s-path.
We have two states , s and t , and two corresponding Boolean variables p1 and p2 , which are 1 In the branching time temporal logic literature , a relation R ⊆ S × S is said to be total iff ∀s ∃s : ( s , s ) ∈ R. Note that the term total relation is sometimes used to refer to relations R ⊆ S × S such that for every pair of elements s , s ∈ S we have either ( s , s
