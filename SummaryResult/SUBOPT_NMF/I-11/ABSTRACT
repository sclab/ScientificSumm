In addition, we often want to predict the agent"s future actions, which are constrained not only by these inward characteristics, but also by the dynamics of the agent"s interaction with its environment.
Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning - parameter learning.
BEE (Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation) uses a faster-than-real-time  agentbased model of the environment to characterize agents" internal state by evolution against observed behavior, and then predict their future behavior, taking into account the dynamics of their interaction with the environment.
I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial  Intelligence- multiagent systems.
To understand these actions ,
