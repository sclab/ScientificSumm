In our experiments, we apply BEE to a simulated battle, and domain time is the time stamp published by the simulator.
It diffuses pheromones to nearby places, disseminating information for access by nearby agents.
If BEE is applied to a real-world situation, this time is the same as real-world time.
The distribution of each pheromone flavor over the  environment forms a field that represents some aspect of the state of the world at an instant in time.
BEE time for a page records the domain time corresponding to the state of the world represented on that page , and is
