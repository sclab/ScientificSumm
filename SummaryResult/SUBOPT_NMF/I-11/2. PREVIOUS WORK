In both cases, the agent has hidden internal state (the agent"s personality) and observable state (its outward  behavior), and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state (by evolution in BEE, by the Baum-Welch algorithm [1] in HMM"s) and then predict the agent"s future behavior (by  extrapolation via ghosts in BEE, by the forward algorithm in HMM"s).
The agent"s emotional state can  modulate its decision process and its focus of attention (and thus its perception of the environment).
2.2 Hidden Markov Models BEE is superficially similar to
