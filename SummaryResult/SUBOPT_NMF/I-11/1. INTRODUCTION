It is inspired by  techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical  systems, in which a representation of the system is continually fit to its recent past behavior.
Environmental dynamics can frustrate agent intentions.
Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be  characterized as adversarial, and include military combat, competitive business tactics, and multi-player computer games.
A central challenge in many application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state.
In BEE, it is a set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents  representing the individuals being analyzed.
