In this paper, we present a formal model for a semantic alignment procedure that incrementally aligns differing conceptualisations of two or more agents relative to their respective perception of the environment or domain they are acting in.
It hence makes the situation in which the alignment occurs explicit in the model.
We resort to Channel Theory to carry out the formalisation.
