For each task, a quality accumulation function qaf is  defined, which specifies when and how a task accumulates  quality as its subtasks (methods) are executed.
Method durations and quality are typically specified as discrete probability distributions, and hence known with certainty only after they have been  executed.1 It is also possible for a method to fail unexpectedly in execution, in which case the reported quality is zero.
Within C TAEMS, tasks are represented hierarchically, as shown in the  example in Figure 1.
Figure 2 shows the subjective view available to agent 2 for the same problem.
