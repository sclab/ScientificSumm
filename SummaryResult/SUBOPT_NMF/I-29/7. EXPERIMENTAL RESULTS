The  hardware configuration used by the evaluators instantiated and ran one agent per machine, dedicating a separate machine to the MASS simulator.
As reported in Table 1, the year 1 prototype agent clearly compares favorably to the benchmark on all classes,  coming within 2% of the MDP optimal averaged over the  entire set of 2190 problems.
In about half of the TT problems the year 1 agent under-performs on, the specified time windows within which an agent"s  ac490 The Sixth Intl.
