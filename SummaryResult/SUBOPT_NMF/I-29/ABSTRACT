We describe an agent architecture for solving this problem that couples two basic mechanisms: (1) a flexible times representation of the agent"s schedule (using a Simple Temporal Network) and (2) an incremental rescheduling procedure.
The goal is to maximize the joint quality obtained from the activities executed by all agents, given that, during execution,  unexpected events will force changes to some prescribed  activities and reduce the utility of executing others.
Basic  coordination with other agents is achieved simply by  communicating schedule changes to those agents with inter-dependent activities.
