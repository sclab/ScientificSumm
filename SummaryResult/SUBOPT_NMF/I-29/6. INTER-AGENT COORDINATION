Given this state, the maximum quality that Agent2 can contribute to the task group is 10, and the total task group quality would then be 15 + 10 = 25.
For each such local method, the set of remote enablers are hypothetically  activated, and the scheduler attempts to construct a new local schedule under these optimistic assumptions.
Using optimistic synchronization, Agent2 will generate a non-local option that indicates that if M5 becomes enabled, both M5 and M6 would be scheduled, and the quality contributed by Agent2 to the task group would become 30.
The Option Manager currently employs two basic search strategies
