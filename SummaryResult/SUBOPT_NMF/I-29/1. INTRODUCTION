We define an agent architecture centered around  incremental management of a flexible times schedule.
The advantages of  flexible times frameworks have been demonstrated in various centralized planning and scheduling contexts (e.g., [12, 8, 9, 10, 11]).
Basic  coordination with other agents is achieved by simple  communication of local schedule changes to other agents with  interdependent activities.
Finally we conclude with a brief discussion of current research plans. 
We assume a team of collaborative agents, each responsible for executing a portion of a globally  preestablished schedule, but none possessing a global view of either the problem or solution.
However their use
