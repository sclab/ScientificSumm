The flexible times representation afforded by the STN  provides a quick means of assessing whether the next method on the timeline can begin immediate execution instead of  waiting for its previously established earliest start time (est).
If alternatively, other problem constraints prevent this relaxation of the est, then there is forced idle time that may be exploited by revising the schedule, and the scheduler is invoked (always respecting the freeze period).
Consider the case of a method completion message, one of the environmental messages that could be communicated to the scheduler as an execution state update.
