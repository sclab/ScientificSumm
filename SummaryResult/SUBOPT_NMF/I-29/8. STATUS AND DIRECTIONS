To fully address various scale up issues, we are  investigating a number of more advanced coordination mechanisms.
We have recently completed a re-implementation of the prototype agent  designed to address some recognized performance issues.
To provide more global perspective to local scheduling  decisions, we are introducing mechanisms for computing,  communicating and using estimates of the non-local impact of remote nodes.
In addition to verifying that the performance on Year 1  problems is matched or exceeded, we have recently run some successful tests with the agent on a few 100 agent problems.
This scale places much higher computational demands on all
