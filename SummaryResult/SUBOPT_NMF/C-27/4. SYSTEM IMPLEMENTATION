4.2 Spotlight System The second Spotlight system we built used, as the Spotlight device, diode lasers, a computerized telescope mount (Celestron CG-5GT, shown in Figure 11), and an IBM Thinkpad laptop.
We implemented a very simple detection function based on the observed maximum value.
4.4 Localization Function L(T) The Localization Function is implemented in the Java GUI.
