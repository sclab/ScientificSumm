In the Hamming (7, 4) scheme, a message having 4 bits of data (e.g.
Both are perfect linear error correcting codes.
Golay codes can detect up to 6-bit errors and correct up to 3-bit errors.
Considering the noise that is present in a real, outdoor environment, it is easy to observe that a relatively small error in detecting the correct bit pattern could result in a large localization error.
Golay is thus 80 times more robust that the Hamming scheme, which is 20 times more robust than the no error correction scheme.
As shown in Figure 5 , the plane
