To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.
These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.
The Spotlight device uses a steerable laser light source, illuminating the sensor nodes placed within a known terrain.
An on-board GPS [23] is a typical high-end solution, which requires sophisticated hardware to achieve high resolution time synchronization with satellites.
the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.
Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes
