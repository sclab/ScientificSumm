Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.
A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 
The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.
As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.
This error is currently state of art , even for range-based localization systems and it is 75 % smaller
