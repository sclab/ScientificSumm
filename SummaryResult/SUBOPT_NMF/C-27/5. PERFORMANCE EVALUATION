The reason why we did not observe the same dependency in the case of the Point Scan EDF was that we did not experiment with event sizes below 7cm, due to the long time it would have taken to scan the entire field with events as small as 1.7cm.
Thus, it introduced biased errors in the position estimation.
One can remark the average localization duration of about 10sec, much shorter then the duration obtained in the Point Scan experiment.
The experimental results , presented in Figure 22 , emphasize the need for error correction of the bit patterns observed and
