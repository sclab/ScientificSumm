The problem of localization of wireless sensor nodes has long been regarded as very difficult to solve, when considering the realities of real world environments.
A sensor network, with any number of nodes, deployed in a 2500m2 area, can be localized in under 10 minutes, using a device that costs less than $1000.
In this paper, we formally describe, design, implement and evaluate a novel localization system, called Spotlight.
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of a sub-meter localization error , obtained in an outdoor environment , without equipping the wireless sensor nodes with
