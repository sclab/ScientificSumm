propose in [4] a localization scheme, called Centroid, in which each node localizes itself to the centroid of its proximate beacon nodes.
This approach is called range-free and it attempts to obtain location information from the proximity to a set of known beacon nodes.
The Cricket location-support system [25] can achieve a location granularity of tens of centimeters with short range ultrasound transceivers.
[27], employs Time of Arrival (ToA) ranging techniques that require extensive hardware and solving relatively large nonlinear systems of equations.
The Global Coordinate System [ 20 ] , developed at MIT , uses apriori knowledge of the
