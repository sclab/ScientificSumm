We use various degree distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and  incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential attachment in our network models.
Local behaviour takes place on a network substrate across which agents exchange positive and  negative information about products.
Local behaviour incorporates a  satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the  interactions between agents, including learning about the  trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or switching costs.
We compare the effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures for easy and hard
