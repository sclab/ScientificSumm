The  simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work  presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects.
These studies have found that , given a sufficient number of service providers , honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones , and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance
