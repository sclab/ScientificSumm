This suggests a third method for  predicting performance.
Therefore the Cox-Lewis statistic is highly dependent on selecting the top n documents.1 Remember that we have n documents and a set of scores.
In Figure 2b, we depict predictors which compare the original retrieval, y, to a perturbed version of the retrieval, Ëœy.
larity between the retrieval and a perturbed version of that retrieval [18, 19].
Finally, assume that we have, in addition to the retrieval we want to evaluate, m retrievals from a variety of  different systems.
If , on the other hand , the retrieval is very consistent with
