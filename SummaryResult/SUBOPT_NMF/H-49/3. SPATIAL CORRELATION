We would like to compare autocorrelation values for  different retrievals.
One such suitable measure is the Moran coefficient of spatial  autocorrelation.
We present some examples of autocorrelations of functions on a grid in Figure 1.
Recall that we are given the top n documents retrieved in y.
From the perspective of information retrieval, each of these grid spaces would represent a document and  documents would be organized so that they lay next to topically-related documents.
We use Pearson '' s product-moment correlation to measure the similarity between these vectors , ρ ( y , yµ ) = yT yµ y
