We know that diffusion of scores on the web graph and language model graphs improves performance [14, 16].
Recall that we regard autocorrelation as the degree to which a retrieval satisfies the clustering hypothesis.
Once computed, a system rarely compares the score of a to the score of a topically-related document b.
Our experiments, then, demonstrate that a failure to respect the clustering  hypothesis correlates with poor performance.
We should make it clear that we have selected tasks where topical autocorrelation is appropriate.
Query-based  information retrieval systems often score documents  independently.
We believe that autocorrelation is , like multiple-retrieval algorithms
