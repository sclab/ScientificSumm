One common shortcoming of previous techniques is the  assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments.

We also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance prediction for a massive number of retrieval systems over a variety of collections in several languages.
Approaches exist for the case of few and even no relevance judgments.
Our focus is on zero-judgment  performance prediction of individual retrievals.
These new predictors can also be incorporated with classic predictors
