In this paper, we present results for ranking retrievals from arbitrary systems.
We adjust scores to have zero mean and unit variance.
We would like to predict the performance of this retrieval with respect to some evaluation measure (eg, mean average precision).
We place these scores in the length n vector, y, where yi refers to the score of the ith-ranked document.
We use this method because of its simplicity and its success in previous work [15]. 
We would like this ranking to approximate the ranking of retrievals by the evaluation measure.
Scores are often only computed for the top
