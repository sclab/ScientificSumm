As we shall see, a retrieval function"s spatial autocorrelation  measures the degree to which closely-related documents receive similar scores.
Spatial analysis is appropriate since many retrieval models embed documents in some vector space.
Because of this, we interpret  autocorrelation as measuring the degree to which a retrieval function satisfies the clustering hypothesis.
If the scores of a and b are very different, we may be concerned about the  performance of our system.
The cluster hypothesis states: closely-related documents tend to be relevant to the same request [12].
If documents are embedded in a space , proximity correlates with
