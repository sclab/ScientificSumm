First, our results could affect retrieval algorithm design.
Retrieval algorithms designed to consider spatial autocorrelation will conform to the cluster hypothesis and improve performance.
Our  experiments also demonstrate the limits of the usefulness of our predictors when information from multiple runs is provided.
Second, our results could affect the design of minimal test collection algorithms.
Second, when provided retrievals from other systems, our extended methods demonstrate  competitive performance with state of the art baselines.
Much of the recent work in ranking systems sometimes ignores correlations between document labels and scores.
Our results suggest two conclusions.
We believe that these two
