Evaluation replicates experiments from [19].
Some work even attempts to use zero judgments by  leveraging multiple retrievals for the same query [17].
The task here is not to test the hypothesis system A is superior to system B but to test the hypothesis retrieval A is superior to retrieval B. Autocorrelation manifests itself in many classification tasks.
Therefore, we believe that our work provides explanation for why regularization-based re-ranking works. 
We note, though, that our experiments cover a larger and more diverse set of retrievals, collections, and topics than previously examined.
In column ( a ) , we have predictors
