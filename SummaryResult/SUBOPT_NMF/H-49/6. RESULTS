Surprisingly, we achieve relatively strong  correlations for Spanish and Chinese collections despite our na¨ıve processing.
For every collection, the predictors in column (b) outperform the predictors in column (a), indicating that the information from additional runs can be critical to making good predictions.
Though not always the strongest, autocorrelation achieves  correlations competitive with baseline predictors.
And between our new predictors, the hybrid ρ(˜y, yµ) predictor tends to perform better.
Notice that in the cases where autocorrelation , ρ ( y , ˜y ) , alone performs well ( trec3 , trec5-spanish , and trec6-chinese ) , it is substantially
