In this paper we present our bidding algorithms, discuss their virtues and drawbacks, and compare the  solutions obtained by them to the revenue-maximizing solution found by a centralized winner determination algorithm.
Since the problem is NP-Hard, run time remains exponential on the number of items, but it is remarkably better than an exhaustive search.
Our algorithms always return the set of bids that maximizes the bidder"s utility.
We have developed a couple of bidding algorithms for the bidders in a PAUSE auction.
However, it does not tell us how the bidders should calculate their bids.
PAUSE establishes the
