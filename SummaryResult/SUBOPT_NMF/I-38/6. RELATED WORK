In [9] the  authors present a distributed mechanism for calculating VCG payments in a mechanism design problem.
One approach is given by the algorithms for distributing the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions presented in [7], but these algorithms assume the  computational entities are the items being sold and thus end up with a different type of distribution.
Their  mechanism roughly amounts to having each agent calculate the payments for two other agents and give these to a secure 700 The Sixth Intl.

However , the study of distributed winner determination algorithms for combinatorial auctions is still relatively
