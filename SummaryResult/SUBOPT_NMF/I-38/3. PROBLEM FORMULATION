That is, each bid b in g must satisfy at least one of the two following conditions.
(1) Agent i"s value function is given by vi(S) ∈ where S is a set of items.
Formally , given that W is the current winning bidset , agent i must find a g∗ i such that r ( g∗ i ) ≥ r ( W ) + and g∗ i = arg max g⊆2B ui ( g ) , ( 3 ) where each g is a set of bids that covers all items and ∀b∈g ( b ∈
