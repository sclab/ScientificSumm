Examples of these algorithms are CASS [3], Bidtree [11] and CABOB [12].
Because of their wide applicability, one cannot hope for a general-purpose winner determination algorithm that can efficiently solve every instance of the problem.
Both the research and practice of combinatorial auctions have grown rapidly in the past ten years.
However, most of the existing winner determination algorithms for  combinatorial auctions are centralized, meaning that they require all agents to send their bids to a centralized auctioneer who then determines the winners.
Thus,  several approaches and algorithms have been proposed to  address the winner determination problem.
In this
