When we compared the solutions of our algorithms to the revenue-maximizing solution, we realized that they do not always find the same distribution of items as the revenue-maximizing solution (as shown in Figure 6).
We found that the percentage of revenue of our algorithms increases in average 2.7% as the number of items increases, as shown in Figure 7.
If the revenue-maximizing solution contains the bid (or bids) using these higher  valuation then it is impossible for the PAUSE auction to find this solution because that bid (those bids) is never placed.
The scalability of our algorithms can be determined
