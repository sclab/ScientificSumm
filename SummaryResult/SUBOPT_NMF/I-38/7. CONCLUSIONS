Both algorithms find, most of the time, the same distribution of items as the revenue-maximizing  solution.
Moreover, because of the design of the PAUSE auction, the agents in the auction also have an incentive to perform the required computation.
We have presented two algorithms, pausebid and  cachedpausebid, that bidder agents can use to engage in a PAUSE auction.
Our bidding algorithms can be used by any multiagent system that would use combinatorial auctions for coordination but would rather not implement a centralized auctioneer. 
As it is an NP-Hard problem , the running time of our algorithms remains exponential but it
