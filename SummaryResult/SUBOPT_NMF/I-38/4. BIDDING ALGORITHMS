We set the value of n before calling cpbsearch, to be the size of the list bids (cachedpausebid line 21) in case i), since we want cpbsearch to search over all bids; and we set n to be the number of bids from B included in bids (cachedpausebid line 23) in case ii), since we know that only the those first n bids in bids changed and can affect our current gS .
As in pausebid, we have chosen to distribute the payments in proportion to the agent"s true valuation for each set of items.
