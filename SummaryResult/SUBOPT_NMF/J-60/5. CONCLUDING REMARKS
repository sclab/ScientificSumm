In our examples we choose p such that the maintenance cost over time is negligible.
However, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs.
â€¢ Mechanisms for information propagation and  maintenance.
As a result, the probability that the environment is informed decreases, and  selfish agents would not cooperate.
Incentives for  information propagation should be considered as well (e.g., for P2P networks for file sharing).
The challenge is to find more realistic scenarios in which the partial
