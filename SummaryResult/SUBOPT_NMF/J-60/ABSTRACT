We observe that in many common distributed  environments computational entities can take advantage of the  network structure to collect and distribute information.

This suggests that the standard requirements must be relaxed in order to construct general-purpose mechanisms.
As a result, cooperation is achieved independent of agents" belief.
We thus suggest a notion of partially informed environments.
Even if the information is recorded with some probability , this enables us
