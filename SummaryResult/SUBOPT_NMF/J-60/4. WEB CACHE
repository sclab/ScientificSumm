Let qi(t) denotes the number of loading requests agent i initiated for the item during the time slot t. We assume that vT i (t), the value for caching the item in the beginning of slot t depends only on most recent slot, formally vT i (t) = max{Vi(qi(t − 1)), C}, where Vi(·) is a non-decreasing real function.
It is a dominated strategy to overreport the true value.
• Stage 3: If vA + vB < C, then STOP.
We assume that the only way agent i can affect the true qi ( t ) is by
