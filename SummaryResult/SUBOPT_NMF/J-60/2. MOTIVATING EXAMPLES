The strategy of each player is to report the true load and to challenge with the true load if the other agent overreport.
Now we shall see that overreporting her value is a dominated strategy, as well.
Alice '' s expected payoff gained by misreporting ≤ p ( payoff if she lies and Bob is informed ) + ( 1 − p ) ( max payoff if Bob is not informed ) ≤ p ( −t − βp ) < p ( −t ) + ( 1 − p ) ( −t − βp ) ≤ p ( min payoff
