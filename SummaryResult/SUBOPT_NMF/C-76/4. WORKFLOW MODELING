In addition to these two passive ways to get the events, a provider can also perform active tests.
In the fault detection phase resource events and service events can be generated from different sources.
The fault diagnosis phase is composed of three event  correlation steps.
service dependency resources subservices provider services resource dependency Figure 2: Different kinds of dependencies for the service-oriented event correlation The dependencies depicted in Figure 2 reflect a situation with no redundancy in the service provisioning.
This resource-oriented event correlation deals only with relationships on the resource level (e.g.,  network topology).
The service event correlator does
