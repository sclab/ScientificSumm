After a final input graph is chosen, the graph is  transformed into a correlation matrix where the columns contain the faults and the rows contain the events.
If there is a dependency in the graph, the weight of the corresponding edge is put into the according  matrix cell.
Another possible  weighting could indicate time dependencies.
If this event cannot be reliably detected, the event correlation system  cannot discriminate between the two faults.
In some systems information about the network topology which is needed for the event  correlation is not used explicitly, but is encoded into the rules.
