In order to schedule master/slave applications many task allocation policies were proposed such as Self Scheduling [15] and FAC2 [8].
In this paper, we propose PackageBLAST, an adaptive multi-policy grid service to run BLAST searches in grids composed by segmented genetic databases.
Section 2 presents the sequence comparison problem and the BLAST algorithm.
This led to the idea of grid computing, which involves  cooperative and secure sharing of non-dedicated and  heterogeneous resources that are geographically distributed [5].
The choice of the best allocation policy depends on the application access pattern and on the environment in which it runs [13].
