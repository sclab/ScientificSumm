3.2 Task Allocation Strategies Given a master/slave application composed by a master m and S slaves, the allocation function allocate(m, si, N, S) determines how many tasks out of N must be assigned to a slave si (equation 1), where A(N, S) represents an  allocation policy.
This strategy is appropriate for  homogeneous systems with dedicated resources (equation 3).
