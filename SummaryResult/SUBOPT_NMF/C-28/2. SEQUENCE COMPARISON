BLAST provides programs to compare many combinations of query and database sequence types (table 1).
In the seeding step, a query  sequence is split in portions called words of size W. These words are matched to database sequences and used as  alignment seeds if their scores are higher than a threshold T. In the extension step, alignments are generated from seeds.
