The results collected by running PackageBLAST with 5 allocation policies in a grid testbed were very good.
In  order to compare a 10KBP real DNA sequence against the nr genetic database, we were able to reduce execution time from 30.88 min to 2.11 min.
PackageBLAST contains a framework where the user can choose or incorporate allocation policies.
Also, we showed that, in our testbed, there is no allocation policy that always achieves the best performance and that makes evident the  importance of providing multiple policies.
As future work , we intend to run PackageBLAST in a geographically dispersed grid ,
