The expression used is Φ(m, pi, P) (equation 12), defined as the weighted mean from the last Ω notifications sent by each pi slave node.
This flow continues until all segments are processed. 
The user specifies the sequence to be compared and chooses the allocation strategy.
It calculates the weight of each slave node and decides how many work units will be assigned to a particular slave node, according to the chosen allocation policy.
Φ ( m , pi , P ) = P ∗ P i=1 Γ ( m , pi , Ω ) Γ ( m ,
