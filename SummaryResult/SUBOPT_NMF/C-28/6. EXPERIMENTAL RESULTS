Table 5: PSS evaluation with local workload.
Gain is the comparison of without PSS with PSS 2x Strategy with PSS PSS 2x without PSS Gain Fixed 316 184 393 113.59% SS 186 177 179 1.13% TSS 160 162 171 5.56% GSS 149 159 339 113.21% FAC2 156 165 153 -7.27% As expected, the allocation strategies that assign a large amount of work to the nodes (fixed and GSS) obtained great benefit from using PSS.
The load was started simultaneously 30  seconds after the beginning of BLAST and consisted of the 159 execution of formatdb on the nr database.
