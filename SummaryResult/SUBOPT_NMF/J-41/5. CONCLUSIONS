We hope that the tools we used to establish these results (revenue equivalence, the form of first-price equilibria, the truthful payments rules) will help others wanting to pursue further analyses of slot auctions.
We showed that no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either RBB or RBR using first pricing, but that with second pricing there always exists such an equilibrium (in the case of RBR, an efficient equilibrium).
We also studied the long-run case where agents have experimented with their bids and each settled on one they find optimal.
In general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria , but we
