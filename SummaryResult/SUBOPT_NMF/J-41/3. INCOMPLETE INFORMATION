The probability that y is the kth highest out of N values is N − 1 k − 1 !
(1 − FX (y))k−1 FX (y)N−k whereas the probability that y is the kth highest out of N revenues is the same formula with FR replacing FX .
Let H(y) be the analogous quantity for a bidder with revenue y and relevance 1 in a RBR auction.
Note that the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid in a first-price RBB auction does not depend on a bidder"s relevance α.
So dropping it does not change the set of optimal
