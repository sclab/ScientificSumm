We denote the kth highest of the N declared values by ˜x(k) , and the kth highest of the N declared revenues by ˜r(k) , where the declared revenue of bidder i is ˜ri = αi ˜xi.
Slot k goes to bidder i if and only if ˜ri = ˜r(k) .
Since a bidder"s relevance αi is observable to the seller, the bidder cannot misrepresent it.
It also allows for interesting results in the complete information case.
A common model of  decaying clickthrough rate is the exponential decay model, where γk = 1 δk−1 with decay δ > 1.
The bidder
