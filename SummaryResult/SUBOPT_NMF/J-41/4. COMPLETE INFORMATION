Assume we have a vector (π, b) which satisfies all inequalities above except (6).
By the Farkas lemma , the remaining inequalities can be satisfied if and only if there is no vector z such that X i , j ( γj rσ ( i ) ) zσ ( i ) j > 0 X i > j γjzσ ( i ) j + X i < j γj−1zσ ( i ) j−1 ≤ 0 ∀j ( 7 ) X j zσ ( i ) j ≤ 0 ∀i ( 8 ) zσ ( i ) j ≥ 0 ∀i
