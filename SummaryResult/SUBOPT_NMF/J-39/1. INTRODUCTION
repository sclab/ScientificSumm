Based on this approximation, revenue generated in a simulation of the options-based scheme exceeds  revenue on eBay for the comparable population and sequence of auctions by 14.8%, while the options-based scheme  demonstrates itself as being 7.5% more efficient.
We also extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to  estimate an upper bound on the distribution of value of eBay bidders, taking into account the sequential auction  problem when making the adjustments.
These papers perform equilibrium analysis in simpler settings, assuming bidders can participate in at most two auctions.
The proxy agents use this information to determine how much to
