The lengths of the major jobs that may be released, starting with i = 1, are determined by the following recurrence relation.
The adversary releases major job i ≤ m if and only if each major job j < i was executed continuously over the range [ri, ri+1].
No major job is released after job m. In order to achieve the desired competitive ratio , Γ must complete some major job f , because Γoffline can always at least complete major job 1 ( for a value of 1 ) , and Γ can complete at most one minor job ( for
