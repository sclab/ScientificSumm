This paper also launched the area of  algorithmic mechanism design, in which the mechanism must  sat69 isfy computational requirements in addition to the standard incentive requirements.
For example, [5]  considers an online market clearing setting, in which the  auctioneer matches buy and sells bids (which are assumed to be exogenous) that arrive and expire over time.
In [2], a  general method is presented for converting an online algorithm into an online mechanism that is incentive compatible with respect to values.
Several incentive compatible mechanisms are presented that are based on approximation algorithms for the computationally infeasible optimization problem.
