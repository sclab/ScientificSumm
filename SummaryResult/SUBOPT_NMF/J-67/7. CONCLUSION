We presented a mechanism that is incentive  compatible with respect to release time, deadline, length and value, and that only increases the competitive ratio by one.
We also showed how this mechanism could be simplified when k = 1 and each agent cannot lie about the length of its job.
Also , while we feel that it is reasonable to strengthen the assumption of knowing the maximum possible ratio of value densities ( k ) to knowing the actual range of possible value densities , it would be interesting to determine whether there exists a ( ( 1 + âˆš
