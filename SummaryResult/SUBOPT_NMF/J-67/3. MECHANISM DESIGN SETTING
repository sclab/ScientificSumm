Each agent"s utility, ui(g(ˆθ), θi) = vi · µ(ei(ˆθ, di) ≥ li) · µ( ˆdi ≤ di) − pi(ˆθ), is a quasi-linear function of its value for its job (if completed and returned by its true deadline) and the payment it makes to the center.
As before, preemption of jobs is allowed, and job switching takes no time.
That is, even if job i is completed before ˆdi, the center does not return the job to agent i until that time.
In a standard mechanism design setting , the outcome is enforced at the
