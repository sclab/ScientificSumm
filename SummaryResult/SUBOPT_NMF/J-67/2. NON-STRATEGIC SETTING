Also, overload S(·) and ei(·) so that they can also take a vector θ as an argument.
For example, S(θ, t) is shorthand for the S(t) of the outcome f(θ), and it denotes the active job at time t when the input is θ.
The other variable, p loss, is equal to the length of the first active job of the current interval.
The up and down arrows represent ri and di,  respectively, while the length of the box equals li. 
In order to decide whether to preempt the active job , TD1 ( version
