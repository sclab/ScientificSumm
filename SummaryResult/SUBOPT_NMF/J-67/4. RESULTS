We can then show that job i has a higher priority at time tf as follows: ˆvx+ √ k·ex((ˆθi, ˆθ−i), tf ) = ˆvx+ √ k·ex((ˆθi, ˆθ−i), tp ) < ˆvi + √ k · ei((ˆθi, ˆθ−i), tp ) ≤ ˆvi + √ k · ei((ˆθi, ˆθ−i), tf ),  contradicting the fact that job x is active at time tf .
Let tf ∈ [tp , ta ] be the earliest time in this range that some job x ∈ X is active, which implies that ex((ˆθi, ˆθ−i), tf ) = ex((ˆθi, ˆθ−i), tp ).
Also , declaring ˆri > ta could not cause the job to be
