have been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as, for instance, BDICTL ([22]) and KARO ([17]).
Aim of the present paper is to fill this gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal  foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its relation to the organizational one.
Concretely , in Section 2 , a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution , norm , role , and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones
