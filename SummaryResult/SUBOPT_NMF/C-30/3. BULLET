In  addition, because nodes recover data from participants chosen uniformly at random from the set of non-descendants, it is advantageous to make each transmitted packet recoverable from approximately the same number of participant nodes.
The sending factor sfi is the portion of the parent stream (rate) that each child should own based on the number of descendants the child has.
These factors determine the proportion of p"s received data rate that it will forward to each child.
In contrast, Bullet nodes are aware of the bandwidth  achievable to each of its children using the underlying transport.
Because RanSub
