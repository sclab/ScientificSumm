RanSub periodically disseminates summaries of data sets received by a changing, uniformly random subset of global participants.
This paper presents the design and implementation of Bullet, a scalable and efficient overlay construction algorithm that overcomes this challenge to deliver significant bandwidth improvements relative to traditional tree structures.
â€¢ We provide a technique for recovering missing data from peers in a scalable and efficient manner.
Of course, a number of difficult  challenges must be overcome to ensure that nodes in the mesh do not repeatedly receive the same data from peers.
As a related benefit , we eliminate the overhead required
