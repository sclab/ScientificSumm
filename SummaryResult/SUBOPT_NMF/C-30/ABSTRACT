We construct Bullet around the insight that data should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in the network.
Key contributions of this work include : i ) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally likely to appear at any node , ii ) a scalable and decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover missing data items , and iii ) a complete implementation and evaluation of Bullet running across the Internet and in a large-scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth
