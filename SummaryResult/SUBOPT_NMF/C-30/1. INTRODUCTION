In this example, Bullet would transmit a disjoint set of data at 1 Mbps to each of A and B.
A and B would then each independently discover the availability of disjoint data at the remote peer and begin streaming data to one another, effectively achieving a retrieval rate of 2 Mbps.
In this way, we avoid the problem of locating the last object, which may only be available at a few nodes.
Third, the  algorithm should be decentralized and scalable to thousands of participants.
Bullet nodes begin by self-organizing into an overlay tree , which can be constructed by
