We do not disseminate packets every T seconds; instead we forward them as soon as they arrive.
We set link bandwidths according to the medium range from Table 1, and randomly assign 100 overlay participants.
The randomly chosen root either streams at 900 Kbps (over a random tree for  Bullet and greedy bottleneck tree for anti-entropy recovery), or sends packets at that rate to randomly chosen nodes for  gossiping.
It does so by assigning ownership of data objects to children in a manner that makes the expected number of nodes holding a particular data object equal for all data objects
