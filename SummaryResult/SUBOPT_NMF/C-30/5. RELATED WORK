It then runs a standard routing protocol on top of the overlay mesh to construct  forwarding trees using each node as a possible source.
Overcast [21] is an example of a bandwidth-efficient  overlay tree construction algorithm.
Instead of a node waiting to get the data it missed from a new parent, a node can start getting data from its perpendicular peers.
Instead, Bullet uses the summary views it obtains through RanSub to guide its actions toward nodes with disjoint  content.
Since lbpcast does not require an underlying tree for data distribution and relies on the push-gossiping model , its network
