We of course have to define clearly what it means for an attribute to strongly dominate other attributes.
We again appeal to the Assumption 1 on additivity of utility functions to achieve a measure of fairness within this negotiation setting.
Then, an attribute ∈ Simp strongly dominates the rest of the attributes in Simp (for agent i) iff wi > P j∈(Simp− ) wi j .
Assume also that negotiator 2 assigns utilities of 1, 0.9, 0.7, and 0.4 to A, B, C, and D,  respectively.
So far , we have been concentrating on the efficiency issue while leaving the fairness issue
