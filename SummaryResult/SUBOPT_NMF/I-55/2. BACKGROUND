To measure how much an  outcome o fulfills an objective j to an agent i, we use objective functions: for each agent i, we define i"s interests using the objective vector function fi = [fij ] : O → Rni .
Thus, for each agent i, there is a value function σi : Rni → R. In particular, Raiffa [17] shows how to systematically  construct an additive value function to each party involved in a negotiation.
A decision a ∈ A whose consequence does not lie on the Pareto frontier is inefficient.
An outcome o ∈ O is represented by an assignment of
