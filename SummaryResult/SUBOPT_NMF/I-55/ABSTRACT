We  separate out attributes that take a finite set of values (simple attributes) from those with continuous values, and we show that for simple attributes, the mediator can determine the Pareto-optimal values.
In addition we show that if none of the simple attributes strongly dominates the other simple attributes, then truth telling is an  equilibrium strategy for negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes.
We also describe an approach for improving joint gains on non-simple attributes, by moving the parties in a series of steps, towards the Pareto-optimal frontier.
