Methods of organizing search results based on text  categorization are studied in [6, 8].

Recently, search logs have been used for suggesting query substitutes [12], personalized search [19], Web site design [3], Latent Semantic Analysis [23], and learning retrieval  ranking functions [16, 10, 1].
In [9, 15], the authors used Scatter/Gather algorithm to cluster the top documents returned from a  traditional information retrieval system.
Thus the obtained clusters do not
