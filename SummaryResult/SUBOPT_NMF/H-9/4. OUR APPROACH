Within each aspect, the search results are ranked according to their original search engine ranking. 
Then, for each pair of documents di and dj (i = j), their similarity is computed as the cosine score of their corresponding vectors vi and vj , that is sim(di, dj ) = cos(vi, vj) = vi · vj |vi| · |vj | .
Then the clusters are formed by dense subgraphs that are star-shaped.
We describe the star clustering algorithm below.
Given the top m Web pages returned by a search engine for q: {s1, ..., sm}, we group them into different aspects using a categorization algorithm.
