Second, with the proposed way of organizing search results, we can  expect to obtain informative feedback information from a user (e.g., the aspect chosen by a user to view).
The experiments show that our log-based method can consistently outperform cluster-based method and improve over the ranking baseline, especially when the queries are difficult or the search results are diverse.
In  particular, we hope to develop probabilistic models for learning aspects and organizing results simultaneously.
We compared our log-based method with the  traditional cluster-based method and the baseline of search  engine ranking.
There are several interesting directions for further extending our
