Each session  contains a single query and several clicks.
Different test cases may have the same queries but possibly different clicks.)
To test our algorithm, we separate the whole data set into two parts according to the time: the first 2/3 data is used to simulate the historical data that a search engine  accumulated, and we use the last 1/3 to simulate future queries.
For each test case , i.e. , each session , we count the number of different clicks and filter out those test cases with fewer than 4 clicks under the assumption that a query with more
