Let ˜δ(b, j) be defined as follows.
For every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B, pj(b) = b(j+1) cj , where cj ≥ 1.
For every j ∈ K, let ˜δ(b, j) be the player i that obtains position j, and for j = m let ˜δ(b, j) = i, where i obtained position m in case there is more than one player i such that bi = b(m), then i is chosen between them via the breaking rule ˜γ.
Therefore player i '' s utility will be αjβi ( vi − b˜δ ( b ,
