It is sufficient to show that whenever 1 ≤ s(v, i) < s(v, l) ≤ m + 1 for some i = l, then s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
In this case bδ(v,1)(v) > bj(v) for every j = i, s(b(v), i) = 1.
Let v ∈ V be an arbitrary valuation vector.
Since s(v, i) < s(v, l), the fixed priority rule implies that i < l. By the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v).
If all players choose the mediator then by
