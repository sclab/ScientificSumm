If ˆv2 > ˆv1, the mediator makes the bids b1 = 0, b2 = ˆv1.
If only one player uses the mediator services, say player i, then mediator mc bids bi = cˆvi on behalf of i.
If player 1 deviates by using the mediator"s services and reporting ˆv1 ≥ v2 his utility is still v1 − v2.
Consider a self-price auction G = G(α, p) with 2 players and one position, with α1 = 1.
It is interesting to note that this simple example can not be extended to general self-price position auctions, as will be discussed in section 4.
This motivates
