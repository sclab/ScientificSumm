We denote by b(j) the jth highest bid in b.
We deal with anonymous position payment schemes, i.e.
For example if b = (3, 7, 3, 0, 2) then b(1) = 7, b(2) = 3, b(3) = 3, b(4) = 2, b(5) = 0.
2.2 The payment schemes Let α be a click-trough rate vector.
We further assume that a player never pays more than his bid.
Every vector of bids b and a permutation γ uniquely determine an allocation.
For convenience , a position auction will be described either by its position payment scheme or by its player payment
