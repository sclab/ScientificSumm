8 We also performed experiments with different precision, other valuation distributions, and dynamic local bidders.
The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.
The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all  auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.
The local bidders are static and bid their valuation as before.
Thus , our simulation can be used as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the optimal bidding strategy for practical settings
