In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local  bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.
â€¢ Empirically, we find that a bidder"s expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.
Within this setting , we are able to characterise , for the first time , a bidder '' s utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions
