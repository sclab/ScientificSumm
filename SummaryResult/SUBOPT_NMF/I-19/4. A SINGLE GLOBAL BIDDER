Furthermore, we assume that the global bidders have complete knowledge about the number of rounds and the number of auctions in each round.
In the  following, the number of simultaneous auctions in round r is denoted by Mr, and the set of bids in that round by Br.
For high valuation buyers, however, the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single auction.
The expected utility thus becomes : Ur = v · Pr ( Br ) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg ( y ) dy + Ur+1 ·
