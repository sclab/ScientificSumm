This analysis extends to online markets where, typically,  auctions occur both concurrently and sequentially.
These results hold both in the case where the number of local bidders is known and when this number is determined by a Poisson distribution.
For this case, we prove that, assuming free  disposal, the global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions, irrespective of the local bidders"  valuation distribution.
Furthermore, for non-decreasing valuation distributions, we prove that the problem of finding the  optimal bids reduces to two dimensions.
In addition , by combining analytical and simulation results , we demonstrate that
