If M is low (i.e., for M = 2), a global bidder  significantly increases the efficiency, especially for low values of 9 Trivial exceptions are when either M = 1 or N = 1 and  bidders are static, since the market is then completely efficient without a global bidder.
Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the presence of a global bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case the local bidders are static.
To conclude, the impact of a global bidder on the efficiency clearly depends on the information that is available.
On the other hand , as a result of
