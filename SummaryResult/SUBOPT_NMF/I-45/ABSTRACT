We investigate how  commitmentbased interactions can be implemented in conventional agent-oriented programming languages.
In this  paper we consider one approach for modelling agent interactions: the commitment machines framework.
This framework supports  modelling interactions at a higher level (using social commitments),  resulting in more flexible interactions.
Although agent interaction plays a vital role in MAS, and  messagecentric approaches to agent interaction have their drawbacks, present agent-oriented programming languages do not provide support for implementing agent interaction that is flexible and robust.
Instead, messages are provided as a primitive building block.
