[8]) also uses  commitments, and deals with implementation.
It would be interesting to compare commitment machines with Hermes, but, since  commitment machines are a framework, not a design methodology, we need to compare Hermes with a methodology for designing  interactions that results in commitment machines [13, 17]. 
Although we have implemented the NetBill interaction using 3APL, the changes to the semantics were done by modifying our NetBill 3APL program, rather than by modifying the 3APL  implementation itself.
We have presented a scheme for mapping commitment machines to BDI platforms ( using SAAPL as an exemplar ) , identified three changes
