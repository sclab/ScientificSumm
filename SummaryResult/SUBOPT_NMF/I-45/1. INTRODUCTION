Indeed, modern AOPLs [1], with virtually no exceptions, provide only simple message sending as the basis for implementing agent interaction.
There has also been work on richer forms of interaction in specific settings, such as teams of  cooperative agents [5, 11].
Intelligent agents should exhibit the ability to persist in achieving their goals in the face of failure (robustness) by trying different approaches (flexibility).
This paper presents what, to the best of our knowledge, is the second AOPL to support high-level, flexible, and robust agent  interaction implementation.
Recognising these limitations of the traditional approach to designing agent interactions , a
