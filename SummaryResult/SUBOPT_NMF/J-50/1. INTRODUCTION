In this paper, we will focus on the communication  requirements of a generally applicable subclass of social choice rules, commonly known as voting rules.
For each rule, we first give an upper bound on the (deterministic)  communication complexity by providing a communication protocol for it and analyzing how many bits need to be transmitted in this protocol.
Segal also studies social choice rules in general , and shows that for a large class of social choice rules , supporting budget sets must be revealed such that if every agent prefers the same outcome in her budget set , this proves
