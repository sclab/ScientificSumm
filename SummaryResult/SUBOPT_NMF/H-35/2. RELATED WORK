This ‘pair-wise" approach fits well with information retrieval and thus is widely used in IR.
In the pair-wise approach to ranking, the learning task is  formalized as a problem of classifying instance pairs into two categories (correctly ranked and incorrectly ranked).
They are ‘learning to rank", boosting, and direct optimization of performance measures.
Freund and Schapire have proposed the first well-known boosting algorithm called AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) [9], which is designed for binary  classification (0-1 prediction).
For instance, Joachims [17] presents an SVM method to directly  optimize nonlinear multivariate performance measures like the F1  measure for classification.
