Ideally we want to maximize the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure on the training data: max f∈F m i=1 E(π(qi, di, f), yi), (4) where F is the set of possible ranking functions.
This is equivalent to minimizing the loss on the training data min f∈F m i=1 (1 − E(π(qi, di, f), yi)).
For example, a weak ranker can be created by using a subset of queries (together with their document list and label list) sampled according to the distribution Pt.
At each round , a weak ranker ht is constructed based
