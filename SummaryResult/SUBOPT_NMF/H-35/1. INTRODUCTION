For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking models by minimizing  classification errors on instance pairs.
From the viewpoint of IR, AdaRank can be viewed as a machine learning method for ranking model tuning.
Experimental results indicate that AdaRank can outperform the  baseline methods of BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost, on four benchmark datasets including OHSUMED, WSJ, AP, and .Gov.
For example, Herbrich et al.
[8] take a similar approach and perform the learning by using boosting,  referred to as RankBoost.
In ranking, given a new query, the corresponding retrieved documents are sorted by using the trained ranking model.
