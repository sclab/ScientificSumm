The results reported in Figure 3 and 4 are those  averaged over four trials on WSJ and AP datasets, respectively.
We conducted t-tests on the  improvements of AdaRank.MAP and AdaRank.NDCG over BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost on WSJ and AP.
200 queries are selected from the TREC topics (No.101 âˆ¼ No.300).
