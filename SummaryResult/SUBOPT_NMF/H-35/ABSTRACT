Ideally a learning  algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data.
For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking  models by minimizing classification errors on instance pairs.
Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by  minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures.
To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures.
Our algorithm , referred to as AdaRank , repeatedly constructs â€˜weak rankers '' on
