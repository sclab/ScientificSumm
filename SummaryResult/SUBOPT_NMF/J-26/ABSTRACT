In our setting a  principal must motivate a team of strategic agents to exert costly effort on his behalf, but their actions are hidden from him.
Our focus is on cases where complex combinations of the efforts of the agents influence the outcome.
Our model is a combinatorial variant of the classical  principalagent problem from economic theory.
This paper deals with a complementary problem in such settings: handling the hidden actions that are  performed by the different parties.
The principal motivates the agents by offering to them a set of contracts , which together put the agents in an equilibrium
