Claim 1.
, an), then a  success function must satisfy: ∀i ∈ N, ∀a−i ∈ A−i t(1, a−i) > t(0, a−i) Additionally, we assume that t(a) > 0 for any a ∈ A (or equivalently, t(0, 0, .
, an) being the probability that f(x1, .
Thus we will assume a  monotone Boolean function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} which denotes 21 whether the project succeeds as a function of the success of the n agents" tasks (and is not determined by any set of n−1 agents).
, xn are chosen according to the following distribution : if
