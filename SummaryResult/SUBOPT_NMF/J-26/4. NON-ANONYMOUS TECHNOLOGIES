For any other set Z, we define t(Z) in a way that ensures that the marginal contribution of each agent in Z is a very small (the technical details appear in the full version).
Let S be an optimal contract for f = g V h on v. Then, T is an optimal contract for h on v · tg(R), and R is an optimal contract for g on v · th(T).
We first show that it is better than any other S ∈ S. At the value vS = ck 2 2 S , the set S
