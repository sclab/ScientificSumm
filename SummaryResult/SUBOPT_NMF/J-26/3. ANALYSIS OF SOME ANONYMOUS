For any anonymous OR technology, there exist finite positive values v1 < v2 < .
7 AND technology with any number of agents n and any γ , and any identical cost c. 8 v∗ is a function of n , γ , c. 23 • the price of unaccountability is obtained at the transition point of the agency case , and is POU = ` 1 γ − 1 ´n−1 + ( 1 − γ 1 − γ ) Proof sketch : For any fixed number of contracted agents , k , the principal '' s utility is a linear function in
