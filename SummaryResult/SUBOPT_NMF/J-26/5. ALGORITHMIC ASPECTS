If |T| > k, then t(T) = 1 − (n − |T|) · .
We go over all sets T such that t(T) > t(S), and  calculate the value for which the principal is indifferent between contracting with T and contracting with S. The minimal  indifference value is the next transition point and the contract that has the minimal indifference value is the next optimal contract.
Thus the problem we address will be : The Optimal Contract Problem for Read Once Networks : Input : A read-once network G = ( V , E ) , with two specific vertices s
