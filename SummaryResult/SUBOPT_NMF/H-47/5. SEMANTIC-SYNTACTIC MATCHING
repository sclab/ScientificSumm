This will be further discussed in the next section.
In this example, in the absence of ski ads, a page about skiing  containing the word Atomic could be matched to the available snowboarding ad for the same brand.
To capture both the generalization and efficiency  requirements we define the TaxScore function as follows: TaxScore(PC, AC) = X pc∈P C X ac∈AC idist(LCA(pc, ac), ac)·cWeight(pc)·cWeight(ac) In this function we consider every combination of page class and ad class.
To calculate the keyword score we use the vector space model [ 1 ] where both the
