However, SVMs typically require training time that is quadratic in the number of training examples, and are impractical for  largescale email systems.
In content  analysis, the actual message text (often including hyper-text and meta-text, such as HTML and headers) is analyzed using machine learning techniques for text classification to  determine if the given content is spam.
It has not yet been empirically demonstrated that SVMs give  improved performance over these methods in an online spam detection setting [4].
The most well known form of spam is email spam, which remains a major problem for large email systems.
