4.2.1 Experimental Setup We compared Online SVMs and ROSVM on email spam, blog comment spam, and splog detection.
The splog and blog data sets were much smaller, so we set p = 100 for these tasks to allow meaningful comparisons between the reduced size and full size optimization problems.
These results show that for content-based spam detection, we can reduce computational cost by  allowing only a single SMO iteration (that is, T = 1) with effectively equivalent performance.
Other parameters were identical to the original Online SVM tests.
Here, we tested these methods together to  create a full implementation of ROSVM.
