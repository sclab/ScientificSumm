Then, if the true probability of A is p, her expected profit is SSR-PROFIT([r, r ]) = p(sA(r )−sA(r))+(1−p)(sB(r )−sB(r)) Now, let us represent the initial and final position in terms of circular coordinates.
Then , expanding the spherical scoring functions sA , sB , the player '' s profit for a move from r to r can be rewritten in terms of the corresponding coordinates x , x as : SSR-PROFIT ( [ x , x ] ) = p · ( x − x ) For any collection X of moves ,
