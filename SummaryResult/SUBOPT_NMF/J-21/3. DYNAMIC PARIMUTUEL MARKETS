Suppose player i is about to make a move in a dynamic parimutuel market in a state (M, x, y), and the true probability of event A is p. Then, assuming the market is liquidated after i"s move, • If x y < q p 1−p , player i profits by buying shares in A , or selling shares in B.
We show that the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a DPM with true probability p correspond strategically to the infinitesimal payoffs and profits of a projection game with odds p p/ ( 1 − p ) , in the following
