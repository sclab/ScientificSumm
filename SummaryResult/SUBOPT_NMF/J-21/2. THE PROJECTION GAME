The cost can be expressed in an alternative form, that is also useful.
Suppose player i moves from (x, y) to (x , y ).
2.1 Strategicproperties oftheprojectiongame We begin our strategic analysis of the projection game by observing the following simple path-independence property.
When x moves along a circle centered at the origin to point ¯x on the positive p-line, the corresponding payoff is P(x, ¯x) = |x| − x · q, and the cost is C[x, ¯x] = 0.
For ease of reference, we summarize some more useful properties of the cost and payoff functions in the projection game.
