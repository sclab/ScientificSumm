We demonstrate that this game can serve as a strategic model of dynamic parimutuel markets, and also captures the essence of the strategies in market scoring rules.
Our central contribution is a new abstract betting game, the projection game, that serves as a useful model for information  markets.
The  projection game is tractable to analyze, and has an attractive geometric visualization that makes the strategic moves and interactions more transparent.
We develop an analytic method to guide the design and strategic analysis of information markets.
We use it to prove several strategic properties about the dynamic parimutuel market.
