For each number of agents, three bars are shown: individual, Voting, and AMAL.
The individual bar shows the average accuracy of individual agents  predictions; the voting bar shows the average accuracy of the joint prediction achieved by voting but without any argumentation; and finally the AMAL bar shows the average accuracy of the joint  prediction using argumentation.
The  reason is that the soybean data set is more difficult (in the sense that agents need more data to produce good predictions).
Figure 6 contains three plots , where NL ( not learning ) shows accuracy of an agent with no learning
