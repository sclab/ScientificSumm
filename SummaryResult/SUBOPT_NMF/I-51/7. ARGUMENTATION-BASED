The protocol is initiated because one of the agents receives a problem P to be solved.
Otherwise, the agent Ai owner of the token tries to generate a counterargument for each of the opposing  arguments in contradict(αt i) ⊆ Ht (see Section 6.1).
If CAi ( βt i ) > CAi ( αt i ) , then Ai considers that βt i is stronger than its previous argument , changes its argument to βt i by sending assert ( βt i ) to the rest of the agents ( the intuition behind this is that since a
