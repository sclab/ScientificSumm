Thus a counterexample is also a counterargument, one that states that a specific argument α is not always true, and the evidence  provided is the case c. Specifically, for a case c to be a  counterexample of an argument α, the following conditions have to be met: α.D c and α.S = c.S, i.e.
In our framework , a counterargument consists of a justified prediction Aj , P , S , D generated by an agent Aj with the intention to rebut an argument α generated by another agent Ai , that endorses a solution class S different from that of
