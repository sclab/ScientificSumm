the confidence on a justified prediction is the number of  endorsing cases divided by the number of endorsing cases plus  counterexamples.
In our framework, agents use this joint confidence as the  preference relation: a justified prediction α is preferred over another one β if C(α) ≥ C(β). 
Basically, we will define a confidence measure for each justified prediction (that takes into account the cases owned by each agent), and the justified prediction with the highest confidence will be the preferred one.
