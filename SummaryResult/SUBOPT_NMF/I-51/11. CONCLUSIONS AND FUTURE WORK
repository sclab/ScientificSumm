Finally, our approach is focused on lazy learning, and future works aims at incorporating eager  inductive learning inside the argumentative framework for learning from communication. 
The experimental evaluation shows that the  increased amount of information provided to the agents by the  argumentation process increases their predictive accuracy, and specially when an adequate number of agents take part in the argumentation.
Finally , in the experiments presented here a learning agent would retain all counterexamples submitted by the other agent ; however , this is a very simple case retention policy , and we will like to experiment with more informed
