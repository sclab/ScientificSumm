The agents use case-based reasoning (CBR) [1] to learn from past cases (where a case is a situation and its outcome) in order to predict the outcome of a new situation.
Then  Section 3 introduces our multi-agent CBR (MAC) framework and the notion of justified prediction.
Thus, we  consider a scenario with agents that (1) work in the same domain using a shared ontology, (2) are capable of learning from examples, and (3) communicate using an argumentative framework.
Sections 5 and 6 present our case-based preference relation and argument generation policies  respectively.
Most existing argumentation frameworks for multi-agent systems are
