Approaches for logic and languages that support argumentation include defeasible logic [4] and BDI models [13].
Our work on multi-agent case-based learning started in 1999 [6]; later Mc Ginty and Smyth [7] presented a multi-agent collaborative CBR approach (CCBR) for planning.
Research on MAS argumentation focus on several issues like a) logics, protocols and languages that support argumentation, b)  argument selection and c) argument interpretation.
The main difference is that our MAC approach is a way to distribute the Reuse process of CBR ( using a voting system ) while Retrieve is performed individually by each agent ; the other
