Thus, all of them can compute H0 = α0 1, α0 2, α0 3 .
A3 comes up with the justified prediction α1 3 = A3, P, hadromerida, D4 , and broadcasts it to the rest of the agents with the message assert(α1 3).
Agent A3 receives the counterargument and assesses its local  confidence.
At Round 3, since all the agents agree (all the justified  predictions in H3 predict hadromerida as the solution class) The  protocol ends, and A1 (the agent that received the problem) considers hadromerida as the joint solution for the problem P. 
Thus , all of them know the new
