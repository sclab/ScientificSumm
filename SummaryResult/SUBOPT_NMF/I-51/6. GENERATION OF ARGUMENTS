However, there is no guarantee that such counterarguments will always win, since, as we have stated in Section 5, agents in our framework use a  preference relation based on joint confidence.
Specifically, in our experiments, when an agent Ai wants to rebut an argument α, uses the following policy: 1.
When the description covers only (or almost only) cases of a  single solution class LID terminates and predicts that solution class.
Moreover, Figure 4 shows the generation of a counterargument β1 2 for the argument α0 1 (in Figure 3) that is a specialization of α0 1.
Moreover , one
