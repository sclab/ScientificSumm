First look at the performance of HAP teams in Fig.
From Fig.
4) decreased constantly as time proceeded.
The experiment results are plotted in Figures 4, 6, and 7.
These also hold for the Agent teams (upper one in Fig.
Compared to two-party performatives, multi-party  performatives are preferable for forming shared mental models.
5(b)), it is hard to form team-level SMM especially when the team size is big (missing one Inform will nullify all others" efforts).
Let Mi = {Tk ∈ T|k ≤ i, Tk = ∅}.
In addition , we controlled agents '' outgoing communication capacities by varying from
