It allows selective (selected subset) or holistic info-sharing.
SMMall has also implemented the HMM-based models (Section 3) to allow an agent to estimate its human  partner"s and other team members" cognitive/processing loads.
If there are n team members, each agent needs to maintain 2n HMM-based models to support the load displays.
Thus, info-cell Cij of a map encodes all the beliefs (instances) of information type j held by agent i.
MMOP of a group is defined as the intersection of all the individual mental states relative to the union of  individual mental states of the group.
