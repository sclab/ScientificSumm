Obviously, the H(k,u,m,v,n) model has the following good properties: Property 1: The diameter of H(k,u,m,v,n) model is m+n.
2) The k different hypercubes obtained above are encoded as j1j2…jm, which are called Out-Cluster-Hypercube-Node-Codes, where 0 ≤ j1,j2,…jm ≤ u-1,u=[ m k ].
3 ) Any node A in H ( k , u , m , v , n ) can be encoded as ( i , j ) , where i ( i=i1i2…in , 0 ≤ i1 , i2 , …in ≤ v-1 ) is the In-Cluster-HypercubeNode-Code
