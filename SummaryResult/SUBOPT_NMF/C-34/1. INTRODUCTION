Though the random pairwise keys scheme doses not suffer from the above security problem, it incurs a high memory overhead, which increases linearly with the number of nodes in the network if the level of security is kept constant [2][4].
Based on this grid, each sensor node can then identify whether it can directly establish a pairwise key with another node, and if not, what intermediate nodes it can contact to indirectly establish the pairwise key.
The random subset assignment scheme assigns each sensor node the secrets generated from a random subset of polynomials in the polynomial pool.
