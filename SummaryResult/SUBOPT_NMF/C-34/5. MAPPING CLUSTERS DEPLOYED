So, it is obvious that there exists a path key between nodes A and B.
57 According to the properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, we can prove that the following theorem by combing the proof of theorem 2: Theorem 3: Supposing that there exist no compromised nodes in the sensor network, and the distance between node A and B, then there exists a shortest key path with k distance between node A and B logically.
From the following example we can know that there are many parallel paths in the H ( k , u ,
