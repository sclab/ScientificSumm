Definition 2 (Pairwise Key): For any two nodes A and B, if they have a common key E, then the key E is called a pairwise key between them.
Definition 3 (Key Path): For any two nodes A0 and Ak, when there has not a pairwise key between them, if there exists a path A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak, and there exists at least one pairwise key between the nodes Ai and Aj for 0≤i≤k-1 and 1≤j≤k, then the path consisted of A0,A1,A2,……,Ak-1,Ak is called a Key Path between A0 and Ak.
