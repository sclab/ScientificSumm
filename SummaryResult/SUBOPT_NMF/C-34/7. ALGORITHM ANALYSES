But even if the intruders succeed to do that, node u and v can still  reestablish indirect pairwise key through alternative intermediate nodes.
Construct a function as f(t)= vt -1- t(v-1), where t ≥ 2.
Let p=x+n, then there is um *vn = vx * vn ⇒ um =vx ⇒ x=tm.
1) If u,v can establish direct pairwise key, then the only way to compromise the key is to compromise the common bivariate polynomial f(x,y) between u,v.
Supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is N , Figure.5 illustrates the comparison between
