We found that the performance of the Perceptorn models was the best.
In this paper, we showed that the approach can work for extraction from general documents as well.
We tried different machine learning models including Perceptron, Maximum Entropy, Maximum Entropy Markov Model, and Voted Perceptron.
Previous work showed that the machine learning approach can work well for metadata extraction from research papers.
It appeared that using formatting information is a key for successfully conducting title extraction from general documents.
Previous work on metadata extraction mainly used linguistic features in documents, while we mainly used formatting information.
We have tried
