In this paper, we employ a modification of BM25 that allows field weighting [21].
First, for each term in the query we count the term frequency in each field of the document; each field frequency is then weighted according to the corresponding weight parameter: âˆ‘= f tfft tfwwtf Similarly, we compute the document length as a weighted sum of lengths of each field.
As fields, we make use of body, title, extracted title and anchor.
Average document length in the corpus becomes the average of all weighted document lengths.
A ranking function in search can use different weights for different
