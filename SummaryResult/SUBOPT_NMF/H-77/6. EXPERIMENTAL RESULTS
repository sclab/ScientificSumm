There are cases in which all the lines have the same font size (i.e., the largest font size), or cases in which the lines with the largest font size only contain general descriptions like ‘Confidential", ‘White paper", etc.
The results indicate that the improvements of machine learning over baselines are statistically significant ( in the sense
