The domain axioms, denoted as Δ, are a finite and  possibly empty set of formulae ϕ → (ϕ1 ∧ · · · ∧ ϕn) where ϕ, ϕi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are atomic first-order formulae.

Rather than making use of sophisticated formalisms for ontology construction, we employ a set of domain axioms, defined below: DEF.

We propose a simple means to account for such relationships and show how these can be connected to the mechanisms introduced above.
A set of norms can
