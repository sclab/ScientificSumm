5.1 Using Annotated Norms We now explain how annotated norms are used by norm-aware agents.
We show 1 main(Id, Roles) ← 2 get tuple( I, s, Ξ, Ω )∧ 3 terminate(Id, Roles, I, Ξ, Ω) 4 main(Id, Roles) ← 5 get tuple( I, s, Ξ, Ω )∧ 6 filter norms(Id, Roles, Ω, ΩId )∧ 7 discuss norms(Id, Roles, I, s, Ξ, ΩId , Actions)∧ 8 update tuple(Roles, Actions, NewRoles)∧ 9 main(Id, NewRoles) Figure 5: Governor Agent as a Logic Program the lines of our clauses numbered 1-9.
The governor agents have access
