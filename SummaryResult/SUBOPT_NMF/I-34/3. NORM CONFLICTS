We detect the overlapping of the norms" influences, i.e.
We define below how we obtain the set of conflicting norms of a normative state Ω: DEF.
The illustration shows the space of possible values for p(X, Y ) and p(X, Y ) PA:Rp(c, X) Fa:bp(Y, Z) p(X, Y ) Fa:bp(Y, Z) PA:Rp(c, X) Figure 2: Overlap of Influence (Left) and Curtailment (Right) two portions of this space defining the scope of influence of norms PA:Rp(c, X) and Fa:bp(Y, Z).
It maps an existing set Ω possibly with
