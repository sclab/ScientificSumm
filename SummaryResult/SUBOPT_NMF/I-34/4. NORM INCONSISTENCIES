The conflict resolution algorithm can be applied without change to accumulate a maximal conflict set ΣMAX c for each prohibition in Ω that unifies with obligations. 
If a substitution σ can be found that unifies an obligation and a prohibition, then a situation of norm inconsistency occurs [13].
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 647 express the nature of a conflict between a prohibition and  permission.
Similarly, a situation of inconsistency can be defined reusing this definition and replacing the P deontic modality with O.
We can reuse the machinery for conflict resolution , developed previously , for
