A norm, generically referred to as ν, is any construct of the form Oτ:τ ϕ, Pτ:τ ϕ, or Fτ:τ ϕ, where τ, τ are either  variables or constants and ϕ is a first-order atomic formula.
A global execution state of a VO, denoted as Ξ, is a finite, possibly empty, set of tuples a : r, ¯ϕ, t where a ∈ Agents is an agent identifier, r ∈ Roles is a role label, ¯ϕ is a ground first-order atomic formula, and t ∈ IN is a time stamp.
Each formula is a truthful record of an action specified
