Let S be a conflict-free set of arguments, and let T : 2A → 2A be a function such that T (S) = {a | a is defended by S}.
• S is a complete extension iff S = T (S).
Theorem 1.
• The offer o is rejected for the negotiating agent iff ∀ a ∈ F(o), a is rejected.
Let S ⊆ A.
In a negotiation dialogue, agents propose and accept offers that are acceptable for them, and reject bad ones.
Now that the acceptability semantics is defined, we are ready to define the status of any argument.
