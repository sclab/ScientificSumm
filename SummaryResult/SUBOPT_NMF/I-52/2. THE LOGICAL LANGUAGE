In [4], it has been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for decision making, two kinds of arguments are distinguished: arguments supporting choices (or decisions), and arguments supporting beliefs.
Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the  arguments of Argsb(L).
a = a , a RL a • a ∈ Argso(L) and a ∈ Argsb(L) such that a RL a Note that the relation RL is not symmetric.
The idea here is to return the strongest argument among these arguments.
Thus, Args(L) = Argso(L) ∪ Argsb(L).
The second hypothesis says that arguments supporting the
