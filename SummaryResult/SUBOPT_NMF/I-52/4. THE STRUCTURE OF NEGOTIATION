Consequently, the set of acceptable offers, Oa is empty as well. 
Then the preferred extensions of A, Def are pairwise disjoint w.r.t arguments of AO.
Let A be a set of arguments, R the  attacking relation of A defined as R ⊆ A × A, and an acyclic relation on A.
Definition 9 (Acyclic relation).
If the relation on A is acyclic, then each extension Ei of <A, Def>, |Ei| = 1.
Theorem 5.
Then the set of accepted arguments w.r.t A, Def is emtpy.
Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A.
