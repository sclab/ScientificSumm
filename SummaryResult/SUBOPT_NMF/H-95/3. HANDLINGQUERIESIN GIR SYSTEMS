The algorithm also handles query strings where more than one geographical reference is provided, using and or an equivalent preposition, together with a recursive call to Algorithm 2.
If the algorithm succeeds in finding valid relation and where terms, then the corresponding triple is returned.
The relation term is matched against a list of possible values (e.g.
It uses Algorithm 1 to find the where term, disambiguating it into a set of ontology concepts.
Although they do not contain an explicit place reference, we expect results to be about hotels in Seattle.
