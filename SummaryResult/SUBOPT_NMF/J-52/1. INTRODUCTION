First, we show that it is possible to design contracts to induce cooperation when intermediate nodes can choose to forward or drop packets, as well as when the nodes can choose to forward packets with different levels of quality of service.
If the path and transit costs are known prior to  transmission, the principal achieves first best solution, and can implement the contracts either directly with each intermediate node or  recursively through the network (each node making a contract with the following node) without any loss in utility.
The endpoints can provide incentives , e.g. , in the form of
