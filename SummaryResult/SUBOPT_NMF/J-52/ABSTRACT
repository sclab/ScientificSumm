We further demonstrate that per-hop monitoring does not necessarily improve the utility of the principal or the social welfare in the system.
Using a principal-agent model, we show how the hidden-action problem can be overcome through  appropriate design of contracts, in both the direct (the endpoints contract with each individual router) and recursive (each router contracts with the next  downstream router) cases.
In addition, we generalize existing mechanisms that deal with hidden-information to handle scenarios involving both hidden-information and hidden-action.
