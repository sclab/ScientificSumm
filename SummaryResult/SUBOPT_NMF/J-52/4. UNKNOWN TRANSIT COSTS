Let the payments of FPSS be: sB i = 0 sG i = pi (1 − k)n−i+1 Then, FPSS has a Nash equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal their transit costs and all nodes on the LCP forward packets.
PROPOSITION 4.1.
A node that drops a packet receives sB i = 0, which is smaller than or equal to E[u]i for i ∈ LCP and equals E[u]i for i /∈ LCP.
if bi > P r Ir ( b|i ∞ ) br − P r=i Ir ( b ) br , it will not be on the
