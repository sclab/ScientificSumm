In contrast, with the use of monitoring, the action chosen by node i is independent of the other agents"  forwarding behavior.
Under the monitoring mechanism, the principal has to satisfy the following constraints: (IC)Pr(xG i→i+1|ai = 1)sG + Pr(xB i→i+1|ai = 1)sB − c ≥ Pr(xG i→i+1|ai = 0)sG + Pr(xB i→i+1|ai = 0)sB (9) (IR)Pr(xG S→i|aj<i = 1)(Pr(xG i→i+1|ai = 1)sG + Pr(xB i→i+1|ai = 1)sB − c) ≥ 0 (10) 3For a recent proposal of an accountability framework that provides such monitoring information see [4].
Because the expected benefit when
