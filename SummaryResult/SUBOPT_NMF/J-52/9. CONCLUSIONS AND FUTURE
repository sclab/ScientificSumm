• Analyze the feasibility of recursive contracts under  hiddeninformation of transit costs.
Our preliminary results show that when several senders compete for a single transit node"s  capacity, the sender with the highest demand pays a premium even if transit costs are common knowledge.
• While the proposed payment schemes sustain cooperation in equilibrium, it is not a unique equilibrium.
The premium can be expressed as a function of the second-highest demand.
Our model and results suggest several natural and intriguing  research avenues: • Consider manipulative or collusive behaviors which may arise under the proposed payment schemes.
We plan
