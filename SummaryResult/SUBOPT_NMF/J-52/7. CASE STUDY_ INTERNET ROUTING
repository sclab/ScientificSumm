One approach to obtain such information is through end-to-end  probing [1].
However, as we have shown in Section 5, as long as each agent can chose the next hop, the principal can gain full benefit by  contracting with only the first hop (through the implementation of recursive contracts).
However, the various proposals for acquiring network topology and performance information do not deal with strategic behavior by the intermediate nodes.
Recently , several new architectures have been proposed in the context of the Internet to provide the principal not only with a set of paths from which it can chose (
