In Section 6, we show that the model applies to scenarios in which agents choose between different levels of quality of service.
We show that our model can be applied to both scenarios with known and  unknown topologies and costs, and highlight the implications of each scenario in the context of contracts.
We denote the action choice of agent i by ai âˆˆ {0, 1}, where ai = 0 and ai = 1 stand for the low-effort and high-effort actions, respectively.
Each action is associated with a cost ( to the agent ) C ( ai ) , and we assume :
