Since the error in this sum is e(σX ), the actual values of a and b lie in the interval a ± e(σX ) and b ± e(σX ) respectively.

Hence , the error in Equation 2 is either the probability that the sum lies between the limits a − e ( σX ) and a ( i.e. , the area under the curve defined by N ( Xμ , ν X ) between a − e ( σX ) and a , which is the shaded region A in Figure
