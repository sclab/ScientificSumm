Irrespective of the actual probability distribution function, let μ be the mean weight for the population of players and ν the variance in the players" weights.
The players" weights in this population are defined by a probability distribution function.
We use this rule to determine the Shapley value as follows.
Evaluate expected marginal contribution (ΔX i ) of player i to SX as: ΔX i ← 1√ (2πν/X) R b a e−X (x−Xμ)2 2ν dx 2.3.
The marginal contribution of player i to this random sample is one if the total weight of the X players in the
