Finally, [9, 10] present a  polynomial time method for finding the Shapley value.
Furthermore, the method can be used only if the game is represented in a specific form (viz., the multi-issue representation), not otherwise.
In [12], however, the question remains how to get the number of swings from the definition of a voting game and what is the time  complexity of doing this.
In [12], for instance, the Shapley value is computed by considering a random sample from a large population of players.
This method gives the exact Shapley value, but its time  complexity is exponential.
This method can
