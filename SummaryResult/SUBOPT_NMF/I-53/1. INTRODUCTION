However, the voting game has practical relevance to multi-agent systems as it is an important means of reaching consensus between multiple agents.
In other words, it is practically infeasible to try to compute the exact Shapley value.
For the computationally complex voting games, we present a new randomised method, along the lines of Monte-Carlo simulation, for computing the approximate Shapley value.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique and fair (see Section 2.1 for a discussion of the property of fairness).
Specifically , it is the difference between the true
