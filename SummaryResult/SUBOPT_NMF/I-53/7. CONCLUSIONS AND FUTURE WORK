In particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game is #P-complete.
By doing so, we have shown when it is  computationally feasible to find the exact Shapley value.
Our experiments show that the percentage error in the Shapley value is at most 20.
However, its main problem is that, for many coalition games, the Shapley value cannot be determined in polynomial time.
Although this problem is, in general #P-complete, we show that there are some specific voting games for which the Shapley value can be determined in polynomial time and  characterise such games.
