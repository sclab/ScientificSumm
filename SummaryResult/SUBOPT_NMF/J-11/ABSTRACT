We model this phenomenon using a game in which buyers,  sellers, and traders engage in trade on a graph that represents the access each buyer and seller has to the traders.
We show that the resulting game always has a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, and that all equilibria lead to an efficient (i.e.
Typically, not all buyers and sellers have access to the same intermediaries, and they trade at correspondingly different prices that reflect their relative amounts of power in the market.
We extend these results to a more general type of matching market ,
