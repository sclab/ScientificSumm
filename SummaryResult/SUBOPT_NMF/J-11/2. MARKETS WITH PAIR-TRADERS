A  deviation for t would involve offering a lower ask to seller i and a higher bid to seller j than their current trade.
Note that a seller or buyer i connected to a single trader t cannot have profit at equilibrium, so possible equilibrium profits are in one-to-one correspondence with dual solutions for which pi = 0 whenever i is monopolized by one trader.
We want to make sure that pi = 0 for all sellers and buyers that have degree at most 1 in E. Consider a seller i that has pi > 0.
