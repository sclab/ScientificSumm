This multicast transport level solution is geared to the single writer semantics of web objects.
In contrast, BuddyCache uses application level multicast and a sender-reliable  coherence protocol to provide similar access latency  improvements for transactional objects.
Anderson, Eastham and Vahdat in WebFS [29] present a global file system coherence protocol that allows clients to choose 27 on per file basis between receiving updates or invalidations.
Cooperative Web caching techniques, (e.g.
Cheriton and Li propose MMO [ 12 ] a hybrid web coherence protocol that combines invalidations with updates using multicast delivery channels and receiver-reliable protocol , exploiting locality in a
