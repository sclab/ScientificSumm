BuddyCache is a new transactional caching approach that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for collaborative strong-consistency applications in  high-latency network environments.
The challenge is to improve performance while providing the correctness and availability properties of a transactional caching protocol in the presence of node failures and slow peers.
We have implemented a BuddyCache prototype and  evaluated its performance.
Analytical results, confirmed by measurements of the BuddyCache prototype using the  multiuser 007 benchmark indicate that for typical Internet  latencies, e.g.
ranging from 40 to 80 milliseconds round trip time to the storage server , peers using BuddyCache
