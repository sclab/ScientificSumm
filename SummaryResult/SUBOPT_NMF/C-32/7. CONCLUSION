We have designed and implemented BuddyCache  prototype in Thor distributed transactional object storage  system [23] and evaluated the benefits and costs of the system over a range of network latencies.
This paper described BuddyCache, a new transactional  cooperative caching [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] technique that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for  collaborative strong-consistency applications in high-latency  network environments.
Analytical results,  supported by the system measurements using the multi-user 007 benchmark indicate, that for typical Internet latencies  BuddyCache provides significant performance benefits, e.g.
The technique improves performance yet provides strong correctness and availability properties in the
