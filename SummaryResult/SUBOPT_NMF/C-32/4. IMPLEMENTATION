When a client request has to be processed at the servers, e.g., a complete requested page is unavailable in the peer group or a peer needs to commit a transaction, the redirector acts as a server proxy: it forwards the request to the server, and then forwards the reply back to the client.
In addition, in response to invalidations sent by a server, the redirector distributes the update or invalidation information to clients caching the modified page and, after all clients acknowledge, propagates the group acknowledgment back to the server (see figure 3).
