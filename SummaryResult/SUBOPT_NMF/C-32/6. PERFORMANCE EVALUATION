In peer fetch, the cost of the redirection includes, in addition to the local network request cost, the CPU processing latency of crossing the redirector and crossing the helper, the latter including the time to process the help request and the time to copy, and unswizzle the requested page.
To evaluate the overheads of the peer fetch, we measure the peer fetch latency (PeerFetch) at the requesting client and break down its component costs.
We evaluate this latency overhead indirectly by comparing the measured latency of the Buddy system server fetch or commit request with the measured latency of the
