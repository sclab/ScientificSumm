To improve access latency, clients fetch objects from repository servers and cache and access them locally.
Interaction with the server  increases latency.
The performance problem facing the collaborative application is coordinating with the servers consistent access to shared objects.
A  redirector server, interposed between the clients and the remote servers, runs on the same network as the collaborating group and, when possible, replaces the function of the remote servers.
Collaborative applications seem a particularly good match to benefit from this approach since one of the hard problems , namely determining what objects are cached where , becomes easy in small
