We propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists, which outperforms previous methods.
We explore the impact of different approaches, such as static vs. dynamic caching, and caching query results vs. caching posting lists.
Using a query log spanning a whole year we explore the  limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching posting lists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query  answers.
Finally, we measure how the changes in the query log affect the  effectiveness of static caching, given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time.
We also study the problem
