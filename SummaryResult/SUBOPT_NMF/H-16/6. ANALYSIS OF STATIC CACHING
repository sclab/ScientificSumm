Table 2: Ratios between the average time to  evaluate a query and the average time to return cached answers (centralized and distributed case).
T is measured by processing the same 100,000 queries (the first 10,000 queries are used to warm-up the system).
Therefore, the volume Vc(n), which is the total number of the n most frequent queries, is Vc(n) = V0 n i=1 Q iα = γnQ (0 < γn < 1).
The posting lists in the inverted file consist of pairs of  document identifier and term frequency.
We perform both full and partial evaluation of answers , because some queries are
