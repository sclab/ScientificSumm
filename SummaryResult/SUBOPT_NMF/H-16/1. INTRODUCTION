On the other hand, previously unseen queries occur more often than previously unseen terms,  implying a higher miss rate for cached answers.
Often the whole set of  posting lists does not fit in memory, and consequently, the engine has to select a small set to keep in memory and speed up query processing.
Finally, before deciding to adopt a static caching policy the query stream should be analyzed to verify that its  characteristics do not change rapidly over time.
More concretely , our main conclusions are that : â€¢ Caching query answers results in lower hit ratios compared to caching
