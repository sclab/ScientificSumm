The first strategy we consider is the algorithm proposed by Baeza-Yates and Saint-Jean [2], which consists in selecting the posting lists of the terms with the highest query-term frequencies fq(t).
In fact, the problem of selecting the best posting lists for the static cache corresponds to the  standard Knapsack problem: given a knapsack of fixed  capacity, and a set of n items, such as the i-th item has value ci and size si, select the set of items that fit in the knapsack and maximize the overall value.
