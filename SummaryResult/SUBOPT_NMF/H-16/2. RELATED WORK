follow Markatos" work by showing that combining static and dynamic caching policies together with an adaptive prefetching policy achieves a high hit ratio [7].
Their goal for such systems has been to improve response time for hierarchical engines.
Although these approaches seek to improve query processing efficiency, they differ from our  current work in that they do not consider caching.
Finally, our static caching algorithm for posting lists in Section 5 uses the ratio frequency/size in order to evaluate the goodness of an item to cache.
As systems are often hierarchical , there has also been some effort on
