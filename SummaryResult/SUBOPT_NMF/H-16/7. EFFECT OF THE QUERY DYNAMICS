After a small decay in hit rate values, the hit rate stabilizes between 0.28, and 0.34 for the entire week, suggesting that the static cache is effective for a whole week after the training period.
To simulate a realistic scenario, we use the first 6 (3) weeks of the query stream for computing query term frequencies and the following 9 (12) weeks to estimate the hit rate.
This hit rate is as an upper bound, and it assumes perfect knowledge of the query term frequencies.
We observe that the hit rate reaches its highest value during the night ( around
