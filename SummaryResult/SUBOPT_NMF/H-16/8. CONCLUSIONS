Caching terms is more effective with respect to miss rate, achieving values as low as 12%.
Dynamic caching of queries has limited effectiveness due to the high number of compulsory misses caused by the number of unique or infrequent queries.
Our results show that in our UK log, the minimum miss rate is 50% using a working set strategy.
We also propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists that  outperforms previous static caching algorithms as well as dynamic algorithms such as LRU and LFU, obtaining hit rate values that are over 10% higher compared these strategies.
We
