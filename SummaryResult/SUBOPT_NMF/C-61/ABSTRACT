We show that such division of  authority leads to a smoother game playing experience by  implementing this mechanism in a massively multi-player online game called RPGQuest.
In addition, we argue that cheat detection techniques can be easily implemented at the  communication proxies if they are made aware of the game-play mechanics.
Using this architecture, we propose an authority assignment mechanism that divides the  authority for deciding the outcome of different actions/events that occur within the game between client and servers on a per action/event basis.
Unlike proxy-based architectures that have been proposed in the literature where the proxies replicate all
