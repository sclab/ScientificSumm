We further propose to make the proxies in our architecture more game cognizant so that cheat detection mechanisms can be built into the proxies themselves. 
In this paper, we first proposed a proxy-based  architecture for MMOGs that enables MMOGs to scale to a large number of users by mitigating the need for a large  number of transport sessions to be maintained and decreasing both bandwidth overhead and latency of event update.
Software such as Punkbuster [ 22 ] and a reputation system like those proposed by [ 23 ] and [ 15 ] would be integral to the operation of
