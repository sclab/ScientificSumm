The main goal of this work is to improve scalability of First-Person Shooter (FPS) and RPG games.
It is mentioned in this work that dividing the game space among multiple games servers such as the federated model presented in [19] is inefficient for a relatively fast game flow and that the proposed architecture alleviates this problem because users do not have to connect to a different server whenever they cross the server boundary.
Our work differs from the above discussed previous works by proposing a ) a distributed proxy-based architecture to decrease bandwidth requirements at the clients and the servers
