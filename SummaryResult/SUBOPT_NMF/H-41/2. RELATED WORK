For  example, Borodin et al.
Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.
Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough  studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their  effectiveness have been published.
Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.
[ 1 ] employed quantitative measures , but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and
