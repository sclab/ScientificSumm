a link-selection predicate P and a sampling value s is defined to be: IP s = [ v∈R Ss[{u ∈ V : (u, v) ∈ E ∧ P(u, v)}] The base set BP s of the root set R w.r.t.
The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit  integers.
Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.
