The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the  highestranking T documents is relevant.
The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e.
Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.
This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.
Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.
The reciprocal rank ( RR ) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to
