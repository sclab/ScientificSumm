In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.
Therefore, we chose to  approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms  comprising Q.
Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.
Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.
We tuned the weights by selecting
