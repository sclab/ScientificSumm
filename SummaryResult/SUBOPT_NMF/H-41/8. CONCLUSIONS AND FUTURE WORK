Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA.
HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.
Finally, we are planning to experiment with more complex feature combinations. 
Evaluating link-based features in isolation, we found that web page in-degree  outperforms PageRank, and is about as effwective as HITS  authority scores.
In particular , we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness , the impact of various schemes meant to counteract
