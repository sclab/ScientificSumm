Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.
Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.
This  continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.
The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search ; to some degree , one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent : it tries to measure the interest of
