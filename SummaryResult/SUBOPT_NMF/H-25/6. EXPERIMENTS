We adopt the Simplified KL Divergence metric used in [24] to decide query expansion terms as our term relevance  measure: σKLD(w) = p(w|R) log p(w|R) p(w|¬R) where p(w|R) is the probability that a relevant document contains term w, and p(w|¬R) is the probability that an irrelevant document contains w, both of which can be easily computed via maximum likelihood estimate given document-level relevance judgment.
Other times a dubious term may be included but turns out to be irrelevant.
To  answer these questions, we need a measure of individual terms" true relevance.
Therefore , we
