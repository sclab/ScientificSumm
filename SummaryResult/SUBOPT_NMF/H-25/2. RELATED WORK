For  example, the study in [12] shows that the user prefers to have explicit knowledge and direct control of which terms are used for query  expansion, and the penetrable interface that provides this freedom is shown to perform better than other interfaces.
Our work differs from the previous ones in two important  aspects.
For example, in some relevance feedback systems such as [12], there is an interaction step that allows the user to add or  remove expansion terms after they are automatically extracted from relevant documents.
Second , with the language modelling framework , we allow an elaborate construction of
