Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 
Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback.
They are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top.
We propose a cluster-based method for  selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback.
With term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without interaction with feedback documents , taking full control
