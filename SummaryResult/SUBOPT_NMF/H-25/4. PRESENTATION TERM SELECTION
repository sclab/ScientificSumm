Specifically, we assume the N documents contain K clusters {Ci| i = 1, 2, · · · K}, each characterized by a multinomial word distribution (also known as unigram language model) θi and corresponding to an aspect of the topic.
We rely on the mixture multinomial model, which is used for theme discovery in [26].
First, a lot of common noisy terms will be selected due to their high frequencies in the document collection, unless a stop-word list is used for filtering.
We could ask the user for finer judgment ( e.g. , choosing from highly relevant , somewhat relevant ,
