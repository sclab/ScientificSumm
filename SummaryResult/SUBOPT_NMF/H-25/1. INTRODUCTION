We identified two key subtasks of term-based feedback, i.e., pre-feedback  presentation term selection and post-feedback query model  construction, with effective algorithms developed for both.
Third, sometimes there are no relevant documents in the top N of the initially retrieved results if the topic is hard.
First, the user has better  control of the final query model through direct manipulation of terms: he/she can dictate which terms are relevant, irrelevant, and  possibly, to what degree.
Finally, by comparing term feedback with document-level feedback, we found it to be a viable alternative to the latter with competitive retrieval performance.
It has the
