If we are able to identify the relevant clusters, we can combine them to generate a query model that is good at discovering documents belonging to these clusters (instead of the irrelevant ones).
We could ask the user to directly judge the  relevance of a cluster after viewing representative terms in that cluster, but this would sometimes be a difficult task for the user, who has to guess the semantics of a cluster via its set of terms, which may not be well connected to one another due to a lack of context.
