As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.
In order to maximally  benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.
Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).
Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.
Unfortunately , in real world applications , users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to
