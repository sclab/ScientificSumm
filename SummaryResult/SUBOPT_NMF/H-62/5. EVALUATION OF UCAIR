We use query topics from TREC 2 2004 Terabyte track [2] and TREC 2003 Web track [4] topic distillation task in the way to be described below.
For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the  normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.

We also evaluate precisions at different recall levels.
Scatter plots of precision at top 10 and top 20 documents are shown
