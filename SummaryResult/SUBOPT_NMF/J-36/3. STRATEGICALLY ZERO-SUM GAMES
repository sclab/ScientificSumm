A game A, u is strategically zero sum if there exist labels (i, ai) for every Player i and every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai 152 such that, for all mixed-strategy profiles α, we have that the sum of the utilities satisfies ui(α)+uii(α) = X ai∈Ai αi(ai)· (i, ai)+ X aii∈Aii αii(aii)· (ii, aii).
Note that any constant-sum game is strategically zero sum as well.
Then the following are equivalent : ( i ) G is strategically zero sum ; ( ii ) there exist labels ( i , ai ) for every player
