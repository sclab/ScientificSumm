However, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.
With this  modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of Bergemann and V¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.
Another interesting setting for Socratic games is when the set Q of available queries is given by Q = P(Γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ P(Γ) of queries from a specified groundset Γ of queries.
Special cases of adaptive Socratic games are closely
