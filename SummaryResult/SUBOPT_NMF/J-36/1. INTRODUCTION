A real world is  cho150 sen randomly from a set of possible worlds according to a common prior distribution.
(In traditional games of incomplete and imperfect information, there is information that the players do not have; in Socratic games, unlike in these games, the players have a chance to acquire the missing information, at some cost.)
Our techniques also yield Nash equilibria in unobservable-query Socratic games with strategically zero-sum worlds.
Our research was initially inspired by recent results in psychology on decision making , but it soon became clear that Socratic game theory is also a general tool for understanding
