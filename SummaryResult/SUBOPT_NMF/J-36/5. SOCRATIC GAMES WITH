Define an unobservable-query  Socratic game G∗ with one possible world for each t ∈ T, one available zero-cost query qi for each Player i so that qi  reveals ti, and all else as in G. Bayesian Nash equilibria in G correspond directly to Nash equilibria in G∗ , and the worlds of G∗ are strategically zero sum.
Because each world of G is constant sum, Lemma 5.2 implies that the induced Stage-2 games Gstage2(q) are all Bayesian constant sum.
Let G = A, T, r, u be a strategically zero-sum Bayesian game.
Therefore , by Lemma 5.1 , we can assemble
