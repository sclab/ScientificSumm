When Player i receives signal qi(wreal) in response to query qi, he or she can infer that wreal ∈ {w : qi(w) = qi(wreal)}, i.e., the set of possible worlds from which query qi cannot distinguish wreal.
When Player i makes query qi : W → S, he or she receives the signal qi(wreal).
When queries are observable, each player learns which query was made by the other player, and the results of his or her own query-that is, each Player i learns qi, qii, and qi(wreal).
In the Socratic game , a pure strategy for Player
