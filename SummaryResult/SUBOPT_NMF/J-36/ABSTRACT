Players can make queries, at some cost, to learn partial information about which of the possible worlds is the actual world, before choosing an action.
The results in this paper consider cases in which the  underlying worlds of a two-player Socratic game are either constant-sum games or strategically zero-sum games, a class that generalizes constant-sum games to include all games in which the sum of payoffs depends linearly on the interaction between the players.
In a Socratic game, players begin with an a priori probability distribution over many possible worlds, with a different utility function for each world.
