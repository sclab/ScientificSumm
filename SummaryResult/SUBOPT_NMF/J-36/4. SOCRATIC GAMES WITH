An efficient, correct separation oracle allows us to solve the LP efficiently via the ellipsoid method.
We now give an efficient separation oracle for the LP in Figure 1, thus allowing the ellipsoid method to solve the LP in polynomial time.
Next, suppose xi ai,qi,w, yi qi , œÅi is feasible for the LP.
More specifically , given fii and the result qi ( wreal ) of the query qi , it is straightforward to compute the probability that , conditioned on the fact that the result of query qi is qi ( w ) , the world is
