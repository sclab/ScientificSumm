YaCy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application.
The index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed.

The distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates Apocrita goals.

Apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a DHT.
YaCy consists of a web crawler , an indexer , a built-in database engine
