The difference in going from one indexing node to two indexing nodes is the most drastic and equates to an indexing time 37% faster than a single indexing node.
Java sockets vs. JXTA sockets.
The minimum transfer rate obtained using Java sockets is 81,945KB/s while the minimum transfer rater obtained using JXTA sockets is much lower at 3, 805KB/s.
Node vs. index time.
As Figure 5 demonstrates, the performance of JXTA sockets is abysmal as compared to the performance of standard Java sockets.
The different between two 177 indexing nodes and three indexing nodes is still significant and represents a
