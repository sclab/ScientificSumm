Centralized algorithm Figure 5: Experimental results In a second step, the average complexity of the algorithm has been determined by experiments.
So each steps has a l × (l − 1) cost.
This gap comes from the local decision making in each agent.
The algorithm is then more  efficient on average than the centralized algorithm, and its average complexity is below the worst case.
The ontologist can make modifications and the hierarchy adapts depending on the request.
The second `` for '' loop is ran l times for i ranging from 1 to l. Then its cost is Pl i=1
