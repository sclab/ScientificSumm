figure 1): • a term network, obtained thanks to a term extraction tool used to preprocess the textual corpus, • a multi-agent system which uses the term network to make a hierarchical clustering in order to obtain a taxonomy of  concepts, • an interface allowing the ontologist to visualize and control the clustering process.
In particular, it creates a "Head-Expansion" network which has already proven to be interesting for a clustering system [1].
For example, "knowledge engineering from text" has "knowledge engineering" as head term and "text" as  expansion term.
It uses
