From the point of view of ontology building, this work is a first step showing the relevance of our approach.
Also from the multi-agent engineering point of view, their use in a dynamic ontology context has shown its relevance.
This  dynamic ontologies can be seen as complex problem solving, in such a case self-organization through cooperation has been an efficient solution.
Our system makes use of a terminological network  resulting from an analysis made by Syntex.
It must continue, both to ensure a better robustness during classification, and to obtain richer structures semantic wise than simple trees.
