An ontologist is a kind of cognitive engineer, or analyst, who is using information from texts and expert interviews to design ontologies.
Most works  interested in the construction of ontologies [7] propose the refinement of ontologies.
Researchers, working on the construction of ontologies from texts, claim that the work to be automated requires external resources such as a dictionary [14], or web access [5].
It would mean creating dynamic ontologies [10] and it justifies the emergence of ontology learning techniques [14] [13].
We propose a semi-automated tool since an external resource is required: the "ontologist".
This process consists
