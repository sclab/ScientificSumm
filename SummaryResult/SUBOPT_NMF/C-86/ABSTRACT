While market-based systems have long been proposed as  solutions for distributed resource allocation, few have been deployed for production use in real computer systems.
Towards this end, we present our initial experience using  Mirage, a microeconomic resource allocation system based on a repeated combinatorial auction.
Mirage allocates time on a heavily-used 148-node wireless sensor network testbed.
In particular, we focus on observed strategic user behavior over a four-month period in which 312,148 node hours were  allocated across 11 research projects.
Based on these results , we present a set of key challenges for market-based resource allocation systems based on repeated
