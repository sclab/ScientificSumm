In this paper, we report briefly on our first goal while focusing primarily on the second.
Empirical results based on four months of usage have  validated the key motivating factors in using an auction-based scheme (i.e., significant resource contention and widely  varying valuations) but have also pointed to real-world  observations of strategic user behavior.
The key contribution of this paper is an analysis of such strategic behavior as observed over a four-month time period and proposed refinements for mitigating such  behavior en route to building an approximately strategyproof  repeated combinatorial auction.
An economic problem only exists when resources are scarce
