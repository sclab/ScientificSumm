The average time cost to reach agreement is 8.4.
Experiment 2 : A and B also negotiate with each other for 50 times in this experiment given different values of dA, dB, repA, repB (satisfying −50 ≤ ∆d = dA − dB ≤ 50 and −50 ≤ ∆rep = drep −drep ≤ 50) and the reserved utilities of A and B.
There are 6 negotiation games  terminated forcibly.
When one provider is obviously more appropriate than the other provider, the provider will get the right to provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds.
When dA−dB 500 approximates to dA−dB 1000
