Judd and Steenkiste in [5] describe a generic interface to query context services  allowing clients to specify their quality requirements as bounds on accuracy, confidence, update time and sample interval.
They characterize various types and sources of imperfect context information and present a set of novel context modelling constructs.
Most approaches to provide appropriate context utilize a centralized arbitrator.
In [6], Lei et al.
Our approach can reduce the burden of the middleware, because we do not need the  middleware to provide a context selection mechanism.
They also outline a software infrastructure that supports the management and use of imperfect
