The dependence between two queries is reflected by the SI(q, q ) score, where scores greater than zero indicate that it is likely that there is a dependence, which we take to mean that the queries are likely to be similar: SI(q, q ) = log p(q, q ) p(q)p(q ) (10) We estimate the probability of a topic p(q) using the number of documents relevant to query q within the collection.
Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI, [17]) is a measure of  association used in information theory to determine the extent of  independence between variables.
