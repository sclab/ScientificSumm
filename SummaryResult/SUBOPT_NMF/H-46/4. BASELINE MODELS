, qm) = p(t, q1, .
This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19].
, qm) = P t âˆˆT p(t , q1, .
We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, .
Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3.
In [4], two methods are presented for  estimating this probability, based on the number of person names  recognized in a document.
With the document models forming U, the joint  probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, .
Here , the process is broken into
