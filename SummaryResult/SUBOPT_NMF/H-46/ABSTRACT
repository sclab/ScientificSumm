Using this test set, we conduct two series of experiments.
The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline  expertise retrieval methods applied to the new test set.
For our experimental evaluation, we introduce (and release) a new test set based on a crawl of a  university site.
We first present two main  expertise retrieval tasks, along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people.
Expertise retrieval models are shown to be robust with respect to environments smaller than the W3C collection , and current techniques appear
