Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the  expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes" Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the  probability of a query.
Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, .
A topical profile of a candidate , then , is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate ca '' s expertise
