For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is  representative of the type of intranet that we described above.
Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.
This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.
Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly  improve retrieval performance.
In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean , multilingual data are available
