More specifically, we assessed the performance of the system in terms of delivery ratio and average delay, varying the  density of population and the buffer size, and using persistent and non-persistent messages with different priorities.
Moreover, the epidemic algorithms are able to  guarantee a high delivery ratio if one evaluates performance over a time interval sufficient for the dissemination of the replicas of messages (i.e., the infection spreading) in a large portion of the ad-hoc network.
The simulation results show that the EMMA '' s performance , in terms of delivery ratio and delay of persistent messages with higher priorities
