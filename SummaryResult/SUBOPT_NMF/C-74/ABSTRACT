Message oriented middleware for traditional systems has been developed and used to provide an asynchronous paradigm of communication for distributed systems, and, recently, also for some specific mobile computing systems.
In this paper, we present our experience in designing, implementing and evaluating EMMA (Epidemic Messaging Middleware for ad-hoc networks), an adaptation of Java Message Service (JMS) for mobile ad-hoc environments.
We discuss in detail the design challenges and some possible  solutions, showing a concrete example of the feasibility and suitability of the application of the asynchronous paradigm in this setting and outlining a research roadmap for the  coming years.
