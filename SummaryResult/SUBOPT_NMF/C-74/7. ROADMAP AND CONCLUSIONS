We have also shown a proof of concept adaptation of JMS to the extreme scenario of partially connected mobile ad-hoc networks.
We have described and discussed the characteristics and differences of our solution with respect to traditional JMS implementations and the existing adaptations for mobile  settings.
However, trade-offs between application-level routing and resource usage should also be investigated, as mobile devices are commonly power/resource scarce.
A key limitation of this work is the poorly performing epidemic algorithm and an important advance in the practicability of this work requires an algorithm that better balances the needs of efficiency and message delivery
