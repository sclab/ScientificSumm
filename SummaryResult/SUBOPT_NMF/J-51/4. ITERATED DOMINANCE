For every variable v ∈ V , the row player has strategies s+v, s−v, s1 v, s2 v, s3 v, s4 v, and the column player has strategies t1 v, t2 v, t3 v, t4 v. For every clause c ∈ C, the row player has a strategy sc, and the column player has a strategy tc, as well as, for every literal l occurring in c, an additional strategy tl c. The row player has two additional strategies s1 and s2.
To show that the problem is NP-hard , we reduce an arbitrary satisfiability instance ( given by a nonempty
