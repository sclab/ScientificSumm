Both of these results hold both with and without dominance by mixed strategies.
Iterated strict dominance, on the other hand, is path-independent (both with and without dominance by mixed strategies) and can therefore be done in polynomial time.
Finally, we show that iterated dominance  using pure strategies can require an exponential number of iterations in a Bayesian game (both with strict and weak dominance).
(A weaker version of the second result (only without dominance by mixed strategies) was already known [7].)
First , we show that finding the dominating strategy with minimum support size is NP-complete ( both for strict
