Both of these results hold both with and without dominance by mixed strategies.
(A weaker version of the second result (only without dominance by mixed strategies) was already known [7].)
Finally, we studied dominance and iterated dominance in Bayesian games, as an example of a concise representation language for normal form games that is interesting in its own right.
There are various avenues for future research.
We showed that  determining whether there is some path that eliminates a given  strategy is NP-complete with iterated weak dominance.
Iterated strict dominance , on the other hand , is path-independent ( both with
