The idea is that dominated strategies can be eliminated from consideration.
In this paper, we study some fundamental computational questions concerning dominance and iterated dominance,  including how hard it is to check whether a given strategy can be eliminated by each of the variants of these notions.
The problem of computing solutions according to the  perhaps more elementary solution concepts of dominance and iterated dominance has received much less attention.
In iterated dominance , the elimination proceeds in rounds , and becomes easier as more strategies are eliminated : in any given round , the dominating strategy no longer needs
