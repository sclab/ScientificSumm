For strict dominance, the question is whether the pdr can be set so that for every pure strategy for the column player σc ∈ Σc, dr∈Dr pdr ur(dr, σc) > ur(σ∗ r , σc).
Proposition 1.
For weak dominance, we can solve the following linear program: maximize σc∈Σc (( dr∈Dr pdr ur(dr, σc)) − ur(σ∗ r , σc)) such that for any σc ∈ Σc, dr∈Dr pdr ur(dr, σc) ≥ ur(σ∗ r , σc); dr∈Dr pdr = 1.
In this section, we study the notion of one-shot (not  iterated) dominance.
Because the inequality must be strict , we can not
