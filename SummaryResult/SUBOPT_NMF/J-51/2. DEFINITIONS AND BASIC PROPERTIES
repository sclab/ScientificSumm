We note that the process of iterated dominance is never helped by removing a dominated mixed strategy, for the following reason.
We are now ready to move on to the core of this paper.

When we are looking at the dominance relations for player i , the other players ( −i ) can be thought of as a single player.3 Therefore , in the rest of the paper , when we study one-shot ( not iterated ) dominance
