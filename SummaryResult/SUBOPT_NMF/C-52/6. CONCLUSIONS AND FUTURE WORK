We then presented an algorithm based on scheduling the DR vectors to be sent to different players at different times thereby equalizing the error at different players.
This algorithm is aimed at making the game fair to all players, but tends to increase the mean error of the players.
In this paper, we first developed a model for estimating the error in rendering player trajectories at the  receivers.
There is unfair advantage gained by receivers who are closer to the sender of the DR as they are able to render the sender '' s position more accurately in real time
