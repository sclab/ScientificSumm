We refer to this error as the export error.
In addition, the budget based algorithm is shown to achieve the same level of accuracy of game playing as the current implementation of BZflag using much less number of DR vectors. 
Through an implementation of this algorithm using the open source game BZflag, we show that this algorithm makes the game very fair (we measure fairness in terms of the standard deviation of the  error).
In an earlier paper [ 1 ] , we showed that by synchronizing the clocks at all the players and by using a technique based on
