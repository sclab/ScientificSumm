This flip-flop effect leads to the increase in the accumulated error for all the receivers.
Using the same amount of DR vectors over time as in the base case, instead of sending the DR vectors to all the receivers at the same frequency as in the base case, if we can increase the frequency of sending the DR vectors to the receiver with higher accumulated error and decrease the frequency of sending DR vectors to the receiver with lower accumulated error, we can equalize the export error of all receivers over time.
