But these works [7, 8] assume the existence of a global view of the game where a game server maintains a view (or state) of the game.
For  example, a receiver could skew the delay estimate at the sender to make the sender believe that the delay between the sender and the receiver is high thereby gaining undue advantage.
In the next section , we describe the game model that we use and illustrate how senders and receivers exchange DR vectors and how entities are rendered at the receivers based on the time-stamp augmented DR vector exchange as described in
