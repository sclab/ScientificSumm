In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors to exchange movement information among players, there is  inaccuracy in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between the sender and the receiver.
In this paper, we first introduce an error  measure for estimating this inaccuracy.
The object is placed at the  receiver at the position indicated by the dead-reckoning vector, but by that time, the real position could have changed considerably at the sender.
Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make this error equal at
