Assume that DR0 is received at the receiver after a delay of dt0 time units.
The horizontal axis shows the time which is synchronized among all the players.
When this DR vector is received, assume that the entity is at point D. A new position for the entity is computed as (x1 + vx1 × dt1, y1 + vy0 × dt1) and the entity is moved to this position (point C).
This trajectory is followed until a new DR vector is received which changes the position and/or velocity of the entity.
This means , although the exported path based on DR1 at
