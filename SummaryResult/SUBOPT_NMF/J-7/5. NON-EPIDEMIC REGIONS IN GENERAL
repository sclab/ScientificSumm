Specifically, let q = 1 2 − 1 64Δ and c = rΔ = α, where α is any irrational number strictly between 3/64 and q.
There exist q < 1/2 and r such that for every contagion game (G, q, r), A cannot become epidemic.
This change will be  negative so long as zA > c/q which holds by inequality 1 as q > (1−q) for q > 1/2.
Recalling that q < 1/2 , we see u '' s payoff with strategy B is q ( zAB + zB ) whereas his payoff with strategy AB is ( 1 − q ) ( zAB
