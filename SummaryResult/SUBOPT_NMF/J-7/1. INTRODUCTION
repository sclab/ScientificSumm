Indeed, there exist graphs in which the contagion threshold is as large as 1 2 (including the infinite line - the unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than 1 2 .
In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible , we have a two-dimensional parameter space , so instead of a contagion threshold q∗ ( G ) we have an epidemic region Ω ( G ) , which is the subset of the ( q , r ) plane for which A can become epidemic
