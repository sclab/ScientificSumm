Consider a contagion game (G, q, r).
Let zA, zB, and zAB be the number of neighbors of vi with strategies A, B, and AB in the current state defined by S. Define zA,zB, and zAB similarly for S .
Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with  technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any  sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and the vertices in SB have strategy B.
