Finally, we  consider a compatibility parameter qBC that represents the payoffs to two adjacent nodes when one selects B and the other selects C. Thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ).
We will assume qA > qB > qC .
We will show that any blocking structure in G is also a blocking structure in G. By our characterization theorem,  Theorem 4.6, this implies the desired result.
The basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies B and C are initially coexisting , and a third technology A , superior to both
