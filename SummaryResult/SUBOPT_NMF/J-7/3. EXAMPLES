play their best response in this order, then A will become an epidemic.
Also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best response of an agent with her neighbors on one side playing A and neighbors on the other side playing B is the strategy AB.
Note they also exhibit non-convexities. 
Consider the decision faced by the agents in group 1, who have their right-hand neighbors using B and their left-hand neighbors using A.

We first discuss a natural Δ-regular generalization of the infinite line graph , and for this one
