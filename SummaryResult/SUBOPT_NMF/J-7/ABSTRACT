We characterize how the  ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these  parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range.
We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B , focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A , adopt B , or - at an extra cost -
