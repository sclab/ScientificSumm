For two states s and s and a vertex v ∈ V (G), if starting from state s and letting v play her best-response move (breaking ties in favor of A and then AB) we get to the state s , we write s v → s .
A state in this game is a strategy profile s : V (G) → {A, B, AB}.
In fact , we will show in Section 4 that if A can become an epidemic in a game , then for every schedule of best-response moves of the nodes in V ( G ) \ T in
