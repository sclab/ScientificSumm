Finally, if Vj0 is split in a way, that for some k, Vj0,ik = 0, it is the method mik that underestimates the opportunity cost of enabling method mj0 , and the similar reasoning applies.
However, heuristic H 1,0 leaves K âˆ’ 1 methods that  precede the method mj0 without any reward which leads to starvation.
So far , we have taken the same approach as in [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] in that the opportunity cost function Vj0 , ik that the method mik sends back to the method mj0 is a minimal , non-increasing function that dominates
