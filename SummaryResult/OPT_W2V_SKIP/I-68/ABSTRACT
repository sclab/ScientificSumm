Our experimental results demonstrate a  significant speedup of VFP over OC-DEC-MDP as well as higher solution qualities in a variety of situations.
In this paper, we improve a state-of-the-art heuristic solution method for DEC-MDPs, called OC-DEC-MDP, that has recently been shown to scale up to larger DEC-MDPs.
Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) are a  popular model of agent-coordination problems in domains with  uncertainty and time constraints but very difficult to solve.
We test both improvements  independently in a crisis-management domain as well as for other types of domains.
First , it speeds up OC-DECMDP by an order of magnitude by
