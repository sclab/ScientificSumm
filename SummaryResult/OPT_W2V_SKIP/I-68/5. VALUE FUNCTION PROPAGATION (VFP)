Probability Function, denoted as Pi(t), that maps time t ∈ [0, Δ] to the probability that method mi will be completed before time t. Such functional representation allows us to easily read the current policy, i.e., if an agent Ak is at method mi at time t, then it will wait as long as value function vi(t) will be greater in the future.
5.2 Reading the Policy In order to determine the policy of agent Ak for the method mj0 we must identify the set Zj0 of intervals [ z , z ] ⊂ [ 0 , ...
