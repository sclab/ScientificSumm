Since all sellers in this path are matched in ( ˆT−k )∗ , we have that seller k does not belong to P. Since in this case S1 = i and the rest of the sellers in P are matched in (T−i −j )∗ we have that seller i as well does not belong to P. This ensures that edges in P may be colored by alternating colors 3 and 4 (starting with 3).
Similarly since j is allocated Ai in ˆT∗ , we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an allocation of value U satisfying
