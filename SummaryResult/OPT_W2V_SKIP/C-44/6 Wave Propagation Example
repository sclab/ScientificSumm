Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave  propagation scenario.
However, we note that MSP is  conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.
So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the  context of straight-line scan.
In Figure 11 , if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line , which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and
