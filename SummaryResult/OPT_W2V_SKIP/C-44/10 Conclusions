We demonstrated that we could significantly improve localization accuracy by making full use of the information embedded in multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences.
We  proposed four novel optimization methods, exploiting order and marginal distribution among non-anchor nodes as well as the feedback information from early localization results.
In this paper, we present the first work that exploits the  concept of node sequence processing to localize sensor nodes.
We also evaluated  performance at scale through analysis as well as extensive  simulations.
The practical issues of partial node sequence and sequence flip were identified and addressed in two physical system test-beds.
