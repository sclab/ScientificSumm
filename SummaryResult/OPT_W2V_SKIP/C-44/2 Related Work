Although the received signal strength  indicator (RSSI) related [2, 24] methods were once considered an ideal low-cost solution, the irregularity of radio  propagation [26] seriously limits the accuracy of such systems.
The recently proposed RIPS localization system [11] superimposes two RF waves together, creating a low-frequency envelope that can be accurately measured.
In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be  precise in both time and space.
The main idea is to correlate the event detection time at a sensor node with the known space-time relationship of controlled events at the generator so that detection time-stamps can be mapped into
