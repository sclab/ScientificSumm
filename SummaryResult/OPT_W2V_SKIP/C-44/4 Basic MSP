To extend this process, suppose we have M anchor nodes and perform d scans from different angles, obtaining d node  sequences and dividing the area into many small parts.
Basic MSP only makes use of the order information  between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence.
Let us consider a sensor network with N target nodes and M anchor nodes randomly deployed in an area of size S. The top-level idea for basic MSP is to split the whole sensor  network area into small pieces by processing node sequences.
