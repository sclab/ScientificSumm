Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we compare sequence-based MSP with basic MSP under different number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.
For example, when the number of scans is 30, errors in sequence-based MSP are about 20% of that of basic MSP.
Figure 15(a)  indicates significant performance improvement in sequence-based MSP over basic MSP across all scan settings, especially when the number of scans is large.
In general , the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly to the left of that of non-DBE MSP , which indicates that DBE
