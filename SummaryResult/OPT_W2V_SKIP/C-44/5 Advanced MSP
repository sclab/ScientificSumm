From this example, we can see that iterative processing of the sequence could help further shrink the polygon of each target node, and thus enhance the accuracy of the system.
Iterative MSP: Reprocessing Scan 1 From above, we can see that the sequence-based MSP makes use of the information embedded in every sequential node pair in the node sequence.
Four Cases in DBE Process no neighbor node in the original event-based node sequence shares an overlapping area , or if the neighbors have not been processed due to bigger gaps , a uniform distribution Uniform ( ) is applied to
