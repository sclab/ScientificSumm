Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).
For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: â€¢ Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9].
