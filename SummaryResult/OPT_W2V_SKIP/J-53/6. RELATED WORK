Examples of this approach are queuing in first-come, first-served (FCFS) order, queueing using the  resource consumption of tasks (e.g., [28]), and scheduling  using combinatorial optimization [19].
Their  methodology follows the study of congestion (potential) games [17, 22] by relating the Nash equilibrium to the solution of a (usually convex) global optimization problem.
SHARE allocates resources using a centralized combinatorial auction that allows users to express preferences with  complementarities.
We view scheduling and resource allocation as two separate functions.
There are two main groups of related work in resource allocation : those that incorporate an economic mechanism , and those that
