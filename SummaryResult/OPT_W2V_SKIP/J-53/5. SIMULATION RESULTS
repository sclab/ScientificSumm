we consider that the system has converged if the utility gap of each user is smaller than (0.001 in our experiments).
For both user preference models, the efficiency at the  equilibrium is approximately 0.9, independent of the number of users, which is only slightly worse than the social optimum.
When âˆ† = 5, there is a performance drop, in particular with respect to the fairness metrics, in the range between 20 and 40 users (where it does not converge).
A convergence time of 200 iterations indicates non-convergence , in which case we report the efficiency and fairness values at the point
