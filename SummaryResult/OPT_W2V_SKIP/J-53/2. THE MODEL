Now, player 2 has to put a positive bid on machine 2 to claim the machine, but there is no lower limit, resulting in the non-existence of the Nash equilibrium.
The additional consideration we have is that each user i has a budget constraint Xi.
By the assumption that the user is selfish, each user"s bidding vector is the best response to the system.
To rule out this case , we consider those strongly competitive games.1 Under the infinite parallelism model , a game is called strongly competitive if for any 1 ≤ j ≤ n , there
