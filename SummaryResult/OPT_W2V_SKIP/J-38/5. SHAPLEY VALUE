Without loss of generality, since the bound is  multiplicative, we can normalize the game to having v(N) = 1.
Computing the Shapley value of a MACG N, M, A, a, w , when w can be an arbitrary polynomial of the aggregates a, is #P-hard, even when the Shapley value of each aggregator can be efficiently computed.
For a coalition S , the first aggregator evaluates to 1 if agent 1 âˆˆ S , and the second aggregator evaluates to 1 if both agents are in S. While agent 2 is not a dummy with respect to the second attribute ,
