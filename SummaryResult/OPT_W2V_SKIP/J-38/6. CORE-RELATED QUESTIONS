6.3 Core Membership Since it is possible for the game induced by the MACG to have a non-empty core when the core of the aggregate value function is empty (Example 3), we try to explore the problem of Core Membership assuming that the core of both the game among attributes, M, w , and the underlying game, N, v , is known to be non-empty, and see if there is any relationship between their members.
When there is no restriction on the entries of Z , it is always possible to decompose a payoff vector x in the core of N ,
