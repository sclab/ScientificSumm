At a finer level, we can extend the model to consider a wider range of skills, such as passing,  shooting, and tackling, but the value of a team remains solely a function of the attributes of its players.
When agents interact with one another, the value of their contribution is determined by what they can do with their skills and resources, rather than simply their identities.
Given the exogenous input of market prices, the value of a group of companies will be determined by these attributes.
Many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by picking the right attributes.
