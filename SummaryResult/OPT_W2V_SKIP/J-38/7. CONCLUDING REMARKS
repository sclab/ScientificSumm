Representation results regarding efficiency of updates, and algorithmic results regarding how to compute the different solution concepts from updates, will both be very interesting.
Its space  requirement compares favorably with other representations discussed in the literature, and hence it serves well as a prototype to study computational complexity of coalitional game theory for a variety of problems.
An important direction to explore in the future is the question of efficiency in updating a game, and how to  evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch.
