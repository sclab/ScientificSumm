(Shapley Value) Given a description of the coalitional game and an agent i, compute the Shapley value of agent i.
In a simple game, a coalition either wins, in which case it has a value of 1, or loses, in which case it has a value of 0.
If a simple game is monotonic, then it is fully described by the set of minimal winning coalitions, i.e., coalitions S for which v(S) = 1 but for all coalitions T ⊂ S, v(T) = 0.
An outcome x ∈ R|N| is in the core of the game N , v if
