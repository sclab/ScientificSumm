Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of  different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the  equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour.
the â€˜easy" choice task discussed above, but vary the  number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.
Finally , it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement ( reflected in the lower
