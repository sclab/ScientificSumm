Using the key notions of a limited communication network , a simple learning process , and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints , we showed ( 1 ) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability , ( 2 ) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected , but that both are important in more complex environments , ( 3 ) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of
