Then, in order to achieve the desired competitive ratio, it must execute job x continuously until its deadline, which is by construction at least as late as the new deadline df of job f. Thus, job f will not be completed, and, by IR and NNP, it must be the case that pf (θf , θ−f , θx) = 0 and uf (g(θf , θ−f , θx), θf ) = 0.
No major job is released after job m. In order to achieve the desired competitive ratio , Γ must complete some major job f , because Γoffline can always at least complete major job 1
