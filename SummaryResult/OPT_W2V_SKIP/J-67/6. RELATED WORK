The only other paper we are aware of that addresses the issue of incentive compatibility in a real-time system is [11], which considers several variants of a model in which the center allocates bandwidth to agents who declare both their value and their arrival time.
This paper also launched the area of  algorithmic mechanism design, in which the mechanism must  sat69 isfy computational requirements in addition to the standard incentive requirements.
For a survey of this and other topics in distributed algorithmic mechanism design, see [9].
A dominant strategy IC mechanism is presented for the variant in which every point
