Because in general this job could have  laxity, the oﬄine algorithm may be able to complete it outside of the range [tb , te ].1 If the algorithm completes the active job and this job"s length is at least te −tb +p loss 4 , then the algorithm is guaranteed to be 4-competitive for this  interval (note that k = 1 implies that all jobs have the same value density and thus that lengths can used to compute the competitive ratio).
Since a job can not be executed before its release time , the space of possible outcomes is restricted in
