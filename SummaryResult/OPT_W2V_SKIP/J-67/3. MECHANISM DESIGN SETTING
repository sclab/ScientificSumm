However, since the end is not well-defined in this online setting, we choose to model returning the job if it is completed and collecting a payment from each agent i as occurring at ˆdi, which,  according to the agent"s declaration, is the latest relevant point of time for that agent.
The restriction on the schedule is now that S(ˆθ, t) = i  implies ˆri ≤ t, to capture the fact that a job cannot be  scheduled on the processor before it is declared to the mechanism.
While in the non-strategic setting it was sufficient for the algorithm
