In this paper, we considered an online scheduling domain for which algorithms with the best possible competitive  ratio had been found, but for which new solutions were  required when the setting is extended to include self-interested agents.
Also, while we feel that it is reasonable to strengthen the  assumption of knowing the maximum possible ratio of value  densities (k) to knowing the actual range of possible value  densities, it would be interesting to determine whether there exists a ((1 + âˆš k)2 + 1)-competitive mechanism under the original assumption.
We presented a mechanism that is incentive compatible with respect to
