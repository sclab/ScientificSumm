From the fact that the maximum payment must be extracted from each bidder bxi , it follows that for each i, πc+xi + πc−xi ≥ 2H.
This allows us to extract the maximum payment from the bids bxi -a total payment of 2vH − c. Additionally , the utility of bidder bj is now i : r j i > 0 rj i ( H − x∗ i ) + i : r j i < 0 −rj i ( H + x∗ i ) = ( i |rj i | ) H − i rj i x∗ i ≥ ( i
