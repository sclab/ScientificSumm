But now notice that this expression is maximized as a function of πci by the decomposed  solution for this charity (the terms without πci in them do not matter, and of course in the decomposed solution we always set πbi j = ui j(πci )).
Because in an optimal solution, we will extract as much payment from the bidders as possible given the πci , all we need to show is that the πci are set optimally by this approach.
It follows that if we change πci to the decomposed solution , the change in surplus will be at least 0 (
