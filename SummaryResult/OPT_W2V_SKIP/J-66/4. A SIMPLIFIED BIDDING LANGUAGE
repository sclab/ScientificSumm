One might wonder why, if we are given the bidders" utility functions, we do not simply maximize the sum of the  utilities rather than surplus or total donated.
Even if we restricted the possible total payment made to each charity to the set {0, 1, 2, .
This special case is justified in settings where the scale of the donations by the bidders is small relative to the amounts the charities receive from other sources, so that the marginal use of a dollar to the charity is not affected by the amount given by the bidders.
