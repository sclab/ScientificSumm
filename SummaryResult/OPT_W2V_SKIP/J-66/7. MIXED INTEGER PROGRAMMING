Using the fact that the function is concave, for each value of πci , the tightest upper bound on ui j is the one corresponding to the segment above that value of πci , and therefore these constraints are sufficient to force the correct value of ui j.
Now, let xi,j l be an indicator variable that should be 1 if πci is below the lth segment of the function, and 0 otherwise.
Each ui j is given as a function of πci by the (piecewise linear) function provided by the bidder.
Representing this function is entirely analogous to how we
