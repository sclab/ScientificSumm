Third, as we saw in Section 9, the clearing problem is much easier in 5 Formally, this means that if the bidder is forced to pay the full amount that his bid allows for a particular vector of payments to charities, the bidder is indifferent between this and not participating in the mechanism at all.
Theorem 7 indicates that there is no reason to decide on donations to multiple charities under a single mechanism (rather than a separate one for each charity), when an  efficient mechanism with the desired properties exists for the single-charity case.
This is not too surprising
