The algorithm forms Ω as a set that is  conflict-freethis means that prohibitions are annotated with a conflict set that indicates which bindings for variables have to be avoided.
|te − te| ≤ |ta − ta| That is, a prohibition and a permission conflict (condition 1) if, and only if, the agents and roles they apply to and their actions, respectively, unify under σ (condition 2) and their activation  periods overlap (condition 3).
We, therefore, have to find the maximal set of conflicting pairs of permissions and prohibitions in Ω, by performing a pairwise inspection.
Our algorithm is correct in
