VOs should allow for two kinds of non-determinism  corresponding to choices autonomous agents can make, viz., i) the one  arising when there is more than one edge leaving a state; and ii) the one arising from variables in the formulae Ï• labelling an edge, for which the agent carrying out the action instantiates.
2.1 Semantics of VOs The specification of a VO as a finite-state machine gives rise to a possibly infinite set of histories of computational behaviours, in which the actions labelling the paths from the initial state to a final state are recorded.
We formally represent our VOs
