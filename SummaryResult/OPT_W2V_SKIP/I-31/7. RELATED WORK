However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper.
Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.
A notable and recent exception is a logical framework for  judgment aggregation developed by Marc Pauly in [10], in order to be able to characterise the logical relationships between different  judgment aggregation rules.
This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying structure to represent individual and
