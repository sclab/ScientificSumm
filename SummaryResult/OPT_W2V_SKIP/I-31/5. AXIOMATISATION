In fact, our  axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of f. To be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ.
We don"t want all of those: it might well be that ψ requires σ to be in a certain way, which is incompatible with some Δ"s. We define two accessibility relations in the standard way: R Δ1Δ2 iff for all ψ: ψ ∈ Δ1 ⇒ ψ ∈ Δ2.
We point out that jal has all the axioms taut , K , T
