Note that when we are given a formula φ ∈ L(Σ, A), validity, i.e., |=L φ, is defined with respect to models of the particular  language L(Σ, A) defined over the particular agenda A (and similar for validity with respect to a JAR, i.e., f |=L φ).
The agenda, like the set of agents Σ, is given when we define the language, and is thus implicit in the interpretation of the language1 .
For example , if the agenda contains some formula which is inconsistent in the underlying logic ( and , by implication , some tautology ) ,
