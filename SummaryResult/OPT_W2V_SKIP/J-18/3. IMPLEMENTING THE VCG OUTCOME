In contrast, for every c > 1, if say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates directly and bids less than cv1, then the T-strategy yields a negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1.
if v1 > v2 and player 2 bids directly v2 (without using the mediator services), then bidding directly v1 is better for player 1 than using the  Tstrategy: in the former case player 1"s utility is 0 and in the latter case her utility is negative.
We define a family of mediators mc , c ≥ 1 , each of them
