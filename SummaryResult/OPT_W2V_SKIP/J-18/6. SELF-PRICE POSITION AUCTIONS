The proof in this example can be easily generalized to show that the VCG outcome function can be implemented by a valid  mediator in a self-price position auction, in which there is one position and an arbitrary number of players, n â‰¥ 2.
Next we show that it is impossible to implement the VCG outcome function, even by a non-valid mediator, in a  selfprice position auction which has more than one position (m > 1).
We will show that in this case 285 there is a way to implement the VCG outcome function in a self-price position auction.
The proof of
