We first show it for s(v, i) = 1, that is δ(v, 1) = i.
If s(v, i) > 1, we  distinguish between two cases.
If j /∈ K then player i"s 8 Recall that s(b, i) denotes the position of player i under the bid profile b, and δ(b, j) denotes the set of players assigned to position j.
We define a mediator m , which will implement the VCG outcome function in G : For every v ∈ V let mN ( v ) = b ( v ) , where b ( v
