Since the simple bag-of-words representation at the document-level leads to a learned model that behaves somewhat like a context-specific prior dependent on the sender/receiver and general topic, a first choice would be to treat it as such when combining probability estimates with the sentence-level classifier.
Finally, it would be interesting to investigate the best methods for combining the document-level and sentence-level classifiers.
Such a model might serve as a general example for other problems where bag-of-words can establish a baseline model but richer approaches are needed to achieve performance beyond that baseline. 
Such methods include alternate ways of combining the
