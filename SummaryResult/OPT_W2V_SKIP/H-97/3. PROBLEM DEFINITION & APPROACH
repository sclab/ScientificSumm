The obvious benefit of the document-level approach is that training set collection costs are lower since the user only has to specify whether or not an e-mail contains an action-item and not the specific sentences.
In addition, for the sentence-level classifiers that use  ngrams, we additionally code for each sentence a binary encoding of the position of the sentence relative to the document.
