Therefore, it may be possible for the principal to  maximize its utility by contracting with only m of the n nodes along the path.
Under the optimal contract, sB i = (1−k+q)i c(k−1) q < 0 Therefore, under any other contract the sender will have to  compensate each node with an expected payment that is higher than its expected transit cost.
While the expected outcome depends on m, it is independent of which specific m nodes are induced.
Individual autonomous systems ( AS '' s ) can either adopt hot-potato routing or early exit routing ( a = 0 )
