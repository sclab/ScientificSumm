Because the expected benefit when all nodes forward is the same under both scenarios, we only need to show that the expected total payment is identical as well.
We found that in the absence of per-hop information, the expected cost of each intermediate node equals its expected payment.
Under the optimal contract that induces high-effort behavior from all intermediate nodes in the Nash Equi118 librium2 , the expected payment to each node is the same as its expected cost , with the following payment schedule : sB i = si ( x = xB ) = 0 ( 2 )
