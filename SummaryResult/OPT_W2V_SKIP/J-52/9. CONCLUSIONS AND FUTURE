In addition, in scenarios of unknown transit costs, it is also possible to design mechanisms that induce cooperative behavior in equilibrium, but the sender pays a premium for extracting information from the  transit nodes.
We  conclude that monitoring per-hop outcomes may not improve the  utility of the participants or the network performace.
Our preliminary results show that when several senders compete for a single transit node"s  capacity, the sender with the highest demand pays a premium even if transit costs are common knowledge.
We plan to study under what mechanisms this strategy profile may emerge as a unique
