We will show that FPSS induces an equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal their transit costs and forward packets if they are on the LCP.
4.2 Discussion More generally, for any mechanism M that induces a bid vector b in equilibrium by making a payment of pi(b) to node i on the LCP, there exists a mechanism M that induces an equilibrium with the same bid vector and packet forwarding by making a payment of: sB i = 0 sG i = pi(b) (1 − k)n−i+1 .
In addition to the generalization of FPSS into FPSS , we can
