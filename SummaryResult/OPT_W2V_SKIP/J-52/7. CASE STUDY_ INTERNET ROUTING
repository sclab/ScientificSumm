Recently, several new architectures have been proposed in the context of the Internet to provide the principal not only with a set of paths from which it can chose (like BGP does) but also with the performance along those paths and the network topology.
In this case, the principal (e.g., a multi-homed site or a tier-1 AS) can implement one of the mechanisms proposed in Section 4 by contracting with individual nodes on the path.
Another approach is to have third parties like Keynote independently monitor the network performance. 
Since the protocol reveals only the autonomous systems ( AS ''
