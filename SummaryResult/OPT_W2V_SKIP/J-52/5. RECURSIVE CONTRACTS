In recursive payment, the principal contracts with the first node on the path, which in turn contracts with the second, and so on, such that each node contracts with its downstream node and makes the payment based on the final result, as demonstrated in figure 6.
When the principal comes to design a contract with node A, he needs to consider the subsequent contract that A should sign with B, which should satisfy the following constrints.
• What is the relation between the total expected payment  under direct and recursive contracts?
