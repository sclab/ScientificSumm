We further demonstrate that per-hop monitoring does not necessarily improve the utility of the principal or the social welfare in the system.
Using a principal-agent model, we show how the hidden-action problem can be overcome through  appropriate design of contracts, in both the direct (the endpoints contract with each individual router) and recursive (each router contracts with the next  downstream router) cases.
In multi-hop networks, the actions taken by individual intermediate nodes are typically hidden from the communicating endpoints; all the endpoints can observe is whether or not the end-to-end transmission was successful.
Therefore , in the absence of incentives
