Given a query in the source language, our CLQS task is to determine one or several similar queries in the target language from the query log.
The principle is as follows: for a reasonable monolingual query similarity between two queries, a cross-lingual correspondent can be deduced between one query and another query"s translation.
Then the cohesion between the translations of two query terms is measured using mutual information which is computed as follows: )()( ),( log),()( , klij klij klijklij tPtP ttP ttPttMI = (6) where .
The key problem with cross-lingual query suggestion is how to learn a similarity measure between two
