In [1], the target language query log has been exploited to help query translation in CLIR. 
In addition, word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19].
As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language.
This observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (CLQE) techniques [2, 16, 18].
Therefore , CLQS also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the common formulations of similar
