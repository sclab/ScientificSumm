To reduce network traffic and only disseminate those events to the  subscribers which they are really interested in and which have a chance to arrive timely, the encapsulation and scoping schemes have to be transformed into respective multi-level filtering rules.
One direction of future research will be the inclusion of real-world communication channels established between sensors and actuators in the temporal analysis and the  ordering of such events in a cause-effect chain.
The event attributes which describe aspects of the context and temporal constraints for the  dissemination will be exploited for this purpose.
We can not assume that the network
