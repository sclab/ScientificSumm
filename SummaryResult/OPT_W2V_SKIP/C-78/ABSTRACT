To a large extent, such systems operate proactively and independently of direct  human control driven by the perception of the environment and the ability to organize respective computations dynamically.
This is complemented by the notion of event channels which are abstractions of the  underlying network and allow to enforce quality attributes.
A crucial design decision is the choice of the appropriate abstractions and interaction mechanisms.
The paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on events-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the  system.
