Interaction with the  environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as  discussed in Section 4.2.
A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the  existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.
In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of  communication through the environment.
We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators , which interact with the objects by disseminating or
