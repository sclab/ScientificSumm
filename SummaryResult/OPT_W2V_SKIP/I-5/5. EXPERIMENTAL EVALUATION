The first experiment show the  performance in a stable environment where a number of agents allocate tasks to servers that provide a constant amount of resources.
At the beginning of the experiment, all agents allocate their tasks randomly at one of the available servers and explore the available capacities and resource utilisations for about 150 time units.
The second experiment was conducted in a  dynamic server environment with a constant number of agents.
- n-distribution predictor : uses a random value from the frequency distribution of the n last history values - n-mirror predictor : p ( n ) =
