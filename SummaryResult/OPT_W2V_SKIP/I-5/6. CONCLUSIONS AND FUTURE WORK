We are aware of the long learning phase in environments with a large number of shared resources known by each agent.
In the case of a server becomes  unavailable, the agents can adapt quickly to this new situation by exploring new resources or remain at the home server if an allocation is not possible.
This mechanism was inspired by inductive reasoning and bounded rationality principles which enables the agents"  adaptation of their strategies to compete effectively in a  dynamic environment.
It is a distributed, scalable and easy-to-understand  policy for the regulation of supply and demand of resources.
Our approach
