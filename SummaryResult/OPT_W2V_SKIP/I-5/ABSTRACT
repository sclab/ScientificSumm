We present results of the proposed resource allocation mechanism in the simulated static and dynamic multi-server environment.
These techniques need to take into account the heterogeneity and potential unreliability of resources and resource consumers in a distributed  environments.
In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm that solves the resource allocation problem in distributed  multiagent systems.
The resource allocation in the system is a purely emergent effect.
Our solution is based on the self-organisation of agents, which does not require any facilitator or  management layer.
Distributed applications require distributed techniques for efficient resource allocation.
