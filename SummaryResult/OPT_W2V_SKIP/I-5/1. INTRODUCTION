Another mainly unsolved problem of those approaches is the fine-tuning of price and time, budget constraints to enable efficient resource allocation in large, dynamic systems [22].
In this paper we propose a distributed solution of the  resource allocation problem based on self-organisation of the resource consumers in a system with limited resources.
In our approach, agents dynamically allocate tasks to servers that provide a limited amount of resources.
With the increasing popularity of distributed computing technologies such as Grid [ 12 ] and Web services [ 20 ] , the Internet is becoming a powerful computing platform where different software
