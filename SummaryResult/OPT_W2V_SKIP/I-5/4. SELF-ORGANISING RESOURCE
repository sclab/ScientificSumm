In the case, no free resources are expected (line 9), the agent will explore resources by  allocating the task at a randomly selected server from all not predictable servers to gather resource load information.
In the case where the set of servers predicted having free resources available is not empty (line 13), the agent selects one of those for allocation.

The collective action of these agents change the environment and , as time
