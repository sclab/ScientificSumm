We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning  mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience.
This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation  solution.
Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the  relationship of flexibility and success probability.
Instead of solving the negotiation chain problem in a centralized approach , we adopt a distributed approach where each
