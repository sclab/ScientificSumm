Mailler and Lesser [4] have presented an  approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the  negotiation chain scenario occurs.
In our work, the negotiation involves more  complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.
However, this work is limited since it only involves a single agent"s perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part of a negotiation chain.
It models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem ( DCOP ) and a cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions
