Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of  linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing  capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.
Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.
Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents"  interactive actions.
