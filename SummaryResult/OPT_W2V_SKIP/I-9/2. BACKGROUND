In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly,  linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents.
In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or  removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources.
Temporal logic , on the other hand , is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values
