We assume that the only way agent i can affect the true qi(t) is by superficially increasing his demand for the cached item, but not the other way (that is, agent"s loss, incurred by giving up a necessary request for the item, is not negligible).
In this problem, agent i gains the value vT i if a particular item is loaded to the local shared cache.
Given that the payments are increasing with the declared values , the forth and fifth requirements ensure that the agent would not increase his demand superficially and so qi ( t
