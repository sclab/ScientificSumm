Even if the information is recorded with some probability, this enables us to implement a wider range of social goals,  using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
As a case study, we apply our methods to derive Peer-to-Peer network mechanism for file sharing.
As it turns out, many natural social goals cannot be implemented using the  dominant strategy concept [35, 32, 22, 20].
This suggests that the standard requirements must be relaxed in order to construct general-purpose mechanisms.
We thus suggest a notion of partially informed environments.
The main positive results are the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (
