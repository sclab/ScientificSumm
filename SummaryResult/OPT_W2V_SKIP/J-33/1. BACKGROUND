In particular, we use the framework to  explore tradeoffs between expressive power of agent bids and  computational properties of auction clearing.
In a call market, in contrast, bids accumulate until designated times (e.g., on a periodic or scheduled basis) at which the auction clears by determining a comprehensive match over the entire set of bids.
Other efforts focus on the optimization problem facing the bid taker, for example considering side constraints on the  combination of trades comprising an overall deal [4].
The role of the auction is to elicit these functions ( possibly approximate or partial versions ) , and
