Unlike the previous model we allow fractional flow for this case, representing the traded fraction of the buyer"s total quantity.7 We tested all three models on random data in the form of  bipartite graphs encoding MMP solutions.
118 Figure 8: Performance of models when varying percentage of aggregating traders Figure 8 shows how the various models are affected by a change in the percentage of aggregating traders, holding problem size fixed.8 Due to the integrality constraints, we could not test available  algorithms specialized for network-flow problems on our test  problems.
We found that in addition to the problem
