For example, if sellers submit bounded sets of XOR points, we only need to consider the points in the  combined set offered by the sellers, and the reduction to network flow is polynomial regardless of the number of homogeneous attributes.
GAP is more general than the formulation above as it allows  buyside quantities (Â¯qi above) to be different for each potential seller.
Therefore, the next generalization allows any combination of the two boolean constraints, that is, any trader chooses among four bid types: NI Bid AON and not aggregating.
We define two graph families , one for the case of
