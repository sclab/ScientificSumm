Note that when xh is an interior point of Oc then the  situation is symmetric for the two agents 1 and 2, and the mediator has the choice of either finding a point on IC1(xh) to  improve the utility of agent 2, or finding a point on IC2(xh) to improve the utility of agent 1.
That is, we are searching for points x within the feasible set Oc such that moving to x from the current tentative agreement x brings more gains to at least one of the agents while not hurting any of the agents.
