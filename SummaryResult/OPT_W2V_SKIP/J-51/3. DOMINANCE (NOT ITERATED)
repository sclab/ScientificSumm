On the other hand, if this program has a solution with  objective value > 0, then for at least one strategy σc ∈ Σc we 5 Recall that the assumption of a single opponent (that is, the assumption of two players) is without loss of generality for one-shot dominance.
89 better against at least one).5 Next, we show that  checking whether a given strategy is dominated by some mixed strategy can be done in polynomial time by solving a single linear program.
As a first observation , checking whether a given strategy is strictly ( weakly ) dominated by some
