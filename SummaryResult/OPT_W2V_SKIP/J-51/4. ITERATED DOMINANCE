In contrast, iterated weak dominance is known to be  pathdependent.6 For example, in the following game, using  iterated weak dominance we can eliminate M first, and then D, or R first, and then U. L M R U 1, 1 0, 0 1, 0 D 1, 1 1, 0 0, 0 Therefore, while the procedure of removing weakly  dominated strategies until no more weakly dominated strategies remain can certainly be executed in polynomial time, which strategies survive in the end depends on the order in which we remove the dominated strategies.
