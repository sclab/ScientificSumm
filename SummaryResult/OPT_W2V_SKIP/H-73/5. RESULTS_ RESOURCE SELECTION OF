DATABASE RECOMMENDATION All four testbeds described in Section 4 were used in the experiments to evaluate the resource selection effectiveness of the database recommendation system.
The experiments summarized in Figure 3 compared the effectiveness of the three resource selection algorithms, namely the CORI, ReDDE and UUM/HR.
Fifty queries (101-150) were used as training queries to build the relevant logistic model and to fit the exponential functions of the centralized document score curves for large ratio databases (details in Section 3.1).
Another 50 queries (51-100) were used as test data.
And let Bi and Ei denote the number of relevant documents
