The UUM/HP-FL algorithm also selected 3 or 5 databases, but it was allowed to adjust the number of documents to retrieve from each selected database; the number retrieved was constrained to be from 10 to 100, and a multiple of 10.
On the representative testbed, CORI is much less effective than other algorithms for distributed document retrieval (Tables 5 and 6).
Other experiments with databases that return no document scores are not reported but they show similar results to prove the effectiveness of UUM/HP-FL and  UUM/HPVL algorithms.
In all of the experiments discussed in this section the results retrieved from
