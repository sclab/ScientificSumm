However, two weakness of this testbed are: i) Each database contains only a small amount of document (259 documents by average for WT2g) [4]; and ii) The contents of WT2g or WT10g are arbitrarily crawled from the Web.
As the contents and sizes of the databases in the TREC news/government testbed are more similar with that of a topic-oriented database, it is a good candidate to simulate the distributed information retrieval environments of large organizations (companies) or  domainspecific hidden Web sites, such as West that provides access to legal, financial and news text databases [3].
