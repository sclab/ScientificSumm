In order to achieve accurate document retrieval results, many previous methods simply use resource selection algorithms that are effective of database recommendation system.
This framework computes a selection that minimizes the overall costs (e.g., retrieval quality, time) of document retrieval system and several methods [15] have been proposed to estimate the retrieval quality.
The first problem of distributed information retrieval is resource representation.
As prior research on different datasets has shown the CORI algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [1,17,18], we use it as a baseline algorithm in this work.
