In addition, it is the first model to consider load-dependent failures in such framework, where the failure probability of each resource depends on the number of agents selecting this resource.
In a CGLF, agents share a common set of resources, where each resource has a cost and a probability of failure.
It is the first model to  incorporate failures into congestion settings, which results in a strict generalization of congestion games.
The utility of an agent is the  difference between his benefit from successful task completion and the sum of the costs over the resources he uses.
We define a
