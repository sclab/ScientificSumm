Our work provides the first model of congestion settings with resource failures, which considers the sum of  congestiondependent costs over utilized resources, and therefore, does not extend the CGF-model, but rather generalizes the classic model of congestion games.
Furthermore, the procedures proposed by the authors in [10] for the construction of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium are not valid in our model, even in the simple, agent-symmetric case, where all agents have the same benefit from successful completion of their tasks.
Monderer [ 8 ] dealt with another type of generalization of congestion games , in which the resource cost
