Our main conclusions from this study are the following: • Parameter optimization in AF is an open challenge but has not been thoroughly studied in the past.
We presented a cross-benchmark evaluation of incremental Rocchio and incremental LR in adaptive filtering, focusing on their robustness in terms of performance consistency with respect to cross-corpus parameter optimization.
For future research we want to study explicit modeling of the temporal trends in topic distributions and content drifting.
• We found Rocchio performs strongly when a good validation corpus is available , and a preferred choice when optimizing Ctrk is the objective ,
