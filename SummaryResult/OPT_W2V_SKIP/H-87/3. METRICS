The implications of the above analysis are rather significant: • Ctrk defined in the same formula does not necessarily mean the same objective function in evaluation; instead, the optimization criterion depends on the test corpus.
For evaluating the performance of a system, Ctrk is computed for each topic first and then the resulting scores are averaged for a single measure (the topic-weighted Ctrk).
