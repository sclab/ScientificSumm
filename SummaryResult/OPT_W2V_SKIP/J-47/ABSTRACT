We first focus on auctions that use a polynomial number of demand queries, and then we analyze the power of different kinds of ascending-price auctions.
We embark on a systematic analysis of the power and  limitations of iterative combinatorial auctions.
We prove a large number of results showing the boundaries of what can be achieved by auctions of this kind.
Most existing iterative combinatorial auctions are based on repeatedly  suggesting prices for bundles of items, and querying the bidders for their demand under these prices.
