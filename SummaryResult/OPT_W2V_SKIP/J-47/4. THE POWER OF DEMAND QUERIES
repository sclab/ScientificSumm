First we note that value queries are not completely powerless: In [19] it is shown that if the m items are split into k fixed bundles of size m/k each, and these fixed bundles are  auctioned as though each was indivisible, then the social welfare bers, thus we may have bundles with arbitrarily close  relative demands.
37 We will show that any bundle-price auction that uses only the XOR-language to describe bundle prices requires an  exponential cost (which includes the sum of all description lengths of prices) to find an optimal allocation between any two such valuations.
Any iterative auction
