This means that node i (or possibly its children) will have to combine the proofs that they receive to generate a proof of the rest of path quality.
It involves the source sharing the proofs it generates with nodes further down the path, which use them to determine bilateral payments.
This argument can be iterated along the entire path to the penultimate node before D. Since the marginal costs and qualities can be arranged to make any path the optimal path, these statements must hold for all nodes and their children, which completes the proof.
The two possibilities for monitor
