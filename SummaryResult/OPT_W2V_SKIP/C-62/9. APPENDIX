If ( ) ( ) knlV , , is maximal over Ln , it is also maximal over the paths in Ln+1 that don '' t lead to n. This means that node n can choose some n small enough so that ( ) nlV , is maximal over Ln+1 , so the route will lead to k. Conversely , if ( ) ( ) knlV , , is not maximal over Ln , either V is greater for another of n '' s next hops , in which case n will select that one in order to increase n
