This example shows that other types of monitors may be useful as building blocks, but must be combined to form rest of path monitors in order to achieve ideal innovation characteristics.
The network"s lack of accountability is highly relevant to a discussion of innovation because it constrains the system of contracts.
In other words, unless new monitoring capabilities are introduced, and integrated with the system of contracts, the network cannot achieve optimal routing and innovation characteristics.
Instead of focusing on incremental improvements , we try to imagine how an ideal industry would behave , then derive the
