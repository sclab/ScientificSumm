The two steps are: (1) based on current term  clustering Cluˆt, for each document d, the algorithm segments all the sentences Sd into p segments sequentially (some  segments may be empty), and put them into the p segments ˆS of the whole training set D (all possible cases of different segmentation Segd and alignment Alid are checked) to find the optimal case, and (2) based on the current segmentation and alignment, for each term t, the algorithm finds the best term cluster of t based on the current segmentation Segd and alignment Alid.
For multi-document segmentation without term clustering and
