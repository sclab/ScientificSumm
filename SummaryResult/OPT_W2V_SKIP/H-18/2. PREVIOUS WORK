Previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].
Some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as PLSA [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using MI for topic segmentation has not been studied. 
While some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others  utilize multiple documents [16, 14].
Some models consider dependence between sentences and sections , such as Hidden Markov Model [ 3 , 27 ] , Maximum Entropy Markov Model [ 19
