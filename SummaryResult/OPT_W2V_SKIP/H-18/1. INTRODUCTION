Thus, the extension of topic  segmentation from single documents to identifying similar segments from multiple similar documents with the same topic is a natural and necessary direction, and multi-document topic segmentation is expected to have a better performance since more information is utilized.
Many methods based on sentence similarity require that these words are removed before topic segmentation can be performed [15].
We also introduce the new criterion of WMI based on term weights learned from  multiple similar documents, which can improve performance of topic segmentation further.
Section 3 contains a formulation of the problem of topic segmentation and alignment
