For  example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to  optimize some cut value (e.g.
As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like Kmeans and Gaussian  Mixture Model (GMM) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is  usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g.
However , unlike spectral clustering , which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [ 2 ] , our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point
