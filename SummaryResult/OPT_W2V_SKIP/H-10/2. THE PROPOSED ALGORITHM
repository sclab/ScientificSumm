Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1, we choose it to be our local label predictor, such that for each document xi, the following criterion is minimized Ji = 1 ni xj ∈Ni wT i xj − qj 2 + λi wi 2 , (7) where ni = |Ni| is the cardinality of Ni, and qj is the  cluster membership of xj.
2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold , since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M , q ( x
