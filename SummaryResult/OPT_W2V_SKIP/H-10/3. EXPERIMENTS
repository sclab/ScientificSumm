3.2 Evaluation Metrics In the experiments, we set the number of clusters equal to the true number of classes C for all the clustering  algorithms.
For computational efficiency, in the implementation of CPLR and our CLGR algorithm, we have set all the local regularization parameters {Î»i}n i=1 to be identical, which is set by grid search from {0.1, 1, 10}.
(31) is used as a performance measure for the given clustering result.
In our experiments , we use a subset of the data collection which includes the 10 most frequent categories among the 135 topics and we call it
