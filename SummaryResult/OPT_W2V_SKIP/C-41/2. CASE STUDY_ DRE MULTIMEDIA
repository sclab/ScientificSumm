In contrast, we treat QoS  requirements such as video frame rate and picture resolution as softer QoS requirements and modify these video properties adaptively to handle dynamic changes in resource  availabil2 Although hard and soft are often portrayed as two discrete requirement sets, in practice they are usually two ends of a continuum ranging from softer to harder rather than two disjoint points.
This condition can arise from loss of resources - network bandwidth and/or  computing power at base station, end receiver or at UAV - or may be due to an increase in resource demands by  applications.
