Figure 4 shows that HyARM maintains system utilization close to the desired utilization set point during fluctuation in  input work load by transmitting video of higher (or lower) QoS for QoS-enabled (or best-effort) class of applications during over (or under) utilization of system resources.
During over utilization of system resources, resolution and frame rate of lower priority applications are reduced to adapt to fluctuations in  application workload and to maintain the utilization of resources at the specified set point.
Our conclusions from analyzing the results described above are that applying adaptive middleware via hybrid control to DRE system helps to
