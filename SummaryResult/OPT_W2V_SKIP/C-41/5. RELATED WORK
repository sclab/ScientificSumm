HyARM can therefore be applied to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of control variables.
Although existing FCS algorithms have shown promise, these algorithms often assume that the system has continuous control variable(s) that can continuously be adjusted.
The DRE multimedia system as described in Section 2 is an example DRE system that offers both  continuous (picture resolution) and discrete set (frame-rate) of control variables.
These variables are modified by HyARM to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved  application QoS. 
While this assumption holds for certain classes of systems , there are many classes of DRE systems ,
