We can lower bound the competitive ratio of Υs,t 3 using the same worst-case distribution from [8] that we used against F(2) .
Similarly, we can find the optimal auction against Gs,t using the same technique we used to solve for the three bidder auction with the best competitive ratio against F(2) .
Note that the form of Υs , t 3 is essentially the same as for Υ3 , but that the probability of each price is scaled depending on the values of s and t. That our auction for three bidders matches the lower bound computed
