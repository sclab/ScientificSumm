Furthermore, the auction raises exactly 6 13 F(2) on every input with non-identical bids.
If any of the inequalities 1 ≤ x ≤ y are not strict, the same proof applies giving a lower bound on the auction"s profit; however, this bound may no longer be tight.
The optimal auction for the finite auction problem can be found by the following optimization problem in which the variables are ρb-i ( z ) : maximize r subject to n i=1 bi z=1 zρb-i ( z ) dz ≥ rF ( 2 ) ( b ) ∞ z=1 ρb-i
