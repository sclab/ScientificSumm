Since [9] this search has led to improved understanding of the nature of the  optimal auction, the techniques for on-the-fly pricing in these  scenarios, and the competitive ratio of the optimal auction [5, 7, 8].
This problem is well studied for the auction design problem where the optimal mechanism is the one that brings the seller the most profit.
• Assuming that the conjecture that the optimal -unit auction has a competitive ratio that matches the lower bound proved in [ 8 ] , we show that this optimal auction for ≥ 3 on some inputs will occasionally offer prices
