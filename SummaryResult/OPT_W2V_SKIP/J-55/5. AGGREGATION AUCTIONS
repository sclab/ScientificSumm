Table 1 shows, for each value of m and k, the fraction of F(2) raised by the aggregation auction for AggΥm when there are k winning bidders, assuming the lower bound of Theorem 2 is tight.
We can, however, evaluate this  formula numerically for different values of m and k, assuming that the competitive ratio for Υm matches the lower bound for m given by Theorem 2.
Furthermore , note that we can not yet claim the existence of a good auction via this technique as the optimal auction Υn for n > 3 is not known and it
