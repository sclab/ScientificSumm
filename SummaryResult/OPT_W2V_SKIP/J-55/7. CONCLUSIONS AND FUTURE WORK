The most interesting open question from our work is whether the lower bound from Theorem 2 can be matched by an auction for more than three bidders.
We also show that Î¥3 is not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction, but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive  ratio of the overall auction only a little bit.
Finally, we remark that very little is known about the structure of the optimal competitive auction.
We conjecture that it can.
Second , we consider whether our techniques can be extended to find optimal auctions
