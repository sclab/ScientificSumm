Finally, we generalize a result from [8] and extend our  understanding of the nature of the optimal competitive auction by showing that the optimal competitive auction occasionally offers prices that are higher than all bid values.
We adopt the worst-case competitive framework defined by [9, 5] that  compares the profit of an auction to that of an optimal single-price sale of least two items.
Second, we show that the form of this auction is independent of the  competitive framework used.
Applying this technique to our optimal auction for three items , we achieve an auction with a competitive ratio of
