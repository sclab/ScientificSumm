When specifying a symmetric  scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the relative magnitudes of the n âˆ’ 1 bids in b-i and that one of the bids, bj = 1.
We denote the profit of a truthful auction A on input b as A(b).
In order to evaluate the performance of auctions with respect to the goal of profit maximization, we introduce the optimal single price  omniscient auction F and the related omniscient auction F(2) .
The optimal single price omniscient auction, F, is defined as follows.
This is without loss of generality as
