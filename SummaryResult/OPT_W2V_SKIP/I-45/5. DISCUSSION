We have presented a scheme for mapping commitment machines to BDI platforms (using SAAPL as an exemplar), identified three changes that needed to be made to SAAPL to support CM-based  interaction, and shown that turn management can be avoided in  CMbased interaction, provided the CM is locally monotonic.
There has already been some work on comparing Hermes with a  conventional message-centric approach to designing interaction, and this has shown that using Hermes results in designs that are  significantly more flexible and robust [4].
The three changes to SAAPL , and the translation scheme from commitment machine to BDI plans are
