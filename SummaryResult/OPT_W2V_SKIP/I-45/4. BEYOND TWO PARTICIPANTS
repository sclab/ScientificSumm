The essence of the proof is to argue that as long as agents haven"t yet converged to the same state, all actions must be monotonic, and hence that these actions commute, and cannot disable any other actions.
This argument can be extended to show that once agents start taking different paths through the FSM all actions taken until the point where they converge on a single state must be monotonic , and hence it is always possible to converge ( because actions aren '' t disabled ) , so the interaction is error free ; and the
