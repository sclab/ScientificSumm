Recognising these limitations of the traditional approach to  designing agent interactions, a number of approaches have been  proposed in recent years that move away from message-centric  interaction protocols, and instead consider designing agent interactions using higher-level concepts such as social commitments [8, 10, 18] or interaction goals [2].
It has been argued that this message-centric approach to  interaction design is not a good match for intelligent agents.
However, although there has been work on designing flexible and robust agent interactions, there has been virtually no work on  providing programming language support for implementing such  interactions.
