The previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations  sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
If the relation on A is acyclic, then each extension Ei of <A, Def>, |Ei| = 1.
Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A.
, an ∈ A, with n > 1, such that (ai, ai+1) ∈ R and (an, a1) ∈ R, with 1 ≤ i < n. Note that acyclicity prohibits pairs of arguments a, b such that a b and b a, ie., an acyclic preference relation disallows indifference.
Then
