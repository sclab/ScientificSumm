In this case, it is clear that the two offers o1 and o2 are  nonsupported.
The argumentation system AP , DefP of this agent will return a1 as an accepted argument, and a2 as a rejected one.
P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o1, 2 Note that in the above example, since there is no exchange of arguments, the theories of both agents do not change.
The following dialogue may take place between the two agents : P : m1 = P , θ , o1 , 0 C : m2
