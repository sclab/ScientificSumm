Although physiological measures are sometimes highly  sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and  performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.
Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in  order to enhance human performance.
Cognitive load studies are, by and large,  concerned about working memory capacity and how to  circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.
Most cognitive scientists [ 8 ] believe that human information-processing system consists of
