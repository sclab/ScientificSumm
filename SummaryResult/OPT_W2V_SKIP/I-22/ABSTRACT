In this paper the concept Shared Belief Map is proposed as a basis for developing realistic shared expectations among a team of Human-Agent-Pairs (HAPs).
The shared belief map concept and the cognitive/processing load models have been implemented in a cognitive agent  architectureSMMall.
Human team members often develop shared expectations to predict each other"s needs and coordinate their behaviors.
The establishment of shared belief maps relies on inter-agent information  sharing, the effectiveness of which highly depends on agents"  processing loads and the instantaneous cognitive loads of their human partners.
A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the
