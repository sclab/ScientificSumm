We have only considered the complexity of calculating the Banzhaf index; it  remains an open problem to find the complexity of calculating the Shapley-Shubik or other indices in the network flow domain.
We have assessed the relative power of each agent in this scenario using the Banzhaf index.
Finally, we believe that there are many additional interesting domains other than weighted voting games and network flow games, and it would be worthwhile to investigate the complexity of calculating the Banzhaf index or other power indices in such domains. 
It remains an open problem to find ways to tractably approximate the
