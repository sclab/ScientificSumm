The Shapley-Shubik index [19] is the direct application of the Shapley value to simple coalitional games.
Since the Shapley value of any simple game has the same value as its Shapley-Shubik index, this shows that  calculating the Shapley-Shubik index in weighted majority games is  #Pcomplete.
The problem of computing power indices in simple games  depends on the chosen representation of the game.
In his seminal paper, Shapley [18] considered coalitional games and the fair allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition (the coalition of all agents) to its members.
Since the number of possible coalitions is exponential in
