We define Pv as the number of subsets E ⊂ Predv that contain a path from s to v. Similarly, let Vi ∈ V be the subset of all the vertices in the same layer Li.
Consider the connectivity game on a layer graph G, with a single source vertex s and target vertex t. The Banzhaf index of the edge e is the number of subsets of edges that allow a path between s and t, but do not allow such a path when e is removed (divided by a constant).
According to Lemma 1 , if we iterate
