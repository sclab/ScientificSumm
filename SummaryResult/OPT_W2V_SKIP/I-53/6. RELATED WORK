Our method also differs from [7] in that while [7] presents a method for the case where all the players" weights are distributed normally, our method applies to any type of distribution for these weights.
Also, unlike all the above mentioned work, we provide an analysis of the performance of our method in terms of the percentage error in the approximate Shapley value.
One approach is to use generating functions [3].
The method we propose differs from this in that they define the Shapley value by treating a player '' s number of swings ( if a player can
