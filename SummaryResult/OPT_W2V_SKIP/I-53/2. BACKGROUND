For the former, each coalition is associated with a set of payoff vectors that is not necessarily the set of all possible divisions of some fixed amount.
For each coalition S, the number v(S) is the total payoff that is available for division among the members of S (i.e., the set of joint actions that coalition S can take consists of all possible divisions of v(S) among the members of S).
In this case , a player '' s Shapley value is proportional to the contribution it makes as a member of a coalition ; the more contribution
