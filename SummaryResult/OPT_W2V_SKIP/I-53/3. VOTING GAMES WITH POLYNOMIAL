It is possible for the marginal contribution of this player to be one if it joins a coalition in which the number of type 1 players is between zero and (q − 1)/w1.
In the same way, we obtain the Shapley value of the large party for the general case where ws > 1 as: ϕl = wl/ws /(m + 1) Now consider a small player.
Thus, out of the total (m + 1) possible cases, its marginal contribution is one in wl cases.
