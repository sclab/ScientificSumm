Although this problem is, in general #P-complete, we show that there are some specific voting games for which the Shapley value can be determined in polynomial time and  characterise such games.
In particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game is #P-complete.
Our study shows that the error decreases as 1. a player"s weight increases, 2. the quota increases, and 3. the number of players increases.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique and fair.
Given the fact that software agents have limited computational resources
