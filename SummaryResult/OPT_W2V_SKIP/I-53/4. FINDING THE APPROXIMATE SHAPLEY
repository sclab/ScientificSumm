The average marginal contribution is found in Step 3 - and this is the Shapley value for player i. THEOREM 1.
In Step 2.1, we randomly select a sample SX of size X from the population P. Player i"s marginal contribution to the random coalition SX is found in Step 2.2.
The marginal contribution of player i to this random sample is one if the total weight of the X players in the sample is greater than or equal to a = q −wi but less than b = q − (where is an inifinitesimally small quantity).
Evaluate Shapley value of
