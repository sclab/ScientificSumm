We have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 
We have demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform PageRank.
A qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that Web users, rather than Web authors, visit.
The machine learning component of fRank gives it
