In Figure 1 we show the performance of fRank trained with only the popularity feature set vs. the amount of data we have for the popularity feature set.
Shown is the decrease in accuracy when we train a network that has all but the given set of features.
Table 3 shows the results of this experiment, where the decrease in accuracy is the difference in pairwise accuracy between the network trained with all of the features, and the network missing the given feature set.
For example , the fourth line of the table shows that fRank using the page ,
