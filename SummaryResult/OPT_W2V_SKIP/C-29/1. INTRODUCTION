In this paper, we describe CONFLEX-G, a grid-enabled molecular conformational search program, using OmniRPC and report its performance in a grid of several PC  clusters which are geographically distributed.
In this paper, we propose the OmniRPC persistence model to a Grid RPC system and demonstrate its effectiveness.
Although the parallelized version of CONFLEX was used to calculate in parallel the structure optimization, which takes up over 90% of the processing in the molecular  conformation search, sufficient improvement in the speedup could not be achieved by this method alone.
While some of the most common secondary structures ( e.g. , certain
