We implemented the worker program of CONFLEX-G to receive data, such as evaluation parameters of energy, from a client program and to be initialized by the Initialize function.
In OmniRPC, however, when the  Initialize remote function is defined in the worker program and a new worker program, corresponding to the other RPC, is assigned to execute, an Initialize function is called  automatically.
In other words, the client program can eliminate the initialization for each RPC call, and can therefore optimize trial structures efficiently.
As a result , the worker program can execute efficiently and reduce the amount of data transmitted
