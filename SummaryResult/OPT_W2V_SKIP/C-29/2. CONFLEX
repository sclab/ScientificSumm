When all of the trial structures related to a given initial structure are optimized, only the master  procedure is used in comparison.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which  determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is pre-defined.
2.1 Algorithm of ConformationalSpaceSearch The basic strategy of CONFLEX is an exhaustive search of only the low-energy regions.
Figure 1 shows the outline of CONFLEX, the original  conformational space search algorithm.
