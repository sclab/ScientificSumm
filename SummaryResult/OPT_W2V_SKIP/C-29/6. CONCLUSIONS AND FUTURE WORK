This can eliminate  unnecessary communication and the initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G. CONFLEX-G can achieves performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and exploits more computing resources by allowing the use of multiple PC clusters in the grid.
This feature is especially important in large-scale applications which require lengthy calculation in a grid environment.
We plan to refine the conformational optimization  algorithm in CONFLEX to explore the conformation space search of larger bio-molecules such HIV protease using up to 1000 workers in a grid environment. 
In grid environments in which the environment changes dynamically , it is also necessary to support
