â€¢ In this experiment, we used a simple build-in  roundrobbin scheduler of OmniRPC, which is necessary in order to apply the scheduler that allocates structures with long optimization times to a high-performance Table 8: Statistics of elapsed time of trial structure optimization using 28 workers in the Dennis cluster.
The result of this experiment shows that CONFLEX-G can reduce the execution time as the number of workers increases, as in the MPI version of CONFLEX.
When two or more sets of PC clusters are used , the speedup in performance is hampered by the load imbalance of the optimization of
