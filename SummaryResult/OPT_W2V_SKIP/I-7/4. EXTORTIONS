, xπn ) is a τ-extortion in G given π if and only if there is some benign backward induction f in G∗ given πR with f = (xπn , .
For the type of conditional commitments we have that any  conditional commitment profile f is an extortion of order 0 and an  extortion of an order m greater than 0 is any extortion of order m − 1 for which: gπ1 , .
A conditional commitment profile f is a benign backward induction if it is a benign backward induction of order k for each k with 0 k n. For games with a finite action
