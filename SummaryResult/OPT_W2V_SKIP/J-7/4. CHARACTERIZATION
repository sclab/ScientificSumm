Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with  technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any  sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and the vertices in SB have strategy B.
Then the same sequence of inequalities as in Lemma 4.1 show that AB is a better response than B for π(vi) (although A might be the best response) and so π(vi) switches to either AB or A.
The inequalities for the
