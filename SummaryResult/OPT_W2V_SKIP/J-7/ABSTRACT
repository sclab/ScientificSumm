Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new  technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B.
Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited  compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms.
We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B , and also this additional cost of adopting both , and
