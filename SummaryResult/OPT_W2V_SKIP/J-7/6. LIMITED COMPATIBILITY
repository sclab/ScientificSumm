We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ, there is a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two  incumbent technologies B and C may find it beneficial to increase their compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new  superior technology A.
This is not an equilibrium, since each node of the form u(0, y) now has an incentive to switch from C (generating a payoff of 3.9) to B (thereby generating a payoff of 3.95).
In particular , we consider a situation in which initially , two technologies B and
