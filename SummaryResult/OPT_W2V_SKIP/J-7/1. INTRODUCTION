As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets.
Following [ 13 ] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite ; we further assume that for some natural number Δ , each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset
