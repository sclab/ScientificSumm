For this experiment, the session size is set to 8, the branching factor is set to 16, the propagation mode for SDIMS is Update-Up, and the participant nodes perform continuous probes for the global aggregate value.
Overall , our initial experience with using SDIMS for the PRACTII replication system suggests that ( 1 ) the general aggregation interface provided by SDIMS simplifies the construction of distributed applications-given the low-level PRACTI mechanisms , 388 we were able to construct a basic file system that uses SDIMS for several distinct control tasks in under two weeks and ( 2 ) the weak
