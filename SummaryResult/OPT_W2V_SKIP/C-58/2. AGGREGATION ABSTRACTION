The system associates an aggregation function ftype with each attribute type, and for each level-i subtree Ti in the  system, the system defines an aggregate value Vi,type,name for each  (at380 tributeType, attributeName) pair as follows.
Each physical node in the system is a leaf and each subtree represents a logical group of nodes.
Then the aggregate value for a level-i subtree Ti is the aggregation function for the type , ftype computed across the aggregate values of each of Ti '' s k children : Vi , type , name = ftype ( V0 iâˆ’1 , type ,
