It would be less efficient because each  intermediate virtual node will have to maintain a list of all values at the leaves in its subtree along with their names and it would be less convenient as applications that need an aggregate for a domain will have to pick values of nodes in that domain from the list returned by a probe and perform computation. 
As Figure 4 illustrates , whenever two nodes in a domain share the same prefix with respect to a key and no other node in the domain has a longer prefix , our algorithm introduces a
