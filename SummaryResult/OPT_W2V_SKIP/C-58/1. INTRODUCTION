However, meeting the SDIMS requirements forces a  design to address four questions: (1) How to scalably map different attributes to different aggregation trees in a DHT mesh?
It is interesting to note that although these systems export a global hash table abstraction, many of them internally make use of what can be viewed as a scalable system of aggregation trees to, for example, route a request for a given key to the right DHT node.
A SDIMS should adapt to reconfigurations in a timely fashion and should also provide mechanisms so that applications can tradeoff the cost of adaptation with
