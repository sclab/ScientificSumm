The primary advantage of aggregating metrics in containers is that it allows them to be propagated easily as a cohesive unit through the components of the mobility framework so that they can be delivered to the adaptation engine, as discussed in the following subsection.
Therefore, due to the presence of network communication latency, it is important for the host manager to pass as many metrics as possible to the adaptation engine in one invocation, implying the need to gather these metrics in the host manager, through some form of push or propagation, before sending them to the adaptation engine.
