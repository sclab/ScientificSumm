These results are encouraging since even for the worst case scenario of n=1 the metric collection overhead is an acceptable 20% for a method of 1500ms duration (which is relatively short for a component or service level object in a distributed enterprise class application) with previous work on adaptation showing that such an overhead could easily be recovered by the efficiency gains made by adaptation [5].
Worst case performance characteristics The next step was to determine the percentage metrics collection overhead compared with execution time in order to provide information about the execution characteristics of objects that would be suitable
