Surprisingly, we find that the improvements in latency obtained with one-instantaneous zebroids are independent of the input  distribution of the popularity of the data items.
When the storage is extremely scarce so that only one replica per data item exists in the AutoMata network, the number of replacements performed by the zebroids is zero since any replacement will cause a data item to be lost from the system.
Finally, the analysis captures a  oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.
This is because in the former case , each of these z
