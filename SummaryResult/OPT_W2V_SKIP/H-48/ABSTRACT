While this measures an overall change in performance, it does not directly measure the  effectiveness of IR systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term mismatch between the query and relevant documents, nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query-document term mismatch.
The proposed approach is  attractive because it provides an estimate of system  performance under varying degrees of query-document term  mismatch, it makes use of readily available test collections, and it does not require any additional relevance judgments or any form of manual processing.
