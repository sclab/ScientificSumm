Although not attempted in our experiments, another  application of this evaluation framework would be to remove query terms individually, rather than incrementally, to  analyze which terms (or possibly which types of terms) are being helped most by a QE technique on a particular test collection.
A systematic evaluation of IR systems as outlined in this paper is useful not only with respect to measuring the general success or failure of particular QE techniques in the presence of query-document term mismatch , but it also provides insight into how a particular IR system will perform when used by expert versus non-expert
