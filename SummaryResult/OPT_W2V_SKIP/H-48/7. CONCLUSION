Evaluations of IR systems employing QE performed only on the entire collection do not take into account that the purpose of QE is to mitigate the effects of term mismatch in retrieval.
Further, this evaluation framework is not  metricspecific: information in terms of any metric (MAP, P@10, etc.)
Most importantly, it provides a controlled manner in which to measure the performance of QE with respect to query-document term mismatch.
By systematically removing query terms from relevant documents , we can measure the degree to which QE contributes to a search by showing the difference between the performances of a
