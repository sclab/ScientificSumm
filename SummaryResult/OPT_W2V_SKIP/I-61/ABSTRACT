Finding reliable and adaptive solutions to the flow management problem is of paramount importance if the Next Generation Air Transportation  Systems are to achieve the stated goal of accommodating three times the current traffic volume.
In this paper we use FACET - an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry - to test a multi-agent algorithm for traffic flow management.
This problem is particularly complex as it requires the integration and/or coordination of many factors including : new data ( e.g. , changing weather info ) , potentially conflicting priorities ( e.g. , different
