The flow control problem has to address the integration of policies across these sectors and centers, account for the complexity of the system (e.g., over 5200 public use airports and 16,000 air traffic controllers) and handle changes to the policies caused by weather  patterns.
FACET also allows the user to change the flow patterns of the aircraft through a number of mechanisms, including metering aircraft through fixes.
Two of the fundamental problems in addressing the flow problem are : ( i ) modeling and simulating such a large complex system as the fidelity required to provide reliable results is difficult
