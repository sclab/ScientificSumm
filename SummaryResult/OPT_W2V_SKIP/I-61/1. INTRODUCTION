The Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NGATS) initiative aims to address this issues and, not only account for a threefold increase in traffic, but also for the increasing heterogeneity of aircraft and decreasing restrictions on flight paths.
Finally, in Section 5, we discuss the  implications of these results and provide and map the required work to enable the FAA to reach its stated goal of increasing the traffic volume by threefold. 
Unlike many other flow problems where the increasing traffic is to some extent absorbed by improved hardware ( e.g. , more servers with larger memories and faster CPUs for
