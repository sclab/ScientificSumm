The computation cost of the system evaluation, G  (Equation 1) is almost entirely dependent on the computation of Figure 8: Performance on two congestion problem, with 300 Aircraft, 20 Agents and Î± = .75.
Indeed, the performance of the two D estimates is remarkable in this case as they were obtained with about twenty times fewer computations of k. Furthermore, the two D estimates,  significantly outperform the full D computation for a given number of computations of k and validate the assumptions made in Section 3.4.2.
To verify that the performance improvement of our methods is maintained when there are a
