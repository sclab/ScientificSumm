One such  modification is to extend the definition of agents from fixes to sectors, giving agents more opportunity to control the  traffic flow, and allow them to be more efficient in eliminating congestion.
Finally, in cooperation with domain experts, we are investigating different system evaluation functions, above and beyond the delay and congestion dependent G presented in this paper.
The main contribution of this paper is to present a distributed adaptive air traffic flow management algorithm that can be readily implemented and to test that algorithm using FACET , a simulation tool widely used by the FAA , NASA and
