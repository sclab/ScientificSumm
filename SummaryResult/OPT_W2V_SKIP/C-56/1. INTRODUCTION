The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed  process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled,  structured and localized way.
However, such infrastructures contain  scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13].
Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities.
Among them , WebFlow [ 1 ] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes ; Opera-G [ 3
