Here we can see that our strategy of enhancing the query model by contextual factors is equivalent to document re-ranking, which is used in [5][15][30].
Let us use 0 Qθ to denote the original query model, F Qθ for the feedback model created from feedback documents, Dom Qθ for a domain model and K Qθ for a knowledge model created by applying term relations.
In particular, all the related and presumed words should be included in the query model.
Then the document score in Equation ( 1 ) is extended as follows : ( ) ∑∑∑ ∈∈ ∈
