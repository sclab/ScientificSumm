If maximum likelihood estimation is used directly on these documents, the resulting domain model will contain both  domain-specific terms and general terms, and the former do not emerge.
In this study, we use a simple classification method: the selected domain is the one with which the query"s KL-divergence score is the lowest, i.e.
Therefore, we employ an EM process to extract the specific part of the domain as follows: we assume that the documents in a domain are generated by a domain-specific model (to be extracted) and general language model (collection model).
