Each other node then receives a value propagation message from its parent and chooses the assignment for its domain that has the best utility given the assignments received in the  message.
This dynamic programming based propagation phase  continues until the agent at the root node of the pseudotree has received all messages from its children.
A value propagation message with this assignment is sent to each node in C(Z).
At this point all utilities involving node Y are known, and the domain for Y may be safely eliminated from the joined hypercube.
It has been shown that this size
