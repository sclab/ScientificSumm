We define an edge-traversal based method as any method that produces a pseudotree in which all parent/child pairs share an edge in the original graph.
The bolded node, B, is the merge point for node E. 2.2 Cross-edged Pseudotrees We define a cross-edge as an edge from node X to a node Y that is above X but not in the path from X to the root.
Also defined in [ 6 ] are four types of relationships between nodes exist in a pseudotree : â€¢ P ( X ) - the parent of a node X : the single
