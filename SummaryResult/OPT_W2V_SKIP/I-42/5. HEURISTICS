Improved DFS based heuristics use a special procedure to choose the root node, and also provide an ordering function over the neighbors of a node to determine the order of path recursion.
Each node then proceeds to begin the DCPOP algorithm using its  knowledge of the pseudotree generated by the best heuristic.
The root then broadcasts the total complexity for that heuristic to all nodes.
After each heuristic completes its generation of a pseudotree, we execute the measurement procedure and propagate the  measurement information up to the chosen root in that pseudotree.
Assuming a complexity of O ( V )
