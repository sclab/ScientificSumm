We have already shown that the total number of messages is linear with respect to the number of constraints in the DCOP  instance.
For our tests we generated 100 sample problems for each  combination of agents and meetings.
The values in the first five columns represent (in left to right order), the total number of agents, the total number of meetings, the total  number of variables, the average total number of constraints, and the average minimum IW produced by a traditional pseudotree.
The last three columns show the same metrics we used for the generic DCOP instances , except this
