The proof will show that every execution in Σ besides the execution of the modified order and the last  execution has a matching execution in Σ with a price different by at most s2(Σ), and will use the fact that pmax + s2(Σ) is a bound on the price in Σ .
Since Σ and Σ are at most k apart,we have that by k insertions we change ˜Σ to either Σ or Σ , and by Lemma 5.3 its set of executed orders is at most 2k from each.
We define s2 ( Σ ) to be the maximum
