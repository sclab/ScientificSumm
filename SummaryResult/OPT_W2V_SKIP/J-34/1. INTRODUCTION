After giving specific (worst-case) relative price sequences in which small perturbations  generate large changes in basic statistics (for example, altering the number of shares traded by a factor of two), we proceed to demonstrate that the difference in stability properties of the two models is more than merely theoretical.
Note that such positioning may depend on more complex features of the order books than just the current bid and ask, but the relative model is a natural and simplified starting point.
To examine this question, we consider two stylized but natural models of the limit order arrival process.
We first
