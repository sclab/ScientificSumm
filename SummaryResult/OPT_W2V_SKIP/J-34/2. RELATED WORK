Of particular note for our interests is [3], which  empirically studies the distribution of arriving limit order prices in several prominent markets.
There is also a small but growing number of works  examining market microstructure topics from a computer  science perspective, including some focused on the use of  microstructure in algorithms for optimized trade execution.
(However, see Farmer and Joshi [6] for an example and survey of other price  dynamic stability studies.)
This work takes a view of  arriving prices analogous to our relative model, and establishes a power-law form for the resulting distributions.
