Without this, then for any choice of trade that solves RP1(i), there is another trade with a disjoint set of uncertain but satisfied nodes that provides a  counterexample to RP (Eq.
We show in Proposition 1 that the RP rule is satisfied if and only if π∗ l ≥ π∗ u. Constructing the modified valuation as ˜vi recognizes that there is shared uncertainty across trades that satisfy the same nodes in a bid tree.
Fixing the values in ˜vi on nodes satisfied in L∗ i has the effect of removing this consideration when a trade U∗ i is selected
