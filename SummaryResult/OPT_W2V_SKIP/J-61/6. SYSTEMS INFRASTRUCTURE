We take  advantage of the commonality of these problems by using common LP/MIP builders that differ only by a few functional hooks to provide the correct variables for optimization.
We realized that all of our optimization formulations boil down to two classes of optimization problem.
In addition to the core exchange discussed in this paper, we have developed an agent component that allows a user to simulate the  behavior and knowledge of other players in the system, better allowing a user to formulate their strategy in advance of actual play.
Major exchange tasks are handled by engines that dictate the
