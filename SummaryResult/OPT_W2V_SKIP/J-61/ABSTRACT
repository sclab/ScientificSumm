All computation in the exchange is carefully  optimized to exploit the structure of the bid-trees and to avoid enumerating trades.
These bounds allow price discovery and useful preference elicitation in early rounds, and allow termination with an efficient trade despite partial information on bidder valuations.
A VCG-based payment scheme that has been shown to  mitigate opportunities for bargaining and strategic behavior is used to determine final payments.
The exchange is fully implemented and in a validation phase.
We present the first design for an iterative combinatorial  exchange (ICE).
The exchange incorporates a tree-based bidding language that is concise and expressive
