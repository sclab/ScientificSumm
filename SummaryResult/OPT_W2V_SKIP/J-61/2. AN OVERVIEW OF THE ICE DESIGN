ICE is a hybrid auction design, in that it couples  simple item prices to drive bidding in early rounds with  combinatorial WD and payments, a feature it shares with the clock-proxy design of Ausubel et al.
For now, just observe in this two-agent example that the agents state lower and upper bounds that are checked in the activity rule, and then passed to winner-determination (WD), and then through three stages of pricing (accuracy, fairness, balance).
We adopt a variation on the clock-proxy auctions"s  revealedpreference activity rule.
In computing the prices , we adopt the methods of constraint-generation to
