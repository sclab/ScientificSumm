In this approach, the workloads of selected replica servers are continuously adjusted during data transfers, and we provide a function that enables users to define a final 803 block threshold, according to their data grid environment.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving transfer time and reducing overall idle time spent waiting for the slowest server.
A previous work showed that the dynamic co-allocation scheme leads to performance improvements.
We proposed the Recursive-Adjustment Co-Allocation scheme to improve data transfer performances using the co-allocation architecture in [17].
The co-allocation architecture provides a coordinated agent for assigning data
