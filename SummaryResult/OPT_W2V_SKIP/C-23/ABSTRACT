Several co-allocation strategies have been coupled and used to exploit rate differences among various client-server links and to address dynamic rate fluctuations by dividing files into multiple blocks of equal sizes.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic  coallocation scheme, namely Recursive-Adjustment Co-Allocation scheme, to improve the performance of data transfer in Data Grids.
The co-allocation architecture was developed in order to enable parallel downloading of datasets from multiple servers.
We also provide an effective scheme for reducing the cost of reassembling data blocks.
However , a major obstacle , the idle time of faster servers having to wait for
