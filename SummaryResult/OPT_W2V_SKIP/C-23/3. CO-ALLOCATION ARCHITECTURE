The Aggressive Load Balancing dynamic co-allocation strategy presented in [17] adds functions that change block size de-liveries by: (1) progressively increasing the amounts of data requested from faster servers, and (2) reducing the amounts of data requested from slower servers or ceasing to request data from them altogether.
And it uses GridFTP [1, 11, 16], a reliable, secure, and efficient data transport protocol to provide efficient management and transfer of terabytes or petabytes of data in a wide-area, distributed-resource environment.
In [ 17 ] , the author proposes co-allocation architecture for co-allocating Grid data transfers across multiple connections by exploiting
