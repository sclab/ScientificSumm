In the next experiment, we used the Recursive-Adjustment  CoAllocation strategy with various sets of replica servers and measured overall performances, where overall performance is: Total Performance = File size/Total Completion Time (5) Table 2 lists all experiments we performed and the sets of replica servers used.
These numbers were obtained by transferring files of 500MB, 1000MB, and 2000MB from a single replica server using our GridFTP client tool, and each number is an average over several runs.
The results in Figure 8(a) show that using  coallocation technologies yielded no improvement for smaller file sizes such as 10MB.
These results demonstrate
