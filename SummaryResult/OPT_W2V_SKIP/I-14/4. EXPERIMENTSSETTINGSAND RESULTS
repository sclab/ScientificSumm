4.3 Results analysis and evaluation Figure 3 demonstrates the ARSS(Average Reward per Search Session) versus the number of incoming queries over time for the the Single-Step based Non-learning Algorithm (SSNA), and the Single-Step Learning Algorithm(SSLA) for data collection TREC-VLC-921.
In our experiments, Î» is set as 0.0543 so that the mean of the incoming queries from the environment to the agent network is 50 per time unit.
Moreover , two-phase learning based algorithm is better than single-phase based learning algorithm because the maximal reward an agent can receive from searching its neighborhood within TTL hops is related to
