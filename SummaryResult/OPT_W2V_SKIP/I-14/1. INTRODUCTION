To our best knowledge, this is one of the first reinforcement learning applications in addressing distributed content  sharing problems and it is indicative of some of the issues in applying reinforcement in a complex application.
Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (1) a reinforcement learning based approach for agents to acquire satisfactory routing policies based on estimates of the potential contribution of their neighboring agents; (2) two strategies to speed up the learning process.
This contrasts with the content-similarity based approaches where similar operations are repeated for every incoming query and the processing time keeps largely constant over time
