First, we propose that centralized server-based architectures be made hierarchical through the introduction of communication proxies so that game updates made by clients that are time sensitive, such as movement, can be more efficiently distributed to other players within their game-space.
In summary , we argue that while current authority models that only delegate responsibility to the server to make authoritative decisions on events is more secure than allowing the clients to make the decisions , these types of models add undesirable delays to events that could very well be decided by the clients without any inconsistency being introduced into
