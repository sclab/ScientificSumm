First, we can generate the pheromone fields directly from the observed locations of individual entities, so there is no need for the ghosts to make deposits.
Real-world observations.-Observations from the real world are encoded into the pheromone field each increment of BEE time, as a new current page is generated.
Key elements of the BEE  architecture include the model of an individual agent, the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact, the information sources that guide them, and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute.
Dispositions are relatively stable , and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of
