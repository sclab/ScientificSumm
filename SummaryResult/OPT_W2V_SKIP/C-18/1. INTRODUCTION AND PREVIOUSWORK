That is, systems are being designed and developed to  effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.
Vern Paxson of the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that  human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part, from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior, namely self-reproduction.
In order to understand fully the behavior of such swarms it is necessary to construct a model that explains the behavior of what we
