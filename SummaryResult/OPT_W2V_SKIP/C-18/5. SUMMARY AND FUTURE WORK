Some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be consider are as follows: • Is it possible to apply some of learning concepts  developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way that true emergent behavior takes place?
• Are the current techniques being developed in the  design of Intrusion Detection & CounterMeasure  Systems and Survivable systems effective against this new class of worms?
; and • What techniques, if any, can be developed to create defenses against swarm worms?
