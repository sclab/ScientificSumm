Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were  selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
At the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero.
In the case of a simple local area network of 30  computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected.
The network testbed  consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.
The percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies , where up to 39.7 %
