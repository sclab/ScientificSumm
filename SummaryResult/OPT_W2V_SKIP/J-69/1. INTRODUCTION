While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P  applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing  system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000  simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33].
Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive  techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to  address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires  familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.
We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history
