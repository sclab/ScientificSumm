It is possible that the equilibrium price p∞ of the security F will not be either 0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it.
Note that, by Theorem 1, p∞ is exactly agent i"s conditional expectation of the value of f(x), given her final possibility set S∞ i .
It is well known that f is expressible as a weighted threshold function iff there is a hyperplane in n that separates all the points at which f has value 0 from all the points at which f has value 1
