While it seems reasonable that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if the volume of each user"s trades is not observable; this  depends on the details of the market process.
With real inputs and arbitrary prior  distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an equilibrium in a finite number of steps. 
Up to this point, we have described the model with the same number of agents as bits of information.
Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an information market
