An  inverse O is IP3-safe with respect to CD if it is made from a transformed version of O, which has included all operations in CD that are context-independent of O.
C(O) in Step 2(a) of transform(O, CD)  (Procedure 1), so this condition is no longer explicitly specified in Procedure 2.
285 { O } ; ( 2 ) select all operations from CD which are contextindependent of O and create a new context difference NCD ; ( 3 ) transform O against operations in NCD ( by recursively invoking transform ( ) ) ; ( 4
