4 There is another Inverse Property 1 (IP1) that is required in an OT system for achieving the correct undo effect [21], but IP1 is not related to IT functions.
284 There are generally two ways to achieve OT correctness with respect to these transformation properties: one is to design transformation functions capable of preserving these properties; the other is to design control algorithms capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties.
Given any operation Ox and a pair of operations [ O , O ] , it must be : IT ( IT ( Ox , O )
