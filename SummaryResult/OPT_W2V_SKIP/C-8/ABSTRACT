After having designed, implemented, and experimented with a series of OT algorithms, we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a new  theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems, reducing its complexity, and supporting its continual evolution.
In this paper, we report the main  results of this effort: the theory of operation context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
The theoretical foundation for OT is crucial in determining its capability to solve existing and new problems, as well as the quality of those solutions.
Operational Transformation ( OT ) is a technique for consistency
