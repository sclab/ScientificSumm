They are insufficient because an OT system may need to preserve additional properties/conditions, such as IP2, IP3, and those summarized in [21].
COT is simpler than GOTO-ANYUNDO (and prior OT algorithms based on the causality theory) because of the use of a single theory of operation context for capturing all  OTrelated conditions (CC1-CC6), the uniformity of  contextbased conditions for treating all types of operation, and the conciseness of these context-based conditions.
By  experimentation, we have identified some useful heuristics that are 286 effective in saving transformations for a number of common patterns of operation sequence.
