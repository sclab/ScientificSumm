In this paper, we report the main results of this effort: the theory of operation  context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
This puzzle was solved in various ways, but the theory of causality as well as its limitation were inherited by all follow-up OT algorithms.
After having designed, implemented, and experimented with a series of OT algorithms of increased complexity, we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a uniformed theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems, reducing its complexity, and 279 supporting its continual evolution.
In fact , the causality relation is
