We first present two main  expertise retrieval tasks, along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people.
The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline  expertise retrieval methods applied to the new test set.
The second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic  features of the new test set, such as the organizational structure of the university, and the hierarchical structure of the topics in the test set.
Expertise retrieval models are shown to be robust with respect to environments smaller than the W3C
