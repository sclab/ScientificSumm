The coverage of topics and candidates for the expert finding and profiling tasks,  respectively, is close to 100% in all cases.
8.2 Experimental setup Given that the self-assessments are also sparse in our collection, in order to be able to measure differences between the various  models, we selected a subset of topics, and evaluated (some of the) runs only on this subset.
We managed to improve upon the baseline in all cases, but the improvement is more noticeable for the profiling task.
We find a positive impact of the context models only for expert finding.
For both tasks , the
