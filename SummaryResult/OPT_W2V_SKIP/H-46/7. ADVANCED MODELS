The dependence between two queries is reflected by the SI(q, q ) score, where scores greater than zero indicate that it is likely that there is a dependence, which we take to mean that the queries are likely to be similar: SI(q, q ) = log p(q, q ) p(q)p(q ) (10) We estimate the probability of a topic p(q) using the number of documents relevant to query q within the collection.
That is : p ( q|ca ) =P l∈L λl · p ( ql|ca ) , where L is the set of languages used in the
