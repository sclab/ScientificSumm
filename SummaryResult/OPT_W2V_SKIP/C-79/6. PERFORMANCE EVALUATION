In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.
Delay decreases slightly as the number of nodes increases, due to the fact that the more nodes in the network, the more nodes  receives the advertisement packets which helps the search packet find the target so that the delay of update decreases.
Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates.
In contrast , the packets will
