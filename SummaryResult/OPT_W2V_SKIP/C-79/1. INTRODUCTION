One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P)  system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.
Adopting this paradigm, the whole MANET P2P system operates as a collection of autonomous entities which consist of different types of control packets such as query and advertisement packets.
Query packets are used to  explore a route to other peers holding resources of interest.
However , deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations
