Therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same  destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.
To allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to  forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 The assumption of unique ID is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions.
When a query packet  encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is  returned to the querying node.
