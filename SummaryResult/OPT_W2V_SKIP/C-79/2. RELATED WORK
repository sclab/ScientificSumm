With limited control over how control and data packets are routed in the network, it is difficult to avoid the inefficiency of the general-purpose routing protocols which are often reactive and flooding-based.
Despite the mechanism to reduce control packets, high overhead may still be unavoidable, especially when there are many clients trying to locate different services, due to the fact that the algorithm relies on flooding, For resource replication, Yin and Cao [6] design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for MANETs.
In this way, the number of  control packets on the network is constrained, thus providing good scalability.
