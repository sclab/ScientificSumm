For instance, POMDPs have prohibitively large off-line time requirements for policy computation, but can be readily used in simpler settings to expose beneficial behavioral trends; this can serve as a form of target dynamics that are provided to EMT in a larger domain for on-line operation. 
There is recent interest in using POMDPs in hybrid solutions [17], in which the POMDPs can be used together with other control approaches to provide results not easily achievable with either approach by itself.
The tag game experiment data also revealed the different emphasis DBC and POMDPs place on the formulation of an environment
