As actual system behavior may deviate from that which is specified by target dynamics (due to the stochastic nature of the system), planning in such  environments needs to be continual [4], in a manner similar to classical closed-loop controllers [16].
This is followed by a review of the Extended Markov Tracking (EMT) approach as a DBC-structured control regimen in Section 4.
That section also discusses the limitations of EMT-based control relative to the  general DBC framework.
Experimental data demonstrates that even with a simple model of the environment and a simple design of target dynamics , high success rates can
