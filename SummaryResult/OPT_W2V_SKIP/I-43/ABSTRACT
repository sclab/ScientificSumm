In this paper we introduce Dynamics Based Control (DBC), an approach to planning and control of an agent in stochastic  environments.
We show that a recently developed planning and control approach, Extended Markov Tracking (EMT) is an  instantiation of DBC.
Unlike existing approaches, which seek to optimize  expected rewards (e.g., in Partially Observable Markov Decision  Problems (POMDPs)), DBC optimizes system behavior towards  specified system dynamics.
We exploit this efficiency in a set of experiments that applied  multitarget EMT to a class of area-sweeping problems (searching for moving targets).
We show that such problems can be naturally defined and efficiently solved
