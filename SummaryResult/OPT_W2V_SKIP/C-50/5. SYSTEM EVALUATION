Since the radio module of Mica2 is half-duplex and  assuming that the CPU is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 mA per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15mA per hour.
Also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together.
Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.
Notice that
