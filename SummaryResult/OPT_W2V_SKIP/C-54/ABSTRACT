First, we introduce a client-server architecture where the work is distributed between the server and the  individual clients for spatial query evaluation, data visualization, and data management.
Second, for prolonged periods of access to large online data, we  introduce APPOINT (an Approach for Peer-to-Peer Oï¬„oading the INTernet).
This is a centralized peer-to-peer approach that helps Internet users transfer large volumes of online data efficiently.
We propose two efficient approaches to remote access to large spatial data.
However, interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task.
We enable the minimization of the requirements for system
