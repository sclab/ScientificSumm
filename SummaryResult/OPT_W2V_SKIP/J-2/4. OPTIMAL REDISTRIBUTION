To deal with this, technically, we define the worst-case redistribution percentage as the largest k so that the total amount redistributed is at least k times the total VCG payment, for all bid vectors.
Thus, this mechanism also redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case.
Thus, it seems most natural to compare mechanisms by the percentage of total VCG payment that they redistribute in the worst case.
When n = 6 and m = 1 , for the first example ( Bailey-Cavallo mechanism ) , the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 2 3 ,
