In 2006,  Cavallo [3] pursued exactly this idea, and designed a mechanism that redistributes a large amount of the total VCG payment while maintaining all of the other desirable properties of the VCG mechanism.
each of the n agents receives 1/n of the surplus) will generally result in a mechanism that is not strategy-proof (e.g.
One way of trying to  design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the agents" incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained), and that will maintain the other properties.
