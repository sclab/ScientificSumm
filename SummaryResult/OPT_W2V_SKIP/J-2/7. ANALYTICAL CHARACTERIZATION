, n − 1 is a feasible solution and ˆk ≥ k∗ , then since all the inequalities in Claim 4 are satisfied, we must have ˆxi = x∗ i and ˆk = k∗ .
, n − 1 , the first equation in the above tells us that ( n − m − 1 ) x∗ m+1 = k∗ m. By adding the first two equations , we get ( m + 2 ) x∗ m+1 + ( n − m − 2 ) x∗ m+2 = m By adding the first three equations , we get ( m + 3 ) x∗ m+2
