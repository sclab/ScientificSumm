Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any bid vector, zn ≥ 0.
The mechanism is strategy-proof, because for all i, zi is independent of ˆvi.
If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent always receives a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism is individually rational.
We define the family of linear VCG redistribution  mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms  corresponding to constants ci that satisfy the above constraints (so that the mechanisms will be individually rational and have the no-deficit property).
Since
