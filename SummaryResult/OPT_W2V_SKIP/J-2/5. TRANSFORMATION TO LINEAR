By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, .
, n−1 (when m + 2 > n − 1, this set of equalities is empty) qn = −(n − 1)cn−1 By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, .
, n. Because ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to Qm+1ˆvm+1 + Qm+2ˆvm+2 + .
, n − 1 Qn = (n − 1)cn−1 By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 Qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, .
We also have n − j
