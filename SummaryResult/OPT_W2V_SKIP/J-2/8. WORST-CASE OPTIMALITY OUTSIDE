These bid vectors together with the non-deficit constraint and worst-case constraint produce the above set of  inequalities: for example, when j = m + 1, we consider the bid vector ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ m + 1 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
Now, let us consider the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
Consider the bid vector where ˆvi = xi for i ≤ k + 1, and ˆvi = 0 for all other i, where the xi are  arbitrary numbers satisfying x1 ≥ x2 ≥ .
Now , in this bid vector , the lowest
