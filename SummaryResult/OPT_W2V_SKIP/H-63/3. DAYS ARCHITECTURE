DAYS has been conceptualized to disseminate topical and  nontopical data to users in a local broadcast space and to accept queries from individual users globally.
The DAYS architecture [12] as shown in figure 1 consists of a Data Server, Broadcast Scheduler, DAYS Coordinator, Network of LEO satellites for global data delivery and a Local broadcast space.
The other is a comparatively lightly loaded queue consisting of locally uploaded queries.
Data is pushed into the local broadcast space so that users may tune into the wireless channels to access the data.
