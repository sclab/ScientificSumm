As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.
We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the length of broadcast increases.
This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.
Tuning time for a data item involves 1 unit of time required to access the major index plus time required to access the data
