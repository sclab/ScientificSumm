A natural question is to determine whether a market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances this may occur.
We may consider a market to be in computational  equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find a strategy that increases utility.
153 • How to choose securities; that is, deciding on what collection of boolean formulas to offer to trade, subject to constraints or penalties on the number or complexity of bids.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have analyzed the computational complexity of  matching for securities based on logical formulas.
