This disjunction bid is part of a match iff p +P i qi ≥ k. Evaluating whether this condition is satisfied by a subset of bids is quite straightforward.
Suppose, for example, that bids are limited to unit  quantities of securities of the following two forms: 1.
The atomic securities are sold by insurers, each of whom  specialize in a different form of disaster cause. 
For example, the disjunctions may  correspond to insurance customers, who want an insurance  contract to cover all the potential causes of their asset loss.
The logical question to ask in light of these complexity results
