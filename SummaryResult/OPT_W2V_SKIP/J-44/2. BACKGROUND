In both families of algorithms, neighborhoods are formed by first computing the similarity between all pairs of users (for user-based) or items (for item-based).
[3] discuss a number of rank accuracy measures, which range from Kendall"s Tau to measures that consider the fact that users tend to only look at a prefix of the list [5].
We consider a user-based algorithm based on that defined for GroupLens [11] with variations from Herlocker et al.
Similarity computed in this manner is typically scaled by a factor proportional to the number of common ratings , to reduce the chance of
