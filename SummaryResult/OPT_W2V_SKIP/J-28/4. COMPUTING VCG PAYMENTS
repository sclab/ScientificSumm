4.2 Improved Approximation Scheme Our improved approximation scheme for the winner-determination problem without agent i uses the fact that elements in F (i − 1) and B (n − i) are sorted; specifically, both, unscaled cost and quantity (i.e.
To compute C(I \ i), we iterate over all the possible midrange  tuples and use the corresponding forward and backward tables to compute the locally optimal solution using the above scheme.
This will be a component in computing an approximation to C(I \ i), the value of the solution to the generalized knapsack without bids from agent i.
