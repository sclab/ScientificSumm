Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20].
The new representation Z is ensured to capture both the structures of the link matrix A and the content matrix C. Once we find the optimal Z, we can apply the traditional classification or clustering methods on vectorial data Z.
The new approximating form ËœA = ZUZ puts a clear meaning that the links are between the same set of objects,  represented by features Z.
The idea of link matrix factorization
