In this paper, we study the problem of how to combine the  information of content and links for web page analysis, mainly on  classification application.
We propose a simple approach using factors to model the text content and link structure of web pages/documents.
By sharing  factors between text content and link structure, it is easy to combine both the content information and link structure.
We also discuss an extension for clustering application.
The directed links are generated from the linear combination of linkage of between source and destination factors.
Our experiments show our approach is effective for classification.
