Actually, squared loss does not precisely describe the underlying noise model, because the weights of adjacency matrix can only take nonnegative  values, in our case, zero or one only, and the components of  content matrix C can only take nonnegative integers.
As the example with nonnegative constraints shown in Section 3, we represent each cluster by a latent topic, i.e.
(9), we can obtain more interpretable results, which could be used for clustering. 
The values of the entries are the weights of linear model, instead of the probabilities of web pages belonging to latent  topics.
Then the problem of Eq
