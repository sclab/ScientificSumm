Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.
Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using  cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.
From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.
In our model , we connect two components through a set of shared factors , that is , the latent factors in the second component ( for contents )
