However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.
Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.
Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.
As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.
By applying gossip and FM
