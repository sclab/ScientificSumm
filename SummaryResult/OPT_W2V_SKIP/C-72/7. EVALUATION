These improvements carry over to a PLRG topology as well (as shown in Figure 4(c)), where IRWP is 1.33 times faster than random walk.
Although random walk and IRWP both use k random walks (in our simulations k = number of nodes), IRWP initiates walks only from  updated nodes (as explained in Section 5.2), resulting in faster information convergence.
In each run of the simulation, we induce a change in the measured signal at one or more devices.
We study the improvements of our  incremental gossip protocols over standard gossiping in two  dimensions: execution time and network overhead.
