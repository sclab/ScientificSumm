We focus on the problem of sharing RF spectrum data among a collection of wireless devices.
The inherent requirements of such data and the time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this problem both interesting and technically challenging.
Such radios must coordinate with each other to build an accurate and consistent map of spectral  utilization in their surroundings.
We outline an initial solution incorporating these ideas and also show how our approach reduces network overhead by up to a  factor of 2.4 and results in up to 2.7 times faster information convergence than alternative approaches.
