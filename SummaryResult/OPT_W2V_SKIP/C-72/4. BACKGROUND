This  aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the  network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e.
Double-counting is a well known problem in this process, where nodes may contribute more than once to the aggregate, causing inaccuracy in the final result.
Although such aggregates are very compact in nature,  requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.
