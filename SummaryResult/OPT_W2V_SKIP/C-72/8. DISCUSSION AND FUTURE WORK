One challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.
The trade-offs of different approaches to implementing GUESS is a subject of future work. 
Weighted Readings: Although we argued that most devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing  equipment, there may be situations where there are some special infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than others.
Deciding if a change is significant can be done using a significance threshold Î², below which any  observed change is not propagated by the node.
As well , we also
