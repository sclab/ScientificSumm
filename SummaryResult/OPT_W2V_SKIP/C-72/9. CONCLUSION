We propose GUESS, an approximate yet low overhead approach to perform efficient coordination between cognitive radios.
The fundamental contributions of GUESS are: (1) an FM aggregation scheme for efficient  innetwork aggregation, (2) a randomized gossiping approach which provides exponentially fast convergence and  robustness to network alterations, and (3) incremental variations of FM and gossip which we show can reduce the  communication time by up to a factor of 2.7 and reduce network overhead by up to a factor of 2.4.
Spectrum sensing is a key requirement for dynamic  spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks.
