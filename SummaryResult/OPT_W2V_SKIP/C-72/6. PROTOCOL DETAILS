This is different from the protocol discussed above where only  updated nodes initiate random walks.
Due to the cumulative nature of FM, even if all devices have not converged, the next update will include all previous updates.
We continue with the example from Section 5.1, where we wish to perform coordination between a group of wireless devices to compute the average signal level in a particular frequency band.
