Let us now consider the case that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more important (designated by +l) or less important (-1) due to any of the above sensitivity constraints.
Figure 1 a) shows a generic utility function describing the  applicationlevel Quality of Service (QoS) dependent on the percentage of packets lost.
Under the loss of 50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely between the case where the 50% of the frames with high perceptual importance are received and the tax where the 50% less important frames are received.
While it has been proposed to
