We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss.
We show that  significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually  identical to best effort in the long term.
For voice this utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal  playout is interrupted.
