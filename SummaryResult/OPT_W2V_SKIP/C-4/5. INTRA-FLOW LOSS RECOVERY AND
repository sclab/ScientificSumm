The results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that, while the loss of some of the +l packets has some  measurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be considered to be very low. 
Thus, seen over time intervals which are long compared to the +1/-l burst times, the mean loss for the flow will be equal to the best effort case (Eq.
This also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a minor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained.
As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision ( protect the packet or not
