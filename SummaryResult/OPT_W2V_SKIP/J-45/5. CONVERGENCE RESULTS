Then ˆθ is a consistent estimator of θ∗ if W (N(θ), θ) is defined as a supremum, infimum, or  expectation over the set of Nash equilibria.
Now, let Nn denote all Nash equilibria of the game Γn and let Nδ = [ x∈N BS(x, δ), that is, the union of open balls of radius δ with centers at Nash equilibria of Γ.
We first note that the function (s) is continuous in a finite game.
We will now show that in the special case when Θ and A are finite and each Γθ has a unique Nash equilibrium , the
