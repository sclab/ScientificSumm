When the game is finite (i.e., A and I are both finite), the probability that a ∈ A is played under s is written s(a) = s(ai, a−i).
We can extend this definition to mixed strategies by assuming that ui are von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utilities as follows: ui(s) = Es[ui], where Es is the expectation taken with respect to the probability distribution of play induced by the players" mixed strategy s. 2 By employing the normal form, we model agents as playing a  single action, with decisions taken simultaneously.
To accommodate this , we use a−i to
