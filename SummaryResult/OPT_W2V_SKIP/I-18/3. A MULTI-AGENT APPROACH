In the sequel, we will note Rt si the set of the requests that are known by agent si at time t ∈ T. For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value.
3.4 Problem formalization Then , our problem is the following : we would like each agent to build
