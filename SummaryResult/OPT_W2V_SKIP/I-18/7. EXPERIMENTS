For each scenario, six simulations have been performed: one with centralized planning (all requests are planned by the ground station before the simulation), one where agents are isolated (they cannot communicate nor coordinate with one another), one informed simulation (agents only  communicate requests) and three other simulations implementing the instanciated collaboration strategies (politics): - neutral politics: α, and λ are set to average values; - drastic politics: α and λ are set to higher values, i.e.
The informed simulation reduces the number of redundancies but sligthly increases the  average cost for the same reason.
In the general case , using communication
