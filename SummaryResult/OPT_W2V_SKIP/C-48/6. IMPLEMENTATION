On this testbed, we inserted queries and events from a  single designated node.
Our next step in the implementation is to port DIMs to the Mica motes, and integrate them into the TinyDB [17] sensor database engine on motes.
Finally, Figure 18 shows the total number of messages required for different query sizes on our testbed.
