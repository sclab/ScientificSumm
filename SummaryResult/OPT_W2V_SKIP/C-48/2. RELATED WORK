Unlike these approaches, in our work the data generated at a node are hashed (in general) to different  locations.
More recent work in the Internet context has addressed support for range queries in DHT systems [1, 12], but it is unclear if these directly translate to the sensor network context.
Finally, our work is most close related to data-centric storage [23] systems, which include geographic hash-tables (GHTs) [20], DIMENSIONS [7], and DIFS [10].In a GHT, data is hashed by name to a location within the network,  enabling highly efficient rendezvous.
Examples of such systems , of course , are
