Many of these attributes have scalar values, so one natural way to query events of interest is to use a  multidimensional range query.
Such queries are useful for correlating events occurring within the network.
In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are  sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, even for moderately sized network.
In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed  index that scalably supports multi-dimensional range queries.
Our distributed index for multi-dimensional data ( or DIM ) uses a novel geographic embedding of
