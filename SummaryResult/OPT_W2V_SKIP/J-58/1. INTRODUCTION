We complement this existence theorem with a general framework to design such a payment scheme P. Furthermore, we present general techniques to compute the payment when the output is a composition of the outputs of subgames through the operators or and and; through round-based combinations; or through intermediate results, which may be themselves computed from other subproblems.
More generally, we study how to design truthful mechanisms for binary demand games where the allocation of an agent is either selected or not selected.
The Internet is a complex distributed system where a multitude of heterogeneous agents cooperate to achieve some common
