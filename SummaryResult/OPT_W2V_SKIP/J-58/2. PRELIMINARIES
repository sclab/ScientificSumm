Throughout this paper, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, the setting S of the game is fixed and we are only interested in how to design P for a given allocation rule O.
In addition, the binary demand game studied here is different from the traditional packing IP"s: we only require that the allocation to each agent is binary and the  allocation rule satisfies a certain monotonicity property; we do not put any restrictions on the objective function.
Here the payment pi(Â·) is the money given to agent i and depends on the strategies used by the agents.
