The ASAP method remains consistently close to the optimal, even as the number of robber types increases.
The third set of graphs, shown in Figure 3 shows the effect of the multiset size on runtime in seconds (left column) and reward (right column), again expressed as the reward received by the security agent in the patrolling game, and not a percentage of the optimal Figure 2: Reward for various algorithms on problems of 3 and 4 houses.
Based on our experiments we present three sets of graphs to demonstrate ( 1 ) the runtime of ASAP compared to other common
