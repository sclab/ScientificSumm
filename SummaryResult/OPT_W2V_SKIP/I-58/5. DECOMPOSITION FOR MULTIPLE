We will show that ql , al and xi = P j∈Q z1 ij are feasible for (7) with the same  objective value.
Using this modified notation, we characterize the optimal  solution of follower l"s problem given the leaders k-uniform policy x, with the following optimality conditions: X j∈Q ql j = 1 al − X i∈X 1 k Cl ijxi ≥ 0 ql j(al − X i∈X 1 k Cl ijxi) = 0 ql j ≥ 0 Again, considering only optimal pure strategies for follower l"s problem we can linearize the complementarity constraint above.
We denote by x
