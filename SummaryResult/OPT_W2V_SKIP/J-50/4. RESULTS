If candidate c was the ith candidate to be eliminated (that is, there were m − i + 1 candidates remaining before c"s elimination), it follows that at most n/(m − i + 1) voters had candidate c as their most preferred candidate among the remaining candidates, and thus the number of bits to be communicated after the elimination of the ith candidate is O((n/(m−i+1)) log m).7 Thus, the total communication in this communication protocol is O(n log m + m−1 i=1 (n/(m − i + 1)) log m).
