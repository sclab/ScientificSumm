Therefore, technically, we do not prove the lower bound for (number of candidates, number of voters) pairs (m, n) that do not satisfy these assumptions (for  example, if we make the above assumption, then we technically do not prove the lower bound for any pair (m, n) in which n is even).
For the purposes of this paper, we will consider a nondeterministic protocol correct if for every input vector, there is some  sequence of nondeterministic choices the players can make so that the players know the value of f when the protocol  terminates.
Nevertheless , we always prove the
