The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.
This is an initial work, and further analyses could be  performed.
DEVELOPMENTS The contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing AP values; • we propose a novel method to analyse TREC data; • the method applied on TREC data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.
Our method of analysis , as described in this paper , can be applied only a posteriori , i.e. , once we have all the
