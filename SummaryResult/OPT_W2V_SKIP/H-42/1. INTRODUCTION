Some indicators (and the corresponding algorithms that compute them) have been found useful in this respect, and are nowadays well known: Inlinks (the number of links to a Web page), PageRank [7], and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) [5].

We then apply  analysis methods originally developed for search applications to the resulting network.
