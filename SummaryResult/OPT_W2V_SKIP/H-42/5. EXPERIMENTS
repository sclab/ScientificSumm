This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).
We now turn to discuss if these indicators are meaningful and useful in practice, and how they correlate with standard measures used in TREC.
In this respect, it is interesting to see what happens if we use a different measure from MAP (and AAP).
5a and 5b demonstrate the high correlation between
