We propose and develop localization techniques based on four types of constraints: node color, neighbor information,  deployment time for a node and deployment location for a node.
An image processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes.
The problem of localization in wireless sensor networks where nodes do not use ranging hardware, remains a  challenging problem, when considering the required location  accuracy, energy expenditure and the duration of the  localization phase.
In this paper we propose a framework, called StarDust, for wireless sensor network localization based on passive optical components.
We evaluate the performance of a localization
