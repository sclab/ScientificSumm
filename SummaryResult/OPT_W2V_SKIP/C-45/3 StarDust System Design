The support for the label λk of sensor node ni , resulting from the interaction ( i.e. , within radio range ) with sensor node nj is given by : Qs ni ( λk ) = M ∑ m=1 gλkλm Ps nj ( λm ) ( 6 ) As a result , the localization algorithm ( Algorithm 3 consists of the following steps : all labels are assigned to each sensor node ( lines 1-3 of the algorithm ) , and implicitly each label has a probability initialized to Pni ( λk ) = 1/|Λ| ; in each iteration ,
