To address these challenges, we propose a framework for WSN localization, called StarDust, in which the  complexity associated with the node localization is completely  removed from the sensor node.
We propose a constraint-based label relaxation algorithm for mapping node IDs to the  locations, and four constraints (node, connectivity, time and space), which are building blocks for very accurate and very fast localization systems.
Among these open problems is sensor node  localization, i.e., how to find the physical position of each sensor node.
Section 2 is an overview of the state of art.
We evaluate the performance of a localization system
