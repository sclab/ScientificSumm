It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques.
We assume that 50 unique color filters can be manufactured, that the sensor network is deployed from 2,400 ft  (necessary for the time-constrained relaxation) and that the time required for reporting connectivity grows linearly, with an initial reporting period of 160sec, as used in a real world tracking application [1].
The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows
