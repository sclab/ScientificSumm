The difference: Figure  10Figure 11 Higher quality (better mirrors) would translate in more  accurate image processing (better sensor node detection) and smaller form factor for the optical component (an array of CCRs with a smaller area can be used).
The CCRs that we used were inexpensive, plastic molded, night time warning signs commonly available on bicycles, as shown in Figure 9(b).
The self-righting capabilities are necessary in order to orient the CCR predominantly upwards.
The Central device of the StarDust system consists of the following : the Light Emitter - we used a common-off-theshelf flash light ( QBeam ,
