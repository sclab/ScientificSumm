The business  processes in each workload are assigned to service providers, and each provider"s completion time is calculated based on the service  agreement guarantee using the parameters mentioned in Section 3.1, namely the unloaded completion time α, the maximum  concur32 rency β, and a coefficient γ that controls the linear performance degradation under heavy load.
Note that the evaluation function can be easily replaced if desired; for example, other evaluation functions can model different service provider guarantees or  parallel workflows. 
Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows , it may be that
