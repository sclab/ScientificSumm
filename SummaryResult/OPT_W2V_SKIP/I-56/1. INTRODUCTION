2.1 DCSP Agent Model In general, all DCSP agents must cooperatively interact, and essentially perform the assignment and reassignment of domain values to variables to resolve all constraint violations.
As with an agent, a constraint can also be associated with a priority value.
The search can be realized via a negotiation mechanism (or algorithm) by which the agents follow a high level protocol prescribing the rules of interactions, using a set of strategies devised to select their own preferences at each negotiation step.
In order to engage in cooperative behavior , a DCSP agent needs five fundamental parameters , namely
