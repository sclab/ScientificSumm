In addition to the above two static algorithms we consider the following algorithms for dynamic caching: • LRU: A standard LRU algorithm, but many posting lists might need to be evicted (in order of least-recent usage) until there is enough space in the memory to place the currently accessed posting list; • LFU: A standard LFU algorithm (eviction of the  leastfrequently used), with the same modification as the LRU; • Dyn-QtfDf: A dynamic version of the QtfDf  algorithm; evict from the cache the term(s) with the lowest fq(t) fd(t) ratio.
For the dynamic algorithms , we load
