Our results show that for centralized and LAN environments, there is an optimal allocation of caching query results and caching of posting lists, while for WAN scenarios in which network time prevails it is more important to cache query results.
We also propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists that  outperforms previous static caching algorithms as well as dynamic algorithms such as LRU and LFU, obtaining hit rate values that are over 10% higher compared these strategies.
We present a framework for the analysis of the trade-off between caching query results and caching posting lists , and
