To simulate a realistic scenario, we use the first 6 (3) weeks of the query stream for computing query term frequencies and the following 9 (12) weeks to estimate the hit rate.
The high correlation among the query term frequencies during different time periods explains the graceful adaptation of the static caching algorithms to the future query stream.
