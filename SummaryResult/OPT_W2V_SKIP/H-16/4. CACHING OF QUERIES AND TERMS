First, it captures the amount of locality of queries and terms in a sequence of queries.
The distance in the plot is measured in the number of distinct queries  separating a query and its repetition, and it considers only queries appearing at least 10 times.
The maximum frequency after caching is less than 1% of the maximum frequency before the cache, thus showing that the cache is very effective in reducing the load of frequent queries.
We show in Section 5 that caching a small fraction of terms , while accounting for terms appearing in many documents , is potentially
