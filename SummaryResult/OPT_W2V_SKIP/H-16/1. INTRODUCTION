We provide algorithms based on the Knapsack problem for  selecting the posting lists to put in a static cache, and we show improvements over previous work, achieving a hit ratio over 90%; • Changes of the query distribution over time have little impact on static caching.
We provide a framework for the analysis of the trade-off between static caching of query answers and posting lists; • Static caching of terms can be more effective than  dynamic caching with, for example, LRU.
In such a setting , to achieve a fast response time and to increase the query throughput , using
