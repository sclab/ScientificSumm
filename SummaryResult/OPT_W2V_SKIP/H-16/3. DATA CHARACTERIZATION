We measured the correlation between the document frequency of terms in the collection and the number of queries that contain a particular term in the query log to be 0.424.
The x-axis represents the normalized frequency rank of the query or term.
In this figure, the query frequencies were computed as they appear in the logs with no  normalization for case or white space.
