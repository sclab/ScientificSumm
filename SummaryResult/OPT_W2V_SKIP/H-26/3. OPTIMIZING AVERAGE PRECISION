The difference in the value of H for these two rankings is exactly δj(i, i + 1).
In other words, the  algorithm maximizes H for each non-relevant document, d¯x j , Algorithm 2 Finding the Most Violated Constraint (argmax H) for Algorithm 1 with ∆map 1: Input: w, Cx , C¯x 2: sort Cx and C¯x in descending order of wT φ(x, d) 3: sx i ← wT φ(x, dx i ), i = 1, .
In order for the solution to be feasible , the jth non-relevant document must be ranked after the first j − 1 non-relevant documents , thus satisfying
