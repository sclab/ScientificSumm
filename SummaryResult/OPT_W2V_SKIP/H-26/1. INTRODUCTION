The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea.
The second common approach is to learn a function that maximizes a surrogate measure.
As a  result, finding good probabilities requires solving a more  difficult problem than necessary, likely requiring more training data to achieve the same MAP performance.
Performance measures  optimized include accuracy [17, 15], ROCArea [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 21] or modifications of ROCArea [4], and NDCG [2, 3].
In this paper , we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that
