We computed the scores of these five retrieval methods over the three indices, giving 15 base functions in total.
We ran our main experiments using four choices of F: the set of aforementioned Indri retrieval functions for TREC 9 and TREC 10, and the Web Track submissions for TREC 9 and TREC 10.
For both TREC 9 and TREC 10, we used the  description portion of each query and scored the documents using five of Indri"s built-in retrieval methods, which are Cosine Similarity, TFIDF, Okapi, Language Model with Dirichlet Prior, and Language Model with Jelinek-Mercer Prior.
