Tables 9 and 10 present the results of SVM∆ map, SVM∆ roc, and SVMacc when trained on the Indri retrieval functions and TREC  submissions, respectively.
Table 11 shows the performance of the models when trained on the TREC submissions with the best submission removed.
Given that many of these submissions use scoring functions which are carefully crafted to achieve high MAP, it is possible that the best performing submissions use techniques which subsume the techniques of the other submissions.
The W/L columns show the number of queries where SVM∆ map achieved a higher MAP score.
Models were trained using a
