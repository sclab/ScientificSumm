Although techniques for adjusting query term weights exist for vector space models[17] and probablistic relevance models[9], most of the aforementioned works do not use them, choosing to just append feedback terms to the original query (thus using equal weights for them), which can lead to poorer retrieval performance.
First , when we choose terms to present to the user for relevance judgment , we not only consider single-term value ( e.g. , the relative frequency of a term in the top documents , which can be measured by metrics such as Robertson Selection Value and Simplified Kullback-Leibler Distance
