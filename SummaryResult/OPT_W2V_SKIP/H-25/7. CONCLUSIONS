First, we want to study whether the use of various contexts can help the user to better identify term relevance, while not sacrificing the simplicity and compactness of term feedback.
We could, for example, allow the user to dynamically modify terms in a  language model learned from feedback documents. 
Second, currently all terms are presented to the user in a single batch.
We found the best-performing algorithm to be TCFB, which  benefits from the combination of directly observed term evidence with TFB and indirectly learned cluster relevance with CFB.
We could instead consider iterative term feedback , by presenting a
