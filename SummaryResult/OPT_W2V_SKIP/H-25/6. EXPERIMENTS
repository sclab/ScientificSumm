On the other hand, If the user had correctly checked all such relevant terms, the performance of our algorithms would have increased a lot, as shown in Table 5.
We see that TFB gets big improvement when there is an  oracle who checks all relevant terms, while CFB meets a bottleneck around MAP of 0.325, since all it does is adjust cluster weights, and when the learned weights are close to being accurate, it  cannot benefit more from term feedback.
The total number of presented terms ( M ) is fixed at 48 , so by comparing the performance
