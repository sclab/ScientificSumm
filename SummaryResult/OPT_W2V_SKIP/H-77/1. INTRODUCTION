(1) Comparison between models: among the models above, which model performs best for title extraction; (2) Generality of model: whether it is possible to train a model on one domain and apply it to another domain, and whether it is possible to train a model in one language and apply it to another language; (3) Usefulness of extracted titles: whether extracted titles can improve document processing such as search.
We conclude that we can indeed conduct reliable title extraction from general documents and use the extracted results to improve real applications.
They mainly used linguistic features in the model.1 In
