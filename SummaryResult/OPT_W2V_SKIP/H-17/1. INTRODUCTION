One natural solution to this problem is to create a small index on a subset of the documents that are likely to be returned as the top  results (by using, for example, the pruning techniques in [7, 20]) and compute the first batch of answers using the pruned index.
Since the users are interested in a small number of results ( and thus are viewing a small portion of the index for every query that they issue ) , using an index that is capable of returning all the results for a query may constitute a significant waste in terms
