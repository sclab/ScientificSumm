More specifically, we apply the algorithm HS of Figure 6 to our full index IF and create a keyword-pruned p-index IP of size s. For the construction of our keyword-pruned p-index we used the query frequencies observed during the first 10 days of our data set.
Based on this figure, we can see that our document pruning algorithm performs well across the scale of index sizes s: for all index sizes larger than 40%, we can guarantee the correct answer for about 70% of the queries.
From the figure , we can see that the optimal index size s =
