Our contribution is a  number of modifications in the pruning techniques for creating the pruned index and a new result computation algorithm that  guarantees that the top-matching pages are always placed at the top search results, even though we are computing the first batch from the pruned index most of the time.
While this approach can improve performance by reducing the size of the index , if we compute the top results only from the pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in the result quality : if a document should be in the top results but was not
