Accordingly, Eq.1 can be simplified as follows: )3(),(log 1 ),( )( , ∑∈ −= LTD titsLQ Kt i DQP K DQH Unfortunately, weighted entropy ),(, tsLQ DQH i computed by Eq.3, which represents the amount of information about how likely the top ranked documents in L would be relevant to query Qi on average, cannot be compared across different queries, making it inappropriate for directly predicting query performance.
Now we introduce our performance predictor WIG which is the weighted information gain [ 13 ] computed as the difference between ) , ( , tsLQ DQH i and ) , ( , CQH
