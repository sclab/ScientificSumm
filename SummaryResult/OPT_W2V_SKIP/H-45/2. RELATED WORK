Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].
In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.
One of our prediction models, WIG, is related to the Markov random field (MRF) model for information retrieval [8].
Next we review some representative models.
The superiority of WIG over other prediction
