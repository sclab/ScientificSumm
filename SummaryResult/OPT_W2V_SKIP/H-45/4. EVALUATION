In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).
We discover that our methods generalize well on TB06-adhoc while the correlation for the clarity score with retrieval performance on this data set is considerably worse.
We find that the robustness score, though originally proposed for performance prediction, is a good indicator of query types.
We choose WIG to deal with this case because it shows good prediction accuracy
