Existing solutions to these two problems require that a  performance model for an application is known.
One important problem in grid computing is resource selection, that is, finding an appropriate resource set for the application.
We evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the Grid.
This approach  allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded WAN links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant performance improvements.
Another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid  environment.
During the application run , we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and deduce
