We simulated that the uplink to one of the clusters was overloaded and the bandwidth on this uplink was reduced to approximately 100 KB/s.
Adaptation reduces the iteration time by a factor of 3 (Scenario 1a), 1.7 (Scenario 1b) and 1.2 (Scenario 1c) which allows us to conclude that the gains in the total runtime would be even bigger if the application were run longer than for 15 iterations.
After removing one of the clusters, since some of the  processors are slower (approximately 5 times), the weighted average efficiency raises only to around 40%.
