For requesting new nodes, the Zorilla (9) system is used - a peer-to-peer supercomputing middleware which allows  straightforward allocation of processors in multiple clusters and/or  supercomputers.
Zorilla provides locality-aware scheduling, which tries to allocate processors that are located close to each other in terms of communication latency.
In the future, we are planning to integrate our adaptation component with GAT (3) which is becoming a  standard in the grid community and KOALA (15) a scheduler that  provides co-allocation on top of standard grid middleware, such as the Globus Toolkit (11). 
The  coordinator is implemented as a separate process.
