As the number of available grid resources increases, the accuracy of this approach diminishes, as the subset of possible resource sets that can be examined in a reasonable time becomes smaller.
Finally, performance degradation detection is suitable only for iterative applications and cannot be used for  irregular computations such as search and optimization problems.
Another disadvantage of these systems is that the performance degradation detection is suitable only for iterative or regular applications.
Processor clock speed , average load and a number of processors in a cluster ( Cactus ) are used to rank resources and the resource with
