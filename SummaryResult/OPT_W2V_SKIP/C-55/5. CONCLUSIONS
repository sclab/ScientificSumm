We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.
Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.

It is built upon a flexible and extensible
