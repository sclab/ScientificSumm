The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the user"s locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.
The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.
For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.
All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes , which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes
