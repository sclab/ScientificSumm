Instead, the mechanism is a continuous scheme that accepts bids as they arrive and makes allocation decisions immediately, thus removing any need to clear auctions.
Strategyproofness or, minimally, making the system hard to manipulate is also key given the behavior we have observed.
Finally, another approach to eliminating S4 is to modify the greedy algorithm such that if users do have bids whose allocations could overlap in time, then those potential  allocations are considered from lowest to highest value per node hour.
The challenge is that the current literature is still restricted to non-combinatorial settings. 
With this in mind ,
