We made this decision mainly  because designing a strategyproof mechanism remains an open, challenging problem and we wanted to deploy a working  system and gain experience with real users to address our three goals in a timely manner.
Deploying a non-strategyproof mechanism also had the benefit of testing rationality and seeing how and to what extent users would try to game the system.
Finally, we wanted to identify what other practical problems would emerge in a deployment of a market based system.
In designing and deploying Mirage, we had three primary goals.
The system , which employs a repeated combinatorial
