The direct and random protocols for one-hour TTL had delivery ratios that were too low to be visible in the plot.
For direct delivery, random, and the probability-based routing protocols, relatively few messages were delivered for short TTLs, so many messages expired before they could reach their destination; those messages had infinite delivery delay and were not included in the median or mean measurements.
4.4 Metrics We define a set of metrics that we use in evaluating routing protocols in opportunistic networks : â€¢ delivery ratio , the ratio of the number of messages delivered to the number of total
