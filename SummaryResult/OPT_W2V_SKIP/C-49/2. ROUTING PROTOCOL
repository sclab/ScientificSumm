2.3 Random Routing An obvious approach between the above two extremes is to  select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.
DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their  transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy.
Thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers  messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes.
A node may be in contact with several other nodes
