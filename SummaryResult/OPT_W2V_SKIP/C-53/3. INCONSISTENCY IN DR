Figure 1 illustrates the paths of the shared entity at local site and remote site in x axis by using GS-DR. At the beginning, the positions of the shared entity are the same at sites i and j and the velocity of the shared entity is 0.
At time point t2, the state update reaches site j, and the received state and the time deviation between time points t1 and t2 are used to calculate the current position of the shared entity.
At time point t1 , site i finds that the difference is larger than the threshold and it
