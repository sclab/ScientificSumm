Compared with GS-DR, GS-DR-LL can decrease more inconsistency, and it eliminates most inconsistency when the network transmission delay is 100 ms and the threshold is 4 pixels or 5 degrees.
The 5th Workshop on Network & System Support for Games 2006 - NETGAMES 2006 5 From all above results, it can be indicated that GS-DR and  GSDR-LL both can eliminate after inconsistency, and GS-DR-LL can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.
In the last step, to each track couple, the inconsistency between them was calculated, and the unit of inconsistency was pixel.
the lag is larger than
