If S is a tuple of strategies, one for each agent, and x ∈ {C, D}, then we denote by AGx S the subset of agents that play strategy x in S. Hence, for a social system Σ = M , η , the normative system η AGC S only implements the restrictions for those agents that choose to cooperate in GΣ.
Note that this is the same as η AGD S : the normative system that excludes all the restrictions of agents that play D in GΣ.
Note that in our toy example , although η3 is individually rational for each agent ,
