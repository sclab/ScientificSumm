, γn where K is a Kripke structure, and for each agent i in K, γi is a goal hierarchy over K. 4.1 The Utility of Normative Systems We can now define the utility of a Kripke structure for an agent.
We make this precise in the function ui ( · ) : ui ( K ) = max { j : 0 ≤ j ≤ |γi | & K |= γi [ j ] } Note that using these definitions of goals and utility , it never makes sense to have a goal ϕ at index n if there is
