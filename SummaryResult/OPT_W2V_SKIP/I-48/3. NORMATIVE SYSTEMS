Thus K † (η C) is the Kripke structure that results if only the agents in C choose to comply with the normative system.
Formally , let K = S , S0 , R , A , α , V be a Kripke structure , let C ⊆ A be a set of agents over K , and let η be a normative system over K. Then : • η C denotes the normative system that is the same as η except that it only contains the arcs of η that correspond to the actions of agents in C. We
