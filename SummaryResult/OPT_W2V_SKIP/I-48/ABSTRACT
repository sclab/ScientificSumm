In the underlying model of normative systems, we use Kripke structures to represent the possible transitions of a  multiagent system.
Using this scheme, we define a model of ordinal utility, which in turn allows us to interpret our Kripke-based normative systems as games, in which agents must determine whether to comply with the normative  system or not.
We develop a model of normative systems in which agents are  assumed to have multiple goals of increasing priority, and  investigate the computational complexity and game theoretic properties of this model.
We then characterise the computational complexity of a number of decision problems
