While the correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a  strategy that, if the following players play optimally, performs almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this definition becomes problematic when we consider that the other players may also be playing only approximately  optimally.
For the cases where computing an optimal strategy to commit to is NP-hard, we can also study the computation of approximately optimal strategies to commit to.
One may also study models in which multiple (but not all) players commit at the same time.
