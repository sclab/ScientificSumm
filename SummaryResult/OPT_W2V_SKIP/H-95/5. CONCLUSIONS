In queries where a geographical reference is not explicitly mentioned, we  propose to use the results for the query, exploiting geographic scopes previously assigned to these documents.
The proposed techniques for handling geographic queries can have many applications in improving GIR systems or even general purpose search engines.
However, our initial experiments indicate that for many queries, the referenced places can be determined effectively.
In a general purpose search engine, and if a local query is detected, we can forward users to a GIR system, which should be better suited for properly handling the query.
