We are currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via simulation, and exploring the design space of key  components.
PRO allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to  maximize its performance.
In this paper, we presented a simple receiver-driven  framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called PRO.
We are also prototyping this framework to conduct real-world experiments on the Planet-Lab in a near future. 
Furthermore , PRO uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions
