We conclude that a practical solution for  peer-topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured,  multiparent peer-to-peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in-time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.
Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons : First , to cope with dynamics of
