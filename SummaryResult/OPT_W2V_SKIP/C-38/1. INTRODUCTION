Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).
The main design philosophy in PRO is that each peer should be allowed to independently and selfishly  determine the best way to connect to the overlay in order to maximize its own delivered quality.
Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet , any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental
