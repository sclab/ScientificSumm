They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.
In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per JÃ¸sang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).
Moreover , they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution , methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have
