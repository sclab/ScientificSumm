Our starting point was an agent  estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet  distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent.
We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate  reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems.
In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated
