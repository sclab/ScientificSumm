Evaluation is an important aspect of information retrieval research, but it is only a semi-solved problem: for most retrieval tasks, it is impossible to judge the relevance of every document; there are simply too many of them.
This method creates large sets of judgments that are reusable for training or evaluating new systems that did not contribute to the pool [21].
Even if confidence is not high, as long as we can trust it, we can identify which systems need more  judgments in order to increase confidence.
Specifically , the question of reusability is not how accurately we can evaluate
