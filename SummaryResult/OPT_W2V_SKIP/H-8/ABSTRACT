While these judgments are very  useful for a one-time evaluation, it is not clear that they can be trusted when re-used to evaluate new systems.
Low-cost methods for acquiring relevance judgments can be a boon to researchers who need to evaluate new retrieval tasks or topics but do not have the resources to make  thousands of judgments.
In this work, we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments.
Using this method practically guarantees reusability : with as few
