Specifically, we want to learn a calibration function qij = Cj(q∗ ij) that will ensure that the predicted probabilities are tuned to the expert"s ability to retrieve relevant documents given the judgments that have been made to this point.
Since q∗ ij is based on the rank at which a document is retrieved rather than the identity of the document itself, the probabilities are identical from expert to expert, e.g.
Using these as prior parameters ensures that the resulting probabilities will be concentrated around the ratio of relevant documents that have been discovered for topic t. This means
