Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .
In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.
With such a conjugate prior , the predictive distribution of φ ( or equivalently , the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p ( w|φ ) = c ( w , T ) + µT
