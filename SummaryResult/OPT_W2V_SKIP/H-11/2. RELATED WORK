2.2 Optimal Experimental Design We consider a linear regression model y = wT x + (1) where y is the observation, x is the independent variable, w is the weight vector and is an unknown error with zero mean.
The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental design are: • D-optimal design: determinant of Hsse.
2.1 The Active Learning Problem The generic problem of active learning is the following.
In other words , the points zi ( i = 1 , · · · , k ) can improve the classifier the most
