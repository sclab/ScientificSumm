Thus, a new loss function which respects the geometrical structure of the data space can be defined as follows: J0(w) = k i=1 f(zi)−yi 2 + λ 2 m i,j=1 f(xi)−f(xj) 2 Sij (3) where yi is the measurement (or, label) of zi.
Requiring that the gradient of J(w) with respect to w vanish gives the optimal estimate ˆw: ˆw = H−1 Zy The following proposition states the bias and variance  properties of the estimator for the coefficient vector w. Proposition 3.1.
Note that , the loss function ( 3 ) is essentially the same
