For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.
It is important to note that the automatic relevance  feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].
To exhibit the advantages of using our algorithm, we need a reliable way of evaluating the retrieval performance and the comparisons with other algorithms.
Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set.
10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the label information is used by the system for
