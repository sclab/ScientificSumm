Thus, the optimization problem in RKHS can be written as follows: min Z Tr XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 X (13) Since the mapping function φ is generally unknown, there is no direct way to solve problem (13).
The ( n + 1 ) -th point zn+1 can be selected by solving the following optimization problem : max Zn+1= ( Zn , zn+1 ) Tr KXX KXZn+1 KZn+1X + λ1KXXLKXX + λ2KXX −1 KXX ( 15 ) The kernel matrices KXZn+1 and KZn+1X can be rewritten as follows : KXZn+1 = KXZn , KXzn+1 , KZn+1X = KZnX Kzn+1X Thus
