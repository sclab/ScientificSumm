Then CTM calculates the first and second moment of these maps as a representation of the natural color image pixel distribution.
Since robust and accurate image segmentation is difficult to achieve, the use of shape features for image retrieval has been limited to special applications where objects or regions are readily available.
We begin with a brief description of image representation using low level visual features.
Note that, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we do not use all the unlabeled images in the database but only those within top 500 returns of previous iteration. 
The classifier is then
