Their adaptive middleware uses utility functions to choose the best context provider (given the QoC requirements of  applications and the QoC of alternative means of context  acquisition).
In our approach, we let distributed context providers themselves decide who can provide  appropriate context information.
Henricksen and Indulska propose an approach to modelling and using  imperfect information in [3].
Our approach can reduce the burden of the middleware, because we do not need the  middleware to provide a context selection mechanism.
They also outline a  software infrastructure that supports the management and use of imperfect context information.
Most approaches to provide appropriate
