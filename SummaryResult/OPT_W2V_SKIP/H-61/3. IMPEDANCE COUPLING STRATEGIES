Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new  representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).
(3) is the general equation to compute the probability that a term ti is related to the  triggering page.
In our model , the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a
