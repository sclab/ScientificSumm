The selective-sharing mechanism presented in this paper does not make any assumptions about the format of the data used or about the structure of the distribution function of the parameter to be estimated.
Furthermore, most of the improvement is achieved in initial  interactions, which is of great importance for agents operating in fast-paced environments.
Selective-sharing allows an agent to benefit from other agents" observations in scenarios in which data sources of the same type are available.
Evidence for its general effectiveness is given in the general evaluation section, where environments were continuously randomly generated.
Furthermore , selective-sharing does not
