Based on this histogram, the CA can estimate the parameter either by  taking into account the entire range of values (e.g., to estimate the mean) or a portion of it (e.g., to find the expected cost when using a reservation-value-based strategy).
The number of additional  observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the  similarity between its owner and other owners.
The function in Equation 5 ensures that the number of additional observations to
