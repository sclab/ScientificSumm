The user associated with the above distribution function spends most of her time in  reporting (notice that this is the largest rectangle in terms of area), an activity associated with a relatively high cost of interruption.
At each step of a simulation , each of the CAs samples its owner ( i.e. , all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate ) and then estimates the parameter ( either the expected cost when using the sequential interruption technique described in Section 2 or the probability that the owner will have the required information ) using one of
