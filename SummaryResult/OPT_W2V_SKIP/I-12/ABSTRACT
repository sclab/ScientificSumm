This paper investigates the problem of estimating the value of  probabilistic parameters needed for decision making in environments in which an agent, operating within a multi-agent system, has no a priori information about the structure of the distribution of  parameter values.
To avoid undesirable bias in relatively heterogeneous environments while effectively using relevant data to improve its estimations, the mechanism weighs the contributions of other agents" observations based on a real-time estimation of the level of similarity between each of these agents and itself.
The paper describes a mechanism that enables the agent to significantly improve its estimation by
