Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agent"s bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.
However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should  actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.
In fact , if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent j '' s strategy so that its corresponding αj
