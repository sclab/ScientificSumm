We generalize our approach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough, which results in higher preference prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone.
We present a real-world study of modeling the behavior of web search users to predict web search result preferences.
We report results of a large-scale experimental evaluation that show substantial improvements over published implicit feedback interpretation methods.
Our key insight to improving robustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from the expected noisy user behavior.
Accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking , click spam detection , web
