[6] studied how several implicit measures related to the interests of the user.
Joachims [9] developed valuable insights into the collection of implicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.
By performing eye tracking studies and correlating predictions of their strategies with explicit ratings, the authors showed that it is possible to accurately interpret clickthrough events in a controlled, laboratory setting.
They built an instrumented browser to collect data and then developed Bayesian models to relate implicit measures and explicit relevance judgments for both individual queries and search sessions.
