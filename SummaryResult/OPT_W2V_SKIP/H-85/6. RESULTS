Furthermore, Browsing features alone have higher precision (with lower maximum recall achieved) than considering all of the features in our UserBehavior model.
Furthermore, by considering the comprehensive UserBehavior features that model user interactions after the search and beyond the initial click, we can achieve substantially higher precision and recall than considering clickthrough alone.
As expected, Recall of both strategies improves quickly with more days of interaction data examined.
Applying different machine learning methods for combining classifier predictions may increase performance of using all features for all recall values.
