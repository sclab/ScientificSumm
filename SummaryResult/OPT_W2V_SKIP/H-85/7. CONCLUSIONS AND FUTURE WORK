While our techniques perform well on average, our assumptions about clickthrough distributions (and learning the user behavior models) may not hold equally well for all queries.
A natural application of our preference prediction models is to improve web search ranking [1].
Our paper is the first, to our knowledge, to interpret  postsearch user behavior to estimate user preferences in a real web search setting.
Alternatively, our models could be used directly to detect anomalies in user behavior - either due to abuse or to operational problems with the search engine.
The predicted relevance preferences can be used for automatic relevance evaluation
