When this information arrives at a later time, Ri k will be computed and accumulated to future relative export errors (for example Ri+1 k if dak is received before DRi+2 is computed) and used in the computation of Î´k when a future DR vector is to be scheduled (for example DRi+2).
4.5 Steps of the Scheduling Algorithm For the purpose of the discussion below , as before let us denote the accumulated relative export error at a sender for receiver k up until DRi to be Ri k. Let us denote the scheduled delay at the sender before DRi is
