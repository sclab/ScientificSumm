Both the algorithms are based on delaying (or dropping) the sending of DR vectors to some players on a continuous basis to try and make the export error the same at all the players.
At an abstract level, the algorithm delays sending DR vectors to players whose accumulated error so far in the game is smaller than others; this would mean that the export error due to this DR vector at these players will be larger than that of the other players, thereby making them the same.
The drawback of this algorithm is that it tends to push the error
