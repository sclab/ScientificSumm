The receiving player computes the starting position for the entity based on xi, yi and the time difference  between when the DR vector is received and the time Ti at which it was computed.
Based on this model, Figure 1 illustrates the sending and  receiv1 Other type of DR vectors include quadratic DR vectors which specify the acceleration of the entity and cubic spline DR vectors that consider the starting position and velocity and the ending  position and velocity of the entity.
This trajectory is followed until a new DR vector is received which changes the position and/or velocity of
