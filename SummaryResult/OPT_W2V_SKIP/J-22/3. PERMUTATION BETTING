The auctioneer in a subset betting market faces a  nontrivial matching problem, that is to determine which orders to accept among all submitted orders i ∈ O.
Assuming qe = 1 for all e, this is a cycle C with a total of |C| edges such that the worst-case profit for the auctioneer is e∈C be − (|C| − 1) ≥ 0, since in the worst-case state the auctioneer needs to pay $,1 to every order in the cycle except one.
(1) Similarly we can define the existence of a match with  divisible orders.
Since order i is defined for a
