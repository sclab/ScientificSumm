Specifically, the paper demonstrates through extensive performance experiments: (a) How networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" so as to provide requested information effectively, increasing the benefit and the efficiency of the system.
The presented method enables agents to keep records of acquaintances" interests, to advertise their information provision abilities to those that have a high interest on them, and to maintain indices for routing queries to those agents that have the requested information provision abilities.
This paper presents a method for semantic query processing in large networks of agents that combines routing indices with information sharing methods.
