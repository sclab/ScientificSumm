As it is shown in Figure 4, as agents search and share information from run 1 to run 40, they manage to increase the benefit of the system, by drastically reducing the number of messages.
Experiments show: (a) An effective tuning of the networks as time passes and more queries are posed to the network, even if agents maintain the models of a small percentage of their acquaintances.
The comparison to the case where no routing indices are exploited reveals the same results as in the static case, to the cost of a large number of messages.
In such a
