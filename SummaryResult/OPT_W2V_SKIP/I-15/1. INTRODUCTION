This fact, has resulted to efforts that either require agents to have a global view of the system [15], to heuristics [4], to  precomputation of agents" information needs and information provision capabilities for proactive communication [17], to localized reasoning processes built on incoming information [12,13,14], and to mathematical frameworks for coordination whose optimal policies can be approximated [11] for small (sub-) networks of associated agents.
Specifically, this paper proposes a method for information searching and sharing in dynamic and large scale networks, which combines routing indices with token-based methods for information sharing in large-scale multi-agent systems.
