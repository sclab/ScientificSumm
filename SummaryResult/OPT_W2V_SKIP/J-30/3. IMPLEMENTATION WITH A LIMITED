For proving that the  informationtheoretically optimal result is achieved with threshold  strategies, it is sufficient to show that the social-choice function exhibits a single-crossing condition on expectation: given any allocation scheme, and fixing the behavior of the other players, the expected social value in any two actions (as a function of Î¸i) is single crossing.
The basic idea behind the proof of the following theorem is as follows: for every player, we show that the expected social welfare when he chooses any action (fixing the strategies of the other players) is a linear function of his type.
Therefore , an
