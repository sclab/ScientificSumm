Note that the definition above requires that g will be  single crossing with respect to every player i, given her  individual order i on the alternatives.
A player"s valuation function will be single-crossing if the effect of an increment in the player"s type on the player"s valuation for 2 We will show that, w.l.o.g., we can focus on deterministic allocation schemes.
Throughout this paper, we assume that the valuation functions of the players are single-crossing, as defined below.
We now define a singlecrossing property on the social-value function g. This property clearly ensures the
