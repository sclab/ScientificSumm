We can now apply  Theorem 2, and show that if the decision function f of the firm is multilinear (i.e., the decisions are made to maximize a set of multilinear functions), then the firm can design the education system such that the expected loss will be O( 1 k2 ), with a dominant-strategy equilibrium.
The standard assumptions about the cost  function are: ∂C ∂e > 0, ∂C ∂θ < 0, ∂C ∂e∂θ < 0, where the latter  requirement is exactly equivalent to the single-crossing  property (when C is differentiable in both variables).
Figure 2 illustrates the optimal mechanisms for k = 2 , and
