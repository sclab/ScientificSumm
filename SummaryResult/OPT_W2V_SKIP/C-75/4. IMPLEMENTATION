In addition to generating alerts in IDMEF format, Analyser_2 also directs the received data to the Analyser_3, in the level of complexity 2.
The generated data is directed to Analyser_1 and Aggreg_Corr_1 resources, in the case of Sensor_1, and to Aggreg_Corr_1 in the case of Sensor_2, according to the specification of their descriptors.
Classes were developed to simulate the processing of each Native IDS components associated to the resources.
A XML file describing each of the integrated resources is chosen by using the Connector component.
The Sensor_1 and Sensor_2 resources generate simulated data in the TCPDump [8] format.
