The functionalities of the registered resources in each of the scopes and complexity level can vary from one environment to another.
These resources then carry out the aggregation and correlation of the information from different domains and send it to the analysis resources in the first level of complexity in the third scope (level 3:1).
A given resource of DIDSoG interacts with other resources, by receiving data from the Source Resources, processing it, and sending the results to the Destination Resources, therefore forming a grid of intrusion detection resources.
The Descriptor is responsible for the information that identifies a resource
