However, the possibility of applying heterogeneous detection systems is left for future work Another DIDS for Grids is presented by Choon and Samsudim [2].
[6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including TCP, ICMP and UDP flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational Grids to IDSs.
[6] and [7] propose the use of Globus Toolkit for intrusion detection, especially for DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks; Globus is used due to the need to process great amounts of data to detect these kinds of attack.
However
