Based on the components of the architecture, several resources were modelled forming a grid of intrusion detection.
During the simulation, the different IDSs cooperated with one another in a distributed manner; however, in a coordinated way with an integrated view of the events, having, thus, the capability to detect distributed attacks.
In addition to the integration of IDSs enabled by a grid middleware, the cooperation of heterogeneous IDSs can be viewed as an economic problem.
DIDSoG presents new research opportunities that we would like to pursue , including : deployment of the model in a more realistic environment such as
