Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the  feature combinations.
In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.
Having compared different parameterizations of HITS , we will now fix the number of sampled back-links at 100
