[3] investigated various theoretical  properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al.
The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.
A more recent study by Borodin et al.
We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.
Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS , and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these
