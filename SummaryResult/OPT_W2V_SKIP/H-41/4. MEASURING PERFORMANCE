NDCG values are  normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.
Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.
The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.
Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.
The discounted cumulative gain at a particular
