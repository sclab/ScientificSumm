Finally, we studied the relationship  between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected  features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.
This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the  effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based  ranking algorithms, when used in combination with a  state-ofthe-art text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.
The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text  retrieval algorithm.
We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as  effective as web-page in-degree.
The evaluation is based on two large
