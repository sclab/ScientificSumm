Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA.
This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the  effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text  retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).
A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance , and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links ( indegree , PageRank , or HITS authority scores
