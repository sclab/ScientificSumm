For instance, if the example continues with a negative sample (Full, Strong, Red), we can specialize the previous rule such as {(?-Full), ?, (?-Red)}.
In this process, at each time one attribute value of negative sample is applied to the hypothesis in the general set.
Then, we generate new hypotheses as the number of all possible attributes by using the removed hypothesis.
Accordingly, the consumer generates a request where the color feature is set to red and other features are set to arbitrary values, e.g.
During the interactions , each request of the consumer can be considered as a positive example
