At starting node related to the first concept, the similarity value is constant and equal to one.
Therefore, we estimate the similarity of each hypothesis inside the most specific set S and then take the average of the  similarities.
In order to evaluate the similarity of feature vector, we firstly estimate the similarity for feature one by one and take the average sum of these similarities.
If the concepts are equal to each other then, similarity will be one (lines 2-4).
We find the similarity by dividing the weighted sum of the similarities of all hypotheses in S with the
