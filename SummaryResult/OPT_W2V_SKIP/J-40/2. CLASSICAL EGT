Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the  population [17].
In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a 1 âˆ’ fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t, and call these organisms mutants.
First we must of course  generalize the definition of ESS to a network setting. 
The game is defined by a fitness function F. All pairs of members of the infinite population are equally likely to interact with one
