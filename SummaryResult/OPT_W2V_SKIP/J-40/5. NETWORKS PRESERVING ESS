The following theorem relaxes this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have n1+γ edges, for some constant γ > 0, in which case it shows there will alway be at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.
Finally by Lemma 5.1, we know there are at most o(n)  mutants of abnormal fitness.
We also assume that the h(n) vertices already labeled have been done so arbitrarily, but that the remaining g(n) − h(n) vertices neighboring i and j are  labeled mutants independently with probability .
Since the degree assumption is somewhat strong , we
