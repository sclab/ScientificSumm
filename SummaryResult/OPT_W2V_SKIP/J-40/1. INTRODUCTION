In this paper, we introduce and examine a natural  extension of classical evolutionary game theory (EGT) to a setting in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network.
More generally, as evolutionary game theory has become a plausible model not only for  biological interaction, but also economic and other kinds of  interaction in which certain dynamics are more imitative than optimizing (see [2, 16] and chapter 4 of [19]), the network constraints may come from similarly more general sources.
There are many obvious reasons why one would like to examine more general graphs ,
