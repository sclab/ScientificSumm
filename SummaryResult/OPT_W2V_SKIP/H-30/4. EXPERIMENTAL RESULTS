Although we only provided the concepts generated for a single query, we note that the same analysis and conclusions generalize across other data sets, with coherent, topically related concepts being consistently generated using LCE.
Here, we define robustness as the number queries whose effectiveness are improved/hurt (and by how much) as the result of  applying these methods.
However, since our model is based on a number of different features over various types of cliques, it is more general and robust than a bigram model.
Figure 2 provides an analysis of the robustness of relevance modeling and latent concept expansion for
