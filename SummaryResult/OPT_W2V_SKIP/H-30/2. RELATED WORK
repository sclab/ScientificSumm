The only difference  between the two approaches is that relevance models do not explicitly model the relevant or pseudo-relevant documents.
The other technique, relevance models, is more closely  related to our work.
One of the classic and most widely used approaches to query expansion is the Rocchio algorithm [21].
Rocchio"s  approach, which was developed within the vector space model, reweights the original query vector by moving the weights towards the set of relevant or pseudo-relevant documents and away from the non-relevant documents.
The concepts used in their work are more general than those used in LCA , and
