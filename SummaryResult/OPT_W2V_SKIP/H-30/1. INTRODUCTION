In this work, we show how the model can be extended and used for query  expansion using a technique that we call latent concept expansion (LCE).
Therefore, by performing query expansion using the MRF model, we are able to study the dynamics between term dependence and query expansion.
First, LCE provides a mechanism for combining term  dependence with query expansion.
Recently, a Markov random field (MRF) model for  information retrieval was proposed that goes beyond the  simplistic bag of words assumption that underlies BM25 and the (unigram) language modeling approach to information  retrieval [20, 22].
