In this paper we explored the utility of incorporating noisy implicit feedback obtained in a real web search setting to improve web search ranking.
Our experiments showed significant improvement over methods that do not consider implicit feedback.
As another research direction we are exploring methods for extending our predictions to the previously unseen queries (e.g., query clustering), which should further improve the web search experience of users.
Interestingly, implicit feedback is particularly valuable for queries with poor original ranking of results (e.g., MAP lower than 0.1).
The gains are particularly dramatic for the top K=1 result in the final ranking
