Closely related to our work, Joachims [11] collected implicit measures in place of explicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.
Other studies of user behavior in web search include Pharo and JÃ¤rvelin [19], but were not directly applied to improve ranking.
Ranking search results is a fundamental problem in information retrieval.
This research, while developing valuable insights into implicit relevance measures, was not applied to improve the ranking of web search results in realistic settings.
We build on existing research to develop robust user behavior interpretation techniques for the real web search setting
