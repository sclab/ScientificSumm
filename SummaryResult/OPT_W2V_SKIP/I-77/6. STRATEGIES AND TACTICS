It is reasonable to  expect β to progress towards her target at the same rate and Nα(Ψt ) is calculated by replacing β by α in Equation 6.
If the set of options is empty then α will quit the negotiation.
A cautious tactic could use the balance to bound the  response μ to each utterance μ from β by the constraint: Vα(μ ) Vβ(μ) ≈ St αβ ⊗ (Nα(Ψt ) Nβ(Ψt )), where ⊗ is element-by-element matrix multiplication, and St αβ is the stance.
Following from Equation 5 , α will want to achieve a negotiation target ,
