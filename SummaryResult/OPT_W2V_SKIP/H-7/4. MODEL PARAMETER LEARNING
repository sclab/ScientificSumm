To estimate ¯wm, we only need to calculate the  numerical solutions for dimensions that are related to user m. To estimate σ2 k and µk, we only sum over users that are related to the kth feature.
Thus the corresponding weight of the director in the prior µk at the first M step would be very low , and the variance σm,k will be large (Equations 8 and 7).
Second , the parameters estimated at the modified M step ( Equations 12 - 13 ) are more accurate than the standard M step described in Section 4.1 because the exact
