Although we are focusing on the Bayesian  hierarchical linear models for recommendation and filtering, the new idea of using analytical solution instead of numerical solution for unrelated user-feature pairs at the M step could be adapted to many other problems. 
The research has much potential to benefit people using EM algorithm on many other IR problems as well as  machine learning problems.
The proposed technique can also be adapted to improve the learning in such a  scenario.
It is worth mentioning that even if the original problem space is not sparse , sparseness can be created artificially when a recommendation
