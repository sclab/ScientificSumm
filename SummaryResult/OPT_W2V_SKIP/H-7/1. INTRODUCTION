In order to learn a Bayesian hierarchical model, the  system usually tries to find the most likely model parameters for the given data.
One major challenge of building a recommendation or  personalization system is that the profile learned for a particular user is usually of low quality when the amount of data from that particular user is small.
The proposed technique is not only well supported by theory, but also by experimental results.
Learning the user profiles is the core problem for these systems.
Section 4 describes how to learn the model parameters using the standard EM algorithm , along
