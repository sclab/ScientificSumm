Providing personalized recommendations to users has been identified as a very important problem in the IR community since the 1970"s. The approaches that have been used to solve this problem can be roughly classified into two major categories: content based filtering versus collaborative  filtering.
Similar to some other researchers[18][1][21], we found that a recommendation system will be more effective when both techniques are combined.
We think each complements the other, and that content-based filtering is extremely  useful for handling new documents/items with little or no user feedback.
