A  system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model.
This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user  profiles.
Learning the model parameters to  optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive.
The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user data from Netflix and MovieLens.
