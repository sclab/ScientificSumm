A more interesting case is when the harvested energy is used as the primary source of energy for the system with the objective of achieving indefinitely long system lifetime.
Energy Generation Model: For wireless sensor nodes with limited storage and processing capabilities to be able to use the harvested energy data, models that represent the essential components of this information without using extensive storage are required.
More sophisticated methods which track the flow of energy into and out of the battery are also available.
It may be noted that for low power systems with more advanced capabilities such as dynamic
