In contrast to Case I, the duty cycles of future time slots with highest utility coefficient W(i) should be increased first in order to maximize the total system utility.
On the other hand, if the energy received is less than Pc, we will need to account for the extra energy used from the battery by the load, which is a function of duty cycle used in time slot i and battery efficiency factor Î·.
The remaining energy , RLast , is used to increase the duty cycle to some value between Dmin and Dmax in the slot with the
