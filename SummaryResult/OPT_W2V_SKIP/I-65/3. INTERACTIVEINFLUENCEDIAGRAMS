Given the distributions over the actions within the different chance nodes (one for each model of the other agent), the level 1 I-ID is transformed as shown in Fig.
As we  mentioned previously, the values of the node Mod[Mj] denote the  different models of the other agent, and its distribution is the agent i"s belief over the models of j conditioned on the physical state.
The decision node of each level l âˆ’ 1 I-ID is transformed into a chance node , as we mentioned previously , so that the actions with the largest value in the
