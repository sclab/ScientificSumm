I-DIDs address this gap by allowing the representation of other agents" models as the values of a special model node.
Analogous to DIDs, I-DIDs may be used to compute the policy of an agent online as the agent acts and observes in a setting that is populated by other interacting agents. 
In the previous representation of the I-DID, the update of the agent"s belief over the models of others as the agents act and receive observations was denoted using a  special link called the model update link that connected the model nodes over time.
Furthermore , we
