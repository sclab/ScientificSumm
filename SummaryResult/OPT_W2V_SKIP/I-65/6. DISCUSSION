I-DIDs may be seen as concise graphical representations for  IPOMDPs providing a way to exploit problem structure and carry out online decision-making as the agent acts and observes given its prior beliefs.
work significantly by being more transparent, semantically clear, and capable of being solved using standard algorithms that target DIDs.
We showed how DIDs may be extended to I-DIDs that enable online sequential decision-making in uncertain multiagent settings.
I-DIDs extend NIDs to allow sequential decision-making over multiple time steps in the presence of other interacting agents.
Our graphical representation of I-DIDs improves on the previous Figure 12 : A
