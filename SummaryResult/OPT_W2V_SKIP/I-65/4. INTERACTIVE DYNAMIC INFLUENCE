We adopt a two-phase approach: Given an I-ID of level l (described previously in Section 3) with all lower level models also represented as I-IDs or IDs (if level 0), the first step is to expand the level l I-ID over T time steps adding the dependency links and the conditional probability tables for each node.
Expansion of the I-DID over more time steps requires the  repetition of the two steps of updating the set of models that form the 2 Note that Oj represents j"s observation at time t + 1.
Consequently , each of j '' s
