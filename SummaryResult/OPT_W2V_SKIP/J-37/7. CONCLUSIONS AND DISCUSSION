It is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller, so GameShrink has time and space complexity sublinear in 8 Bridge is also a game of imperfect information, and partition search does not find the equilibrium for that game either.
We proved that in games with ordered signals, any Nash  equilibrium in the smaller abstracted game maps directly to a Nash equilibrium in the original game.
That game tree size has required us to use the approximation version of GameShrink (as well as round-based abstraction) [16, 15].
Using GameShrink , we found a minimax
