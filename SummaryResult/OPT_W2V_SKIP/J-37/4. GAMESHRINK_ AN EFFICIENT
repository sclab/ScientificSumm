By evaluating this dynamic program from bottom to top, Algorithm 1 determines, in time polynomial in the size of the signal tree, whether or not any pair of equal depth nodes x and y are ordered game isomorphic.
Thus, O(|Θ|S+5 ) = O(n|Θ|5 ), which proves that we can  indeed compute the ordered game isomorphic relation in time polynomial in the number of nodes, n, of the signal tree.
The problem of computing the index in ( either ) one of the dimensions is exactly the problem of computing a bijection between all subsets of size r from a set of
