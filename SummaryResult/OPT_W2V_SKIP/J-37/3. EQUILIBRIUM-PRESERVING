Associated with every ordered game Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u and information filter F is a  filtered signal tree, a directed tree in which each node  corresponds to some revealed (filtered) signals and edges  correspond to revealing specific (filtered) signals.
Each of i"s information sets in some round j corresponds to filtered signals Fj  ˜α∗j , ˜β∗j i  , history in the first j − 1 rounds (z1, .
Thus, we can uniquely specify this information set using the information  Fj  ˜α∗j , ˜β∗j i  , ˜z  .
For an extensive form game , a belief system μ assigns
