Also, for any feasible solution to the LP, we can get bounds on the quality of the strategies by examining the primal and dual solutions.
For a two-player game, we can always evaluate the worst-case performance of a strategy, thus providing some objective evaluation of the strength of the strategy.
Thus, the primal and dual simplex  methods serve as anytime algorithms (for a given abstraction) for players 2 and 1, respectively.
(A  variation of this technique may also be applied in n-person games where only one player"s strategies are held fixed.)
At any point in time , they
