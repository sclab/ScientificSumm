In contrast, BuddyCache uses application level multicast and a sender-reliable  coherence protocol to provide similar access latency  improvements for transactional objects.
Multiprocessor systems and distributed shared memory systems [14, 4, 17, 18, 5] use fine-grain coherence techniques to avoid the performance penalty of false sharing but do not address issues of availability when nodes fail.
Anderson, Eastham and Vahdat in WebFS [29] present a global file system coherence protocol that allows clients to choose 27 on per file basis between receiving updates or invalidations.
BuddyCache provides similar bandwidth improvements when objects are available in the group cache. 
These techniques use
