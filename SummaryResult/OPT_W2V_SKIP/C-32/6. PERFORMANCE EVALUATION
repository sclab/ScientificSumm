Our experiments run in a single server system and therefore, the commit time overhead of version cache management at the client does not contribute in the results presented in the section below.
In the three client group, Buddy and Base incur almost the same commit cost and therefore the entire performance benefit of Buddy is due to peer fetch avoiding direct fetches.
The number of misses avoided by peer fetch depends on k, the number of clients in the BuddyCache, and on the client co-interest in the shared data.
The overall time in the Reader group improves by 30 %
