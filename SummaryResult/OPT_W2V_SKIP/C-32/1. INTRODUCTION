One challenge is how to provide efficient access to shared  finegrained objects in the collaborative group without imposing performance overhead on the entire caching system.
With BuddyCache, a group of close-by collaborating clients, connected to storage repository via a high-latency link, can avoid interactions with the server if needed objects, updates or coherency information are available in some client in the group.
For transactional storage systems , the high cost of wide-area network interactions to maintain data consistency is the main cost limiting the performance and therefore , in wide-area network environments , collaborative applications have been adapted to use
