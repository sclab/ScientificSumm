This paper described BuddyCache, a new transactional  cooperative caching [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] technique that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for  collaborative strong-consistency applications in high-latency  network environments.
The technique improves performance yet provides strong correctness and availability properties in the presence of node failures and slow clients.
The main contributions of the paper are : 1. extending cooperative caching techniques to support 37 fine-grain strong-consistency access in high-latency environments , 2. an implementation of the system prototype that yields strong performance gains over the base system , 3. analytical and measurement based performance evaluation
