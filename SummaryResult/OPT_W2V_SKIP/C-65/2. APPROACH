However, the sensorboards are also connected to COTS MICAz motes and they share their AoA and ToA measurements, as well as their own location and orientation, with each other using a multihop routing service [9].
If at least three acoustic channels detect the same event, its AoA is also computed.
The  wavefront has a conical shape, the angle of which depends on the Mach number, the speed of the bullet relative to the speed of sound.
Our system is based on four microphones connected to a sensorboard.
Also, this method does not estimate a trajectory.
The shockwave has a characteristic
