Our 3rd generation sensorboard is designed to be used with MICAz motes-in fact it has almost the same size as the mote itself (see Figure 1).
The FPGA configuration (2.5 V) and a separate 3.3 V power net are fed by low current LDOs, the latter one is used to provide independent power to the mote and to the Bluetooth radio.
Although rudimentary acoustic signal processing can be done on these microcontroller-based boards , they do not provide the required computational performance for shockwave detection and angle of arrival measurements , where multiple signals from different microphones need to be
