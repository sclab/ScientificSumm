As it is primarily the soldiers that the system protects, a natural extension is to mount the sensors on the soldiers themselves.
The truly unique  characteristic of the system is that it works in such reverberant environments as cluttered urban terrain and that it can  resolve multiple simultaneous shots at the same time.
Moreover, the system should be useful to even a single soldier.
PinPtr is characterized by high precision : 1m average 3D accuracy for shots originating within or near the sensor network and 1 degree bearing precision for both azimuth and elevation and 10 % accuracy in range
