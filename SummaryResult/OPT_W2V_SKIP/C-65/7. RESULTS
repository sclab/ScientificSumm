There are several disadvantages of the single sensor case compared to the  networked system: there is no redundancy to compensate for other errors and to perform outlier rejection, the  localization rate is markedly lower, and a single sensor alone is not able to estimate the caliber or classify the weapon.
Since all the sensors were in approximately a  horizontal plane and only a few shooter positions were out of the same plane and only by 2 m or so, the test was not sufficient to evaluate this aspect of the system.
Since the range should not affect trajectory estimation as
