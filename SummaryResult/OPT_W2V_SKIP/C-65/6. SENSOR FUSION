For each sensor, we considered the shockwave length estimation valid if at least three out of four microphones agreed on a value with at most 5 microsecond variance.
In this case, all sensors located on one side of the  trajectory measure almost the same shockwave AoA.
We applied an outlier filtering and averaging method to fuse  together the shockwave direction and time information and come up with a single trajectory.
It is shown below that these measurements are sufficient to compute the position of the shooter (P).
To avoid this error sensitivity problem , we consider shockwave measurement pairs only
