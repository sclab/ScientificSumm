The  primary tasks of the sensor board software are 1) acquiring data samples from the analog channels, 2) processing  acoustic data (detection), and 3) providing access to the results and run-time parameters through different interfaces.
This architecture enabled us to deploy the same set of sensors in a centralized scenario , where the ad-hoc mote network ( using the I2 C interface ) collected and forwarded the results to a base station or to build a decentralized system where the local PDAs execute the sensor fusion on the data obtained through the Bluetooth interface ( and optionally from other sensors
