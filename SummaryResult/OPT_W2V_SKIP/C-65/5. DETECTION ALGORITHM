Although the cores are running  independently and in parallel, a crude local fusion module integrates them by shutting down those cores which missed their events after a reasonable timeout and by generating a single  detection message towards the mote.
At this point, the mote can read and forward the detection times and features and is responsible to restart the cores afterwards.
The only feature calculated by the core is the length of the observed shockwave signal.
If too much garbage is discarded in the collection phases , the core resets itself to prevent the ( false ) detection of the
