The focus of that work is distributed coalition formation among agents, but in our approach, we do not need agents to form groups before allocating tasks.
Compared to these works, our approach is more general in the sense that we are able to model different types of connections or constraints among agents for  different problem domains in addition to supply chain formation.
Agents are then allowed to move and actively search for tasks, and the capability of agents to perform tasks is  homogeneous.
[14] discuss the possibilities of achieving efficient allocations in both cooperative and  noncooperative settings.
