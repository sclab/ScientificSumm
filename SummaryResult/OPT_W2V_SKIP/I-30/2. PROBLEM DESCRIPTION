, am} in a social network SN, a task allocation is a mapping φ : T × A × R → N. A valid task allocation in SN must satisfy the following constrains: • A task allocation must be correct.
Each task t ∈ T can only be allocated to agents that are (direct) neighbors of agent loc(t) in the social network SN.
Given a set of agents A connected by a social network SN = ( A , AE ) , and a finite set of tasks T , the social task allocation problem ( or STAP for short )
