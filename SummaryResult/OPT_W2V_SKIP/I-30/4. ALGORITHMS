If the maximum flow is equal to the sum of all  resources required by the subset of tasks, we know that a  feasible solution exists (see Algorithm 2).
If the maximum flow in each network is equal to the total required resources of that type, the current combination of tasks is feasible.
A bid consists of all the resources the agent is able to supply for this task.
Each manager a requests help for t from all its  neighbors (of a) by informing these neighbors of the  efficiency e(t) and the required resources for t. 3.
In that case
