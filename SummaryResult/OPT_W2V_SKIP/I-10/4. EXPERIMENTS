We think that these benefits, which can be important with an increasing number of agents, are due to the fact that each agent really  memorizes only part of the total number of examples, and this part is partly selected by other agents as counter examples, which cause a greater number of current hypothesis updates and therefore, a better exploration of the hypotheses space.
After 1450 examples have been presented both 1-MAS and 10-MAS have exactly learned the concept ( the respective accuracies are 0.9999 and 1 ) but the single agent expresses in average the result as a 11.0 terms
