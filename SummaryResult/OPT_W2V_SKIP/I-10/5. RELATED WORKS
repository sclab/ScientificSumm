In mutual online concept  learning [14] the agents converge to a unique hypothesis, but each agent produces examples from its own concept  representation, thus resulting in a kind of synchronization rather than in pure concept learning.
Since 96 [15], various work have been performed on  learning in MAS, but rather few on concept learning.
In [10] each agent observes all the examples but only perceive a part of their representation.
In [11] the MAS performs a form of ensemble learning in which the agents are lazy learners (no explicit representation is  maintained) and sell useless examples to other agents.
