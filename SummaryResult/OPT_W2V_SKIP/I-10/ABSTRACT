Surprisingly some difficult boolean formulas are  better learned, given the same learning set, by a Multi agent system than by a single agent.
We extend this notion of consistency (or soundness) to the whole MAS and  discuss how to obtain that, at any moment, a same consistent concept representation is present in each agent.
The resulting method SMILE (standing for Sound  Multiagent Incremental LEarning) is described and experimented here.
This article deals with the problem of collaborative  learning in a multi-agent system.
Here each agent can update incrementally its beliefs B ( the concept representation ) so that it is
