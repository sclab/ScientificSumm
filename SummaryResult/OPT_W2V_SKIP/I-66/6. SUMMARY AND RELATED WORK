This paper presents four algorithms SPIDER, SPIDER-ABS, PAX and VAX that provide a novel combination of features for  policy search in distributed POMDPs: (i) exploiting agent interaction structure given a network of agents (i.e.
This algorithm is based on the combination of a classical heuristic search algorithm, Aâˆ— and decentralized control theory.
The key differences between SPIDER and MAA* are : ( a ) Enhancements to SPIDER ( VAX and PAX ) provide for quality guaranteed approximations , while MAA* is a global optimal algorithm and hence involves significant computational complexity ; ( b ) Due to MAA* '' s
