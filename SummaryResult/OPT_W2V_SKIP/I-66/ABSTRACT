Given the significant  complexity of solving distributed POMDPs, particularly as we scale up the numbers of agents, one popular approach has focused on approximate solutions.
A second less popular approach focuses on global optimality, but typical results are available only for two agents, and also at considerable computational cost.
This paper overcomes the limitations of both these approaches by providing SPIDER, a novel combination of three key features for policy generation in  distributed POMDPs: (i) it exploits agent interaction structure given a network of agents (i.e.
allowing easier scale-up to larger number of agents ) ; ( ii ) it
