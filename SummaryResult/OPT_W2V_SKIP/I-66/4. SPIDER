The expected value for this joint policy is used to prune out the nodes in level 2 (the ones with upper bounds < 234) When creating policies for each non-leaf agent i, SPIDER  potentially performs two steps: 1.
To reiterate this in terms of the agents in DFS tree interaction structure, we assume full  observability for the agents in Tree(i) and for fixed policies of the agents in {Ancestors(i) ∪ i}, we compute the joint value ˆv[πi+ , πi− ] .
In the example of Figure 2 , if the heuristic value for the second joint policy ( or second search
