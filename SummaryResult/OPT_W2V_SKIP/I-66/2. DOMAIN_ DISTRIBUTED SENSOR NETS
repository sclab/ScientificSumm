We assume that there are two independent targets and that each target"s movement is uncertain and unaffected by the sensor agents.
Figure 1 shows a specific problem instance within this type consisting of three sensors.
Given the sensors" observational uncertainty, the targets" uncertain transitions and the distributed nature of the sensor nodes, these sensor nets provide a useful domains for applying distributed POMDP models.
Thus, sensors have to act in a coordinated fashion.
In Figure 1 , to track a target in Loc11 , sensor1 needs to scan ‘East '' and sensor2 needs to scan ‘West
