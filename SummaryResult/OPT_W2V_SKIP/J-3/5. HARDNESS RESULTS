The Weighted Keyword Bidding  problem is hard to approximate to within (1 − 1/e). 
With this additional generalization we can show hardness of approximation via a simple reduction from the Maximum Coverage problem, which is known to be (1−1/e)-hard [6] (proof omitted).
Formally, we have weights wq for all q ∈ Q and our goal is maximize the total weighted traffic given a budget.
By a reduction from vertex cover we can show the  following (proof omitted): Theorem 7.
Now suppose we introduce weights on the queries that indicate the relative value of a click from the various search
