To calculate the spend of this strategy consider two cases: if u = 0 then we are bidding h(v) with probability pv = α/v.
4.3 A (1 − 1 e )-approximation algorithm The key to the proof of Theorem 3 is to show that there is a distribution over single-bid strategies from Lemma 4 that obtains at least (1 − 1 e )CΩ clicks.
Interestingly , the equivalence between this polytope and the LP dual above shows that there is a mixture over values r ∈ [ 0 , C ] that achieves an α-approximation for any curve h. After a
