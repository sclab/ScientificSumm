But, the equation above shows that each piece has its  incremental cpc equal to the bid that achieves it; thus in the case of VCG the pieces are also sorted by bid.
Hence we can obtain any prefix of the pieces via a uniform bid on all the  keywords.
For the sake of the budget optimization problem we can define VCG by just redefining costq(b) (replacing Equation (2)): costq(b) = p−1 X j=i (α[j] − α[j + 1]) · b[j] where i = pos(b).
Observation 1 still holds , and we can construct a landscape as before
