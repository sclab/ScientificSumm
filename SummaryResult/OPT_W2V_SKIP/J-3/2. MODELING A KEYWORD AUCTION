However, because of the structure of the graph, if the advertiser sets bu to $1, then his effective bid is $1 on both x and y.
If an advertiser is bidding on one keyword, subject to a budget U, then the optimal strategy is to pick a convex combination of (at most) two bids which are at the endpoints of the line on the convex hull at the highest point for cost U.
Suppose we would like to solve the budget optimization problem for a single query landscape.5 As we increase our bid from zero , our cost increases and
