We used a Gaussian copula to create dependence between value and relevance.7 Given the marginal distributions for value and relevance together with this copula, we simulated the revenue effect of varying q for different levels of  Spearman correlation, with 12 slots and 13 bidders.
The results are shown in Figure 2.8 It is apparent from the figure that the optimal choice of q moves to the right as correlation decreases; this agrees with our intuition from Section 5.
Figure 2 also shows that in principle, the optimal q may be negative.
Imposing a bound of , say , 5 %
