(5) To summarize, the minimum possible revenue in symmetric equilibrium can be computed as follows, given the agents" relevance-value pairs (es, vs): first rank the agents in  decreasing order of wsvs, and then evaluate (5).
Let K(r) be the number of bidders with wsvs â‰¥ r, and assume it is at most K. We can impose a reserve score of r by introducing a bidder with value r and weight 1, and making him the first excluded bidder (who in symmetric equilibrium bids truthfully).
With a reserve score of r , it follows from inequality ( 3 )
