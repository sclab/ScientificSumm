We would expect efficiency to be maximized at q = 1, since in this case a bidder"s weight is exactly his relevance.
Proposition 2 confirms that efficiency is indeed maximized at q = 1.
Perform an exchange sort to obtain the ranking that arises with q + starting from the ranking that arises with q (for a description of exchange sort and its properties, see Knuth [6] pp.
After the swap , total relevance will have changed by the amount esxk−1 + etxk − etxk−1 − esxk = ( es − et ) ( xk−1 − xk ) > 0 As
