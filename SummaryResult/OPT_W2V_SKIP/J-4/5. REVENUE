Absent this  regularity condition, the optimization problem seems quite difficult because it is so general: we need to maximize expected  revenue over the space of all functions g. To simplify matters, we now restrict our attention to the family of weights ws = eq s for q ∈ (−∞, +∞).
However, unlike in the incomplete information setting, here we are constrained to ranking rules that correspond to a certain weighting scheme ws ≡ g(es).
There is no weighting scheme g such that the virtual score equals the score, for any density f. Proof.
