Our approach is unique in that it performs predictive stemming on a per query basis without relevance feedback from the Web, using the context of the variants in documents to preserve precision.
However, the effectiveness of  stemming for English query systems was previously reported to be rather limited.
These mixed results, mostly failures, led early IR researchers to deem stemming irrelevant in general for English [4], although recent research has shown stemming has greater benefits for retrieval in other languages [2].
They also proposed selective stemming based on query length and term importance, but no positive results were reported.
