An abductive program is a pair P, H where P is an EDP and H is a set of literals called abducibles.
A program P with variables is a shorthand of its ground instantiation Ground(P), the set of ground rules obtained from P by substituting variables in P by elements of its Herbrand universe in every possible way.
E and F are sets of ground literals such that E ⊆ H\P and F ⊆ H ∩ P. When ( P \ F ) ∪ E has an answer set S satisfying the above three conditions , S is called
