Given an observation G as a conjunction of literals and NAF-literals possibly containing variables, we introduce a new ground literal O together with the rule O ← G. In this case, O has an explanation (E, F) iff G has the same explanation.
If P ∪ { ← not G } has a consistent answer set S, G has the  minimal explanation (E, F) = (∅, ∅) and S satisfies G. Now we provide methods for computing (counter-)proposals.
If G is a ground literal and the program P ∪ { ← not G } has a  consistent answer set, put G in Sn.
