A(N, S) = 1, while work units are still left to allocate (4) In SS, the maximum imbalance is limited by the  processing time of a work unit in the slowest node.
Its goal is to create a tradeoff between the number of the work units processed and the imbalance in finishing times (equation 8).
A(N, S) = N S (3) 3.4 Self Scheduling (SS) Self Scheduling (SS) [15] distributes a single work unit to every slave node (equation 4).
3.2 Task Allocation Strategies Given a master/slave application composed by a master m and S slaves , the allocation function
