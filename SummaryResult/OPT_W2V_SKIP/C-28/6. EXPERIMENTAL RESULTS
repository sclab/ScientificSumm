Considering the worst (L04), average (P01) and best (NB) node in the grid, the speedups obtained were superlinear, close to linear and sublinear, respectively.
Three scenarios were simulated (table 5): 1) with PSS strategy, but without workload; 2) with PSS strategy and workload (PSS 2x), to use grid environment knowledge obtained in the preceeding iteration; and 3) Execution without PSS and with workload.
To evaluate PSS, we executed PackageBLAST with 16 grid nodes, introducing local workload in nodes L01, L02, P01 and P02.
Execution times for all allocation strategies are presented in table 3.
