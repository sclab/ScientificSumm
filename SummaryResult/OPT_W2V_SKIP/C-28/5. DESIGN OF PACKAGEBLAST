The slave processes τ database segments and notifies the master, which uses the last Ω notifications to compute the next allocation block size based on the  selected allocation strategy and the weight provided by PSS.
We also propose a strategy to compute grid nodes execution weight which distributes work units (database segments) to grid nodes according to their current computational power.
Distribute Work Units is the module responsible for the communication between the master and slaves nodes.
It distributes the work units generated by the previous module and collects the notifications.
At the moment of computation of Γ , if
