To compare two sequences, we must find the best  alignment, which is to place one sequence above the other making clear the correspondence between similar characters [7].
In the seeding step, a query  sequence is split in portions called words of size W. These words are matched to database sequences and used as  alignment seeds if their scores are higher than a threshold T. In the extension step, alignments are generated from seeds.
In this scenario, the use of exact methods such as SW is prohibitive.
Given an alignment between two sequences , a score is usually associated for it
