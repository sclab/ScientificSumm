One of their approaches, called the tail game, is related to the reverse rule of Chun [1].
A key axiom that we introduce gives us a bound on cost share of a job in a group of jobs which have the same ratio of unit time waiting cost and  processing time (these jobs can be ordered in any manner between themseleves in an efficient ordering).
