For adjusted  noenvy, if (σ, t) is an allocation for some q ∈ Q, let tij be the 237 transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with respect to ordering σij .
For example, if ψ is efficient, then tij cannot be calculated if σij is also not efficient.
An allocation rule satisfies no-envy if for all q ∈ Q , ( σ , t ) ∈ ψ ( q ) , and i , j ∈ N , we have πi ≤ ci ( σij ) − tj , where π is the cost share
