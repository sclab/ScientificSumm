An allocation for q = (N, p, θ) ∈ Q has two components: an ordering σ and a transfer ti for every job i ∈ N. ti denotes the payment received by job i.
σ : N → N is an ordering of jobs in N and σi denotes the position of job i in the ordering σ.
The costs to jobs in S \ {i, j} is not changed from σ∗ to σ.
Define a new ordering σ by interchanging i and j in σ∗ .
Sometimes , we will deal with only a subset of jobs S ⊆ N. The ordering σ
