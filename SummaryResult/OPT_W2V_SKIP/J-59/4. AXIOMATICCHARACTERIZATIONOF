This gives us the Shapley values of jobs i through n. Setting i = 1, we get cost shares of all the jobs from ψ as the Shapley value.
An implication of Pareto indifference axiom and Lemma 2 is that for every efficient ordering there is some set of transfers of jobs such that it is part of an efficient rule and the cost share of a job in all these allocations are same.
Consider any job i , in an efficient ordering σ , if we increase the value of γj for some j = i such that σj >
