By definition, true occurrences of a query are found automatically by searching the manual transcripts  using the following rule: the gap between adjacent words in a query must be less than 0.5 seconds in the corresponding speech.
We give a higher rank to occurrences of OOV terms that contain phones close (in time) to each other.
For OOV search, we check that the distance in time between two adjacent phones of a query term is less that 0.2 seconds; this value has been determined empirically.
For evaluating the results , each system output occurrence is judged as correct or not
