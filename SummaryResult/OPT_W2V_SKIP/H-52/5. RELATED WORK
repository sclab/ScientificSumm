[17] propose a model for spoken document retrieval using WCNs in order to improve the recall and the MAP of the search.
Consequently, phonetic approaches should be used only for OOV search; for  searching queries containing also IV terms, this technique affects the performance of the retrieval in comparison to the word based approach.
in [5, 4] propose to merge a word approach with a phonetic approach in the context of video retrieval.
An alternative approach consists of using word lattices in order to improve the effectiveness of SDR.
They propose three different retrieval strategies : search both the word
