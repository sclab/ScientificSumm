Typical structures of a lattice and a WCN are given in Figure 1.
One of the main advantages of WCN is that it also provides an alignment for all of the words in the lattice.
As stated in [18], although WCNs are more compact than word lattices, in general the 1-best path obtained from WCN has a better word accuracy than the 1-best path obtained from the corresponding word lattice.
As explained in [13], the three main steps for building a WCN from a word lattice are as follows: 1.
