We present a vocabulary independent system that can  handle arbitrary queries, exploiting the information provided by having both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts.
The transcripts are indexed for query  processing and ranking purpose.

In addition to the output word transcript, advanced systems provide also phonetic transcripts, against which query terms can be matched  phonetically.
