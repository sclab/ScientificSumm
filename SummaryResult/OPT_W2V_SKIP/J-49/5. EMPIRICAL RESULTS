The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction  accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts.
Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and  LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance  measures across all 210 games.
When there are more than 500 experts, increasing number of  experts used in LogOP improves the prediction accuracy  measured by absolute error, but worsens the accuracy measured by the other two metrics.
To test whether this difference is statistically significant , we shuï¬„e predictions from two methods , randomly
