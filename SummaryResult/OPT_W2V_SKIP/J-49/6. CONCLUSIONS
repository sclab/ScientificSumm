We have selected four opinion pools to represent the prediction accuracy level that LinOP and LogOP can achieve.
In screening for representative opinion pools to compare with information markets, we investigate the effect of weights and number of experts on prediction accuracy.
In the future, we are interested in further  exploring: â€¢ Performance comparison of information markets with other opinion pools and mathematical aggregation  procedures.
In this paper , we compare prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and logarithmic opinion pools ( LinOP and LogOP ) using predictions from two markets and 1966 individuals regarding the outcomes of 210
