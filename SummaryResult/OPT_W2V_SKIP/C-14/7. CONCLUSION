We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to  deployment and sensors.
The minimum exposure is used as a measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the  region.
These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment for varying number of sensors deployed in each step.
The  solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by  considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step and this multiple variables problem requires further  investigation. 
The cost function
