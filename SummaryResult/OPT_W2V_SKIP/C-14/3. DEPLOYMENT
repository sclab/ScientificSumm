Deploying the M sensors results in the  maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.
The number of sensors used in this strategy can be  minimized by deploying one sensor at a time.
However, a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and  deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the cost of single sensors.
The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and
