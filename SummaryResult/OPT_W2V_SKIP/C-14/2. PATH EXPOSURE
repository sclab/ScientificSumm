(2) As above, if the noise processes at the sensors are  independent and AWGN, then the false alarm probability can be computed from the Chi-square distribution of degree n. 2.1.2 Decision Fusion.
Since detection  attempts by the sensor network occur at a fixed frequency, we can associate each detection attempt with a point u ∈ P when assuming that the target traverses the field at a  constant speed.
A target traversing the sensor field using path P is detected if it is detected at some point u ∈ P. The exposure of path P is the net probability of detecting
