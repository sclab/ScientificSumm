For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure.
We use the cumulative distribution function obtained from the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the  desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of sensors.
When  randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a placement providing a desirable minimum exposure.
The region monitored is of size 20Ã—20 with a noise ( AWGN ) of variance 1 , so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when the
