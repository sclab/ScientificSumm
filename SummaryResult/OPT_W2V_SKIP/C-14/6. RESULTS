Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.
The optimal number of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can be derived from these results.
We further assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ S. In this case , Equation 4 reduces to E { C } = ( Cd + n.Cs ) S−1 i=1 i. i−1
