The deployment can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be  airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means,  generally resulting in a random placement.
The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target  detection in a region of interest.
This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor networks performing target detection over a region of  interest.
The deployment of sensor networks varies with the application considered.
In this study , the deployment is assumed to be random which
