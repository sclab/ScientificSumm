, yid be points on the facets of Λi that intersect yi, such that ||pjr||1 · ||yi − yis||∞ = o(1) for all j, s and r. We call the set of points yi, yi1, .
Let C be a set of demand functions from Rd + to Rd + then fatC(γ) = ∞ Proof 1: For ε > 0 let pi = 2−i p for i = 1, .
, ( ynd , pnd ) is consistent with monotone concave utility function maximization and again by Afriat '' s theorem there exists u supporting a demand function fb ✷ The proof above relies on the fact that
