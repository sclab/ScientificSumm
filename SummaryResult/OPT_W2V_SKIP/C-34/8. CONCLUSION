The new algorithm uses the good characteristics of node codes and high fault-tolerance of H(k,u,m,v,n) model to route and predistribute pairwise keys, in which nodes are not needed to be able to communicate with each other directly such as that the algorithms proposed by [7] shall need.
So, the traditional pairwise key predistribution algorithm based on hypercube model [7] is only a special case of the new algorithm proposed in this paper.
And Based on the H ( k , u , m , v , n ) model , an innovative pairwise key predistribution
