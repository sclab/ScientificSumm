Theorem 4: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor network, then when u â‰¥ v2 , the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes, when using the key distribution scheme based on the hypercube model H(v,p), is smaller than that when using the key distribution scheme based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model.
7.1 Practical Analyses According to the former description and analyses , it is easy to know that the above newly proposed algorithm has the following properties : Property 3 : When there exist no fault and compromised
