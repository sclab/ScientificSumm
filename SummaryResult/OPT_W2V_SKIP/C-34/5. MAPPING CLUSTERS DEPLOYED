So according to the theorem 1, we can know that nodes A, I1,…,It-1, B form a correct key path between node A and B.
In addition, in those nodes, the distance between any two neighboring nodes is 1, so from theorem 1, it is easy to know that there exists direct pairwise key between any two neighboring nodes among those nodes.
Since d=t , according to the construction properties of H ( k , u , m , v , n ) , it is easy to know that there exist t-1 intermediate nodes I1 , … ,
