The optimal representative for a sequence of postings depends only on their minimal and maximal  payload (pmin and pmax) and can be looked up using optrep in O(1) (see [16] for details).
Second, when coalescing a subsequence of postings of the  input into a single posting of the output, we want the  approximation error to be below a threshold .
[6], where the simpler problem of coalescing only equal information was considered.
This idea is illustrated in Figure 1, which plots non-coalesced and coalesced scores of postings belonging to a single document.
As an input we are given a sequence
