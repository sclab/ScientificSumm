We also measured wall-clock times on a sample of the queries with results indicating improvements in execution time by up to a factor of 12. 
ii) For the PG method we see that for an acceptable performance degradation of only 10% (i.e., Î³ = 1.10) the required space drops by more than one order of magnitude in comparison to Popt on both datasets.
Note that EPC values are smaller on WIKI than on  UKGOV, since terms in the query workload employed for WIKI are relatively rarer in the corpus.
Index size continues to reduce on both datasets , as we increase
