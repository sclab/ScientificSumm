As mentioned earlier, we want to enrich a keyword query q with a timestamp t, so that q be evaluated over Dt , i.e., the state of the collection at time t. The enriched time-travel query is written as q t for brevity.
The second factor widf ( v , t ) , which we refer to as the idf-score in the remainder , conveys the inverse document frequency of term v in the collection at time t and is defined as widf ( v , t ) = log N ( t ) âˆ’ df ( v , t )
