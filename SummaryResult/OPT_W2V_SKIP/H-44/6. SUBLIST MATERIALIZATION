In detail, the technique, which we refer to as PG (Performance  Guarantee) in the remainder, finds a set M that has minimal required space, but guarantees for any elementary time  interval [ti, ti+1) (and thus for any query q t with t ∈ [ti, ti+1)) that performance is worse than optimal by at most a factor of γ ≥ 1.
The initial approach described above that keeps only the full list Lv and thus picks M = { [t1, tn) } is referred to as Sopt in the remainder.
As we argued above , we solely have to look at sets M that
