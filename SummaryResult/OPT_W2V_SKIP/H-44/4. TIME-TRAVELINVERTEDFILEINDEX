We transparently extend the  sequential reading, which is - to the best of our  knowledgecommon to all query processing techniques on inverted file indexes, thus making them suitable for time-travel  queryprocessing.
We note that our proposed extension of the inverted file index makes no assumptions about the sort-order of  index lists.
4.3 Query Processing During processing of a time-travel query q t , for each query term the corresponding idf-score valid at time t is retrieved from the extended vocabulary.
The main idea for inverted lists is that we include a validity timeinterval [ tb , te ) in postings to denote
