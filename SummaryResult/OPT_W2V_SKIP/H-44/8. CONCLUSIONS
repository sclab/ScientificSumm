In this work we have developed an efficient solution for time-travel text search over temporally versioned document collections.
: How can we even further improve performance by applying (and possibly extending) encoding, compression, and skipping techniques [35]?.
How can the described time-travel text search functionality enable or speed up text mining along the time axis (e.g., tracking sentiment changes in customer opinions)? 
Experiments on two real-world datasets showed that a combination of the proposed techniques can reduce index size by up to an order of magnitude while achieving nearly optimal performance and highly accurate results.
The present work opens up many
