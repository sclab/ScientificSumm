Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.
For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.
Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping
