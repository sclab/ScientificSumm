This does, however, turn out to be the case: given any mechanism, we can construct a nonmanipulable  mechanism whose performance is identical, as follows.
After all, it is not immediately  obvious that there are no manipulable mechanisms that, even when agents report their types strategically and hence  sometimes untruthfully, still reach better outcomes (according to whatever objective we use) than any nonmanipulable  mechanism.
However, because here we focus on flatly represented outcome and type spaces, this is not a concern here.)
The agents report their preferences ( or types ) to the interface layer ; subsequently , the interface layer
