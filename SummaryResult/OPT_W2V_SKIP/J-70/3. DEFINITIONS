In any automated mechanism design  setting with an IR constraint, there is a fallback outcome o0 ∈ O where, for any agent i and any type θi ∈ Θi, we have ui(θi, o0) = 0.
, θN ) gives the payment made by agent i when the reported types are θ1, .
We consider the following kinds of  mechanism: • A deterministic mechanism without payments consists of an outcome selection function o : Θ1 × Θ2 × .
In an automated mechanism design setting , we are given : • a finite set of outcomes O ; • a finite set of N agents ;
