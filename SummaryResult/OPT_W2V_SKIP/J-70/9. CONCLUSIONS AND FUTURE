Future research includes studying automated mechanism design with a self-interested designer in more restricted  settings such as auctions (where the designer"s objective may include preferences about which bidder should receive the good-as well as payments).
In this setting, we showed that designing an optimal  deterministic mechanism is NP-complete in two important  special cases: when the center is interested only in the payments made to it, and when payments are not possible and the  center is interested only in the outcome chosen.
We then showed that allowing randomization in the mechanism makes the design problem in all these settings
