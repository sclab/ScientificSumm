Then, if the optimal auction solution allocates item so to the bidder for a type, in the AMD solution, let the mechanism choose outcome o for that type.
By the at-most-one-item observation, we can  without loss of generality restrict ourselves to allocations where each bidder receives at most one item.
It follows that there exists a solution to the optimal auction design instance.
To show NP-hardness , we reduce an arbitrary paymentmaximizing deterministic AMD instance , with a single agent and a uniform distribution over types , to the following optimal combinatorial auction design problem instance with a single bidder
