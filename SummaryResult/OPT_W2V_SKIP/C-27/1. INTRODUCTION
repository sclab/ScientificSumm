While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.
These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.
Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.
Other solutions require per node devices that can perform
