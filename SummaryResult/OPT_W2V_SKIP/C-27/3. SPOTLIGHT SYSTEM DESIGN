At t = 4 the section where each node resides can be determined A more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the plane, hence the number of bits in the code will increase.
Point, Line and Area Cover events) every second and that the maximum tolerable localization error is r. Table 1 presents the execution cost comparison of the three different Spotlight techniques.
Returning to the example shown in Figure 5 , if a sensor node is located in the section with code 0000 , and due to the noise , at time t = 3 , it thinks it
