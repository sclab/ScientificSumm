Figure 10. μSpotlight system implementation With this implementation of the Spotlight system, we were able to generate Point, Line and Area Scan events.
This allowed us to bypass the windowing system and more precisely estimate the time when an event is displayed by the projector, hence a higher accuracy of timestamps of events.
After the Spotlight device receives the ACK, at its local time T4, the time synchronization can be achieved as follows: 2 )()( 4312 TTTT Offset −+− = (11) OffsetTTT spotlightnodeglobal +== We note that Equation 11 assumes that the one trip delays are the same in both directions.
