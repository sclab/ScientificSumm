Figures 26 and 27 show the localization error versus the event size at two different ranges: 46m and 170m.
Event Size for the Point Scan EDF The obtained localization error varied from as little as 2cm to over 11cm for the largest event.
It can be observed, that while the scanning speed, varying between 35cm/sec and 87cm/sec has a minor influence on the localization accuracy, the size of the event has a dramatic effect.
Event Size for the Point Scan EDF 20 An interesting trade-off is between the localization accuracy ( usually the most important factor ) , and the
