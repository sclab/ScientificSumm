To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a sub-meter localization error, obtained in an outdoor environment, without equipping the wireless sensor nodes with specialized ranging hardware.
We evaluate the performance of our system in deployments of Mica2 and XSM motes.
We demonstrate that a high accuracy in localization can be achieved without the aid of expensive hardware on the sensor nodes, as required by other localization systems.
Through performance evaluations of a real system deployed outdoors, we obtain a 20cm localization error.
The problem of localization of wireless sensor nodes has long been regarded as
