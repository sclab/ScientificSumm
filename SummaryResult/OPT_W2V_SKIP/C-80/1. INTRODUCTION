This allows hash-based  techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.
Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.
First, previous work in this space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags of bits with no internal structure.
On benchmarks modeling  multitiered web applications, the throughput improvement was as high as tenfold for data-intensive workloads.
This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.
