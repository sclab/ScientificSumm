To the best of our knowledge, Ganesh is the first system that combines the use of hash-based techniques with caching of database results to improve throughput and response times for applications with dynamic content.
Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching  solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.
This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2 bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin  fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data.
Instead , the work advocates for
