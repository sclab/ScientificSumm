With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning  different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.
In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.
In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.
While one can partially  address these problems by dynamically varying the parameters of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, this can be computationally  expensive, especially in the presence of changing workloads.
Second , this benchmark
