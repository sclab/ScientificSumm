JXTA is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network.
In order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the Apocrita network.

A JXTA socket is similar to a standard Java socket, however a JXTA socket uses JXTA pipes in underlying network transport.
