The reason is that several events that are used to model different protocol interactions can be modeled by a single service interface.
Note that protocol composition is clearer in the  protocol frameworks that are based on services, rather than on events.
Finally, we present the problem of dynamic protocol replacement and the advantages of service interfaces in order to implement it.
An addition of special protocol modules (named connectors) for routing events is also not satisfactory, since it requires  additional work from the composer and introduces overhead.
In event-based frameworks , the solution is to add an intermediate module Repl-P1
