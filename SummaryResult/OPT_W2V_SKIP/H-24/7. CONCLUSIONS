Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.
Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 
In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the
