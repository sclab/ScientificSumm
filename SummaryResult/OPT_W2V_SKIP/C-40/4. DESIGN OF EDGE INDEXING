Query processing for the spectator S means to search the node structure whose cell region intersects with S. In Figure 3(a), E2 is indexed on the same cell, thus being delivered to the client S after the query evaluation.
After one cell evaluation, the indexed user entities are retrieved and the computed node structure is delivered for every client that is associated with a user.
We also define two data structures for storing and retrieving the tokens: a node and an edge.
Edge indexing , however , requires one AT and one DT per point entity and two token
