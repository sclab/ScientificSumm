The expected time of any single entity update for edge indexing with full update is: T edgefull per update = Èo∈O T edgefull per update (o) |O| = 2(m + 1)(Ta + Td) (5) The analysis of the expected time of any single entity update for edge indexing with incremental update becomes complicated  because the time cost depends both on the side length of the entity AOI and on the moving speed.
Figure 6 shows that full update of edge indexing when the maximum reachable distance is less than the side length of any moving entities takes constant time to update the
