In contrast to traditional spatial indexing methods that construct an index on the moving objects, it builds an index on the continuous range queries, assuming that the queries move infrequently while the objects move freely.
Q-Index [13, 11] is one of the earlier work that re-discovers the usefulness of grid-based space partitioning for emerging  moving object environments.
The basic idea of the Q+Rtree [14] is to separate indexing structures for  quasistationary objects and moving objects: fast-moving objects are  indexed in a Quadtree and quasi-stationary objects are stored in an Râˆ— -tree.
Many studies have reported that the R-tree and its
