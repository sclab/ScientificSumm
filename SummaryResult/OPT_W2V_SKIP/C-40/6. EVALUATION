The program performs intersection tests between all user and all object entities exhaustively and computes the P, R, and E-measure values (shown in Table 5).
Figure 10 reveals the performance  difference between the exhaustive solutions and the two-table methods, a difference of up to two orders of magnitude.
If a virtual space is partitioned into tiled cells and a user point belongs to one of the cells, the ACQ-OR searches the objects whose AOI 409 Table 5: P and R computations of different visibility  determination schemes.
A lower value of P implies that the query result set contains a large
