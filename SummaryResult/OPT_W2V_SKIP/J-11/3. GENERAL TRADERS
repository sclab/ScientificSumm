When setting up the optimization problem for a trader t above, we used pi to denote the maximum profit i can make without the offer of trader t. Note that this pi is exactly the same pi we use here, the profit of agent i.
By optimality of the trade and dual solution z, seller i must trade with some trader t, and that trader will have equality in (1) for the buyer j that he matches with i.
This is clearly true for all traders t that are not trading with i in the equilibrium.
A trader t can
