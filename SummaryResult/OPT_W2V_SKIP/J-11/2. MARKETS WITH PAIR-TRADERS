Note that a seller or buyer i connected to a single trader t cannot have profit at equilibrium, so possible equilibrium profits are in one-to-one correspondence with dual solutions for which pi = 0 whenever i is monopolized by one trader.
We claim that this set of bids and asks, together with the trade x, are an equilibrium.
To formulate a way of avoiding such crossing pairs, we say an equilibrium is cross-free if αt ≥ βt for all traders t. We now show there is always a cross-free equilibrium.
Thus there is an optimal solution in which pi =
