It is found empirically that, when γ = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link  manipulation.
DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.
When γ = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored.
Consequently , γ is an interesting
