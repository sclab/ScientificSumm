After these investigations, we find that in all the graphs we tested, DiffusionRank (when Î³ = 1) is most robust to  manipulation both in value difference and order difference.
Figure 5 (a) shows that the order difference values change when we add new nodes that point to the  manipulated node.
4 (a), we choose four trusted sets (L = 1), on which we test DiffusionRank and TrustRank, the results are denoted by DiffusionRanki and TrustRanki (i = 0, 1, 2, 3 denotes the four trusted set); in Fig.
For nodes that have zero out-degree ( dangling nodes ) , we employ the method
