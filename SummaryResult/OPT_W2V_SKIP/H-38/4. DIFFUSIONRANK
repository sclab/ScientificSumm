For such f(0) in a random graph, we can find the heat distribution at time 1 by using Eq.
Formally the DiffusionRank is described in  Algorithm 1, in which,the element Uij in the inverse transition matrix U is defined to be 1/Ij if there is a link from i to j, and 0 otherwise.
(6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat  distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.
When Î³ = 0 , the ranking
