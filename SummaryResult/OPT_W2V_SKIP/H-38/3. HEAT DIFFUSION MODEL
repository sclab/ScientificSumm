(1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].
3.2 Heat Flow On a Known Manifold If the underlying manifold is known , the heat flow throughout a geometric manifold with initial conditions can be described by the following second order differential equation : ∂f ( x , t ) ∂t − ∆f ( x , t ) = 0
