While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general  personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons.
The second part is to utilize the biased PageRank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part.
The Web is modelled by a directed graph G in the PageRank algorithms , and the rank or importance xi for page vi âˆˆ V is defined
