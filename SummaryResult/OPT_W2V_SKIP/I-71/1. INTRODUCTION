In this paper, however, we address the case in which agents are already endowed with a top-down engineered ontology (it can even be the same one), which they do not adapt or refine, but for which they want to find the semantic relationships with separate ontologies of other agents on the grounds of their communication within a specific situation.
This theory is  particularly useful for our endeavour because it models the flow of information occurring in distributed systems due to the particular situations -or tokens- that carry information.
This scenario is reminiscent to those in which a group of distributed
