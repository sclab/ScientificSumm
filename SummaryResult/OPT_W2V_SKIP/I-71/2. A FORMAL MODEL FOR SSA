It is easy to prove that for each n ∈ N, gn defined as the identity function on types and the inclusion function on tokens is a refinement infomorphism from C∗ to Cn .
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) C}i∈{1,2} and Th(Log(C)) contains the constraints among agents" types justified by the fact that agents have observed e. Now, if E turns to another state e and agents proceed as before, another channel C = {fi : Ai → C }i∈{1,2} gives account of the new situation considering also the previous information.
Th ( Log
