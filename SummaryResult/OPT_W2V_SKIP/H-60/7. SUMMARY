By applying an independence rather a disjointness  assumption for the document containment, we could  establish a link between the noise probability (term occurrence in a collection), information theory and Poisson.
The links between indepence-based noise as document frequency, probabilistic interpretation of idf , information theory and Poisson described in this paper may lead to variable  probabilistic idf and tf definitions and combinations as required in advanced and personalised information retrieval systems.
From the frequency-based and the Poisson-based probabilities of  being noisy, we derived the frequency-based and Poisson-based probabilities of being informative.
We discussed that the absence of those parameters is compensated
