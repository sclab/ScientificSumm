We introduce the event notation t is noisy and t occurs for making the difference between the noise probability P(t is noisy|c) in a collection and the occurrence probability P(t occurs|d) in a document more explicit, thereby keeping in mind that the noise  probability corresponds to the occurrence probability of a term in a collection.
We generalise this definition and introduce the constant λ where 0 ≤ λ ≤ N. The  containment of a document d depends on the collection c, this is reflected by the notation P(d|c) used for the containment 228 of a document.
