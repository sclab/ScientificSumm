The probability of being  informative defined in our paper can be viewed as the probability of the disjoint terms in the term space of [12].
We restrict in this paper to the discussion of Poisson,  however, our results show that indeed a smoother distribution than Poisson promises to be a good candidate for improving the estimation of probabilities in information retrieval.
[9] shows experimentally that most of the terms (words) in a collection are distributed according to a low dimension n-Poisson model.
This motivation matches the motivation of our paper : We investigate theoretically the assumptions of classical idf and
