The definition makes explicit that the classical notion of term frequency of a term in a document (also referred to as the within-document term frequency) actually corresponds to the location frequency of a term in a document.
We consider a document as a subset of T and a term as a subset of D. Let nT ( d ) : = | { t|d ∈ t } | be the number of terms that occur in the document d , and let nD ( t ) : = | { d|t ∈ d } | be the number of documents
