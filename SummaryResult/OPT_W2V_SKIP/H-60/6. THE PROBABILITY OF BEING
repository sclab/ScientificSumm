The setting λ = ln N is special in the sense that the frequency-based and the Poisson-based informativeness have the same denominator, namely ln N, and the Poisson sum converges to λ.
The Poisson probabilities approximate the independence probabilities for large n(t); the approximation is better for larger λ.
The plateau here is  approximately at 1/6, and it is important to realise that this plateau is not obtained with the multi-dimensional Poisson noise using π = 0.5.
= eλ − 1 For λ >> 1, we can alter the noise and informativeness  Poisson by starting the sum from 0, since eλ >> 1.
