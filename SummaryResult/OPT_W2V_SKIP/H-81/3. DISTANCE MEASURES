The major advantages of the quantisation model are: (1) it is application domain independent, (2) the implementation is straightforward, (3) the model is easy to use and finally, (4) the new parameter p allows to control the similarity measurement process in a new way (discriminance on property level).
Between these limits, a distance measure that uses the quantisation model is - depending on p - more or less discriminant for properties.
Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates , a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance
