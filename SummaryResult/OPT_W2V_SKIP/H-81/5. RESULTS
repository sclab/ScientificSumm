For each descriptor the best measure and the performance of the MPEG-7 recommendation are shown.
135 best distance measures per descriptor, Section 5.2 shows the best overall distance measures and Section 5.3 points out other interesting results (for example, distance measures that work particularly good on specific ground truth groups).
The reason why the Meehl index is better may be that this descriptors generates descriptions with elements that have very similar variance.
Remarkably for a predicate-based measure , Tversky 's Feature Contrast Model ( P1 ) is also in the group of very good measures ( even though it is
