Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.
In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 
a descriptor scheme), a rule has to be defined how to combine all distances to a global value for each object.
If multiple descriptors are used (e.g.
Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information : Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color ( based on Scalable Color ) , Shape 3D ( based on 3D mesh information ) , Motion
