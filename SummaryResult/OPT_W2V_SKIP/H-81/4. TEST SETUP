Especially, no collection from the MPEG-7 dataset was used in the evaluation because the evaluations should show, how well the descriptors and the recommended distance measures perform on "unknown" material.
The querying process was performed in the following steps: (1) random selection of a ground truth group, (2) random selection of a query object from this group, (3) distance comparison for all other objects in the dataset, (4) clustering of the resulting distance space based on the ground truth and finally, (5) evaluation.
To be usable with distance measures that do not integrate domain knowledge , the elements
