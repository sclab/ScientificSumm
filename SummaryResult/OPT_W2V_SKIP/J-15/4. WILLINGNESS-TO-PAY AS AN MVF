Eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the  utility (wtp) of one full outcome (the reference outcome θ0 ), and then obtaining the function over each maximal clique using monetary differences between its possible assignments (technique known as pricing out [17]), keeping the variables in the conditional set fixed.
An outcome in this space is represented for example by ( θ , p ) , where θ is an instantiation of A and p is a value of p. We further assume that preferences are quasi-linear in p , that is there exists a value function of the form v
