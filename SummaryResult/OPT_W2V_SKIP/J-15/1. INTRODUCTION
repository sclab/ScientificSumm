To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.
Constructing and  communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical  multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some  simplified form.
On the other hand, fully general models are intractable, and it is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some structure.
In order to account for traders '' preferences , the auction mechanism must extract evaluative information
