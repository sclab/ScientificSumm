We will abstractly denote by C(ai, aj, t) the communication property, in other words, the fact that agents ai and aj can communicate at time t (note that this relation is assumed to be symetric, but of course not transitive).
(That is, the number of observations to be made by the agents in the system is not infinite.)
Who an agent can communicate with will be defined dynamically (for instance, this can be a  consequence of the agents being close enough to get in touch).
As a consequence , only a new observation ( being it a new perception
