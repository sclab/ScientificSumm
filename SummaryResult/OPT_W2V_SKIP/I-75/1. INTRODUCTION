We put special attention at clearly emphasizing the conditions on the system dynamics and protocols/strategies that will be exploited in the rest of the paper.
Section 4 details one of 998 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the main results of the paper, namely the fact that under the aforementioned conditions, the constraints that we put on the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system towards global consistency, at the condition that no agent ever gets completely lost forever in the system, and that unlimited time is allowed for computation and argument  exchange.
Many of these works however make
