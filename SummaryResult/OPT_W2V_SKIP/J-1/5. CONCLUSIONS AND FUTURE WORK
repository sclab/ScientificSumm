Although we know that it is impossible to have IR, IC and BB in an efficient mechanism it would be interesting to have an upper bound on the approximation to welfare achievable in an IR, IC and BB mechanism.
The question of the quality of welfare approximation both in general and in class domains that are not procurement class domains is an important and interesting open  question.
The GTR procedure outputs a mechanism which depends on a set X âŠ‚ N. Another interesting question is what the quality of approximation is when X is chosen randomly from N before valuations
