The task is, given these retrievals, to predict the ranking of systems according to some performance measure.
Much previous work-particularly in the context of  TRECfocuses on predicting the performance of systems.
The task here is not to test the hypothesis system A is superior to system B but to test the hypothesis retrieval A is superior to retrieval B. Autocorrelation manifests itself in many classification tasks.
We present correlations between the classic Clarity measure (DV KL), the ranking robustness measure (P), and autocorrelation (ρ(y, ˜y)) each with mean average precision in terms of Kendall"s τ.
τ adjusted
