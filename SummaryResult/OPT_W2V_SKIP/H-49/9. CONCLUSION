Our  experiments also demonstrate the limits of the usefulness of our predictors when information from multiple runs is provided.
To our knowledge, this is the first large scale examination of zero-judgment, single-retrieval  performance prediction.
This performance, combined with a simple implementation, makes our predictors, in particular, very  attractive.
First, our results could affect retrieval algorithm design.
Second, when provided retrievals from other systems, our extended methods demonstrate  competitive performance with state of the art baselines.
We have demonstrated this improvement for many, diverse settings.
We believe that these two directions could be rewarding given the theoretical and experimental evidence in
