5.3 Evaluation Given a set of retrievals, potentially from a combination of queries and systems, we measure the correlation of the rank ordering of this set by the predictor and by the  performance metric.
In our tables, we will label results for Clarity using DV KL and the ranking robustness predictor using P. 5.2 Generalizability Experiments Our predictors do not require a particular baseline  retrieval system; the predictors can be computed for an  arbitrary retrieval, regardless of how scores were generated.
Since we are predicting the performance of retrievals which are not based on language modeling , we use a
