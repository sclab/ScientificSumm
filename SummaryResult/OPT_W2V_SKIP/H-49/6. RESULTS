When  examining the performance of linear combinations of predictors, we note that in every case, autocorrelation factors as a  necessary component of a strong predictor.
However, these improvements are slight compared to the performance of autocorrelation on these collections.
In the cases where ρ(y, yµ) performs well, incorporating autocorrelation rarely results in a significant improvement in performance.
Ranking robustness was presented as an  improvement to Clarity for web collections (represented in our  experiments by the terabyte04 and terabyte05 collections),  shifting the τ correlation from 0.139 to 0.150 for terabyte04 and 0.171 to 0.208 for terabyte05.
For every collection except
