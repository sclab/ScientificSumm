The information introduced by the query, though, is retrieval-independent so that, if two  retrievals return the same set of documents, the approximate Cox-Lewis statistic will be the same regardless of the  retrieval scores.
In this case, we might take a document a, compare its rank in the retrieval to its average rank in the m retrievals.
The similarity between the retrieval and the combined retrieval may be computed using some  correlation measure.
In previous work, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the  normalized scores of the retrieval and the normalized scores of the combined retrieval provides the similarity [1].
