In this paper, we aim to develop a new learning algorithm that can directly optimize any performance measure used in document retrieval.
[8] take a similar approach and perform the learning by using boosting,  referred to as RankBoost.
All the existing methods used for  document retrieval [2, 3, 8, 13, 16, 20] are designed to optimize loss functions loosely related to the IR performance measures, not loss functions directly based on the measures.
Ideally , the ranking function is created so that the accuracy of ranking in terms of one of the measures with respect to the training data is
