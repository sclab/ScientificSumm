The learning process turns out to be that of minimizing the loss function which represents the disagreement between the  permutation Ï€(qi, di, f) and the list of ranks yi, for all of the queries.
At each round, it increases the weights of those queries that are not ranked well by ft, the model created so far.
AdaRank takes a training set S = {(qi, di, yi)}m i=1 as input and takes the performance measure function E and the number of  iterations T as parameters.
For example , a weak ranker can be created by using a subset of queries
