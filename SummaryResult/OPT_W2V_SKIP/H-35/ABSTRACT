Ideally a learning  algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data.
We prove that the training process of AdaRank is exactly that of enhancing the  performance measure used.
Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by  minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures.
In this paper we address the issue of learning to rank for document retrieval.
In the task, a model is automatically created with some training data and then is utilized for ranking of documents.
For example , Ranking SVM and RankBoost
