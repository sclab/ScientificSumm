[19] also propose a method of directly maximizing rank-based metrics for ranking on the basis of manifold learning.
[3] employ Relative Entropy as a loss function and Gradient Descent as an algorithm to train a Neural Network model for ranking in document retrieval.
For other  approaches to learning to rank, refer to [2, 11, 31].
2.1 Information Retrieval The key problem for document retrieval is ranking, specifically, how to create the ranking model (function) that can sort documents based on their relevance to the given query.
In the pair-wise approach to ranking , the learning task is formalized as a
