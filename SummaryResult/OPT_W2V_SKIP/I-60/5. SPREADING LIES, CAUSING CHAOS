Similar to the results in our first set of experiments, described in Section 4.2, we can see that randomly selected self-interested agents who follow different randomly selected routes do not benefit from their malicious behavior (that is, their average journey length does not decrease).
In this set of experiments, all the self-interested agents spread lies about the same 13 main roads in the network.
The results also indicate that the regular gossip agents are more sensitive to malicious behavior than regular agentsthe average journey length for the gossip agents increases significantly ( e.g. , with 32 self-interested agents the average
