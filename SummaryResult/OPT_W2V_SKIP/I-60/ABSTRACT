As more and more cars are equipped with GPS and Wi-Fi transmitters, it becomes easier to design systems that will allow cars to interact autonomously with each other, e.g., regarding traffic on the roads.
Though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a  natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.
Using a simulation environment, which  models a real transportation network in a large city, we  demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents if no counter-measures are implemented.
Nonetheless , this new technology and agent applications may
