In each iteration the same agents are used with the same origin and destination points, whereas the data collected in earlier iterations is preserved in the future iterations (referred to as the history of the agent).
Thus, in our simulation, we focus only on simulations in which the percentage of gossip agents is 20%.
To gain statistical significance we ran each simulation with changes in the set of the gossip agents, and the set of the self-interested agents.
For example , if an average journey length of a certain agent in iteration 1 with no selfinterested agent was 50 ,
