In the next section we describe another scenario for the self-interested agents, in which they are not concerned with their own utility, but rather interested in maximizing the average journey length of other gossip agents. 
It is also interesting to note the large value attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration.
That is, even with just one self-interested car, we can see that both the gossip agents that follow the same route as the lies spread by the self-interested agents, and other  regular agents, increase their journey length by more than 14%.
In this simulation , we selected
