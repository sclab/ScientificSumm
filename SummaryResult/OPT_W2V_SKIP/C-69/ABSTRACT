We have developed pTHINC, a PDA  thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display.
Our results  compared to local PDA web browsers and other thin-client  approaches demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.
Although web applications are gaining popularity on  mobile wireless PDAs, web browsers on these systems can be quite slow and often lack adequate functionality to access many web sites.
