This is followed by the execution of CCR (in the case of an abort), the retraction of a(v ), and failure.
This rule and the fail rule together are used for failure handling: if the current program Pi from a plan clause for a task fails, rule fail is applied first, and then if possible, rule Select will choose another applicable alternative for the task if one exists.
We achieve this as part of the source transformation by explicitly keeping track of the context of execution as an extra parameter on the events and an extra variable within each plan
