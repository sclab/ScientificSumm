Notice that if all agents are using the same sample size, N, then the value xN resulting from solving Equation 10 by substituting k = N and xk = xN is a stable reservation value (i.e., none of the agents can benefit from changing just the value of xN ).
We start with the even case, using a similar methodology: Assume otherwise, i.e., xk+l < xk ∀l = 1, ..., j − 1 and xk+2i > xk.
An upper bound for the equilibrium number of partners to be considered over a search round is the solution of the equation : A ( N ) = c
