The values for vi that may occur in a Nash equilibrium are those for which all dependent vj values lie in (0, 1); the latter condition is easy to check by computing the image of the interval (0, 1) under respective fractional linear transforms. 
For the second search, note that if Vi plays a mixed strategy, then vi+1 and vi−1 satisfy an equation of the form vi+1 = (A0 + A1vi−1)/(B0 + B1vi−1).
Since all vertices in the cycle play mixed strategies, we have vi+3 = (A0 +A1vi+1)/(B0 +B1vi+1).
(Otherwise, there is no Nash equilibrium of the desired form.)
