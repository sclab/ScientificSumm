In the downward pass, the chosen values are w = .1, then, from the trimming, v = 0 and u = 1, which is not a Nash equilibrium since W prefers action 1.
0.1 0.9 1 0.5 1 v w Figure 3: A trimmed policy for V The point is that the payoff matrix of W can now be chosen to prevent the LKS algorithm from finding a Nash equilibrium.
The best response policy for V is not a breakpoint policy (because of how the curve from w = 0 to w = 1 doubles back).
The proof proceeds by ordering the children '' s
