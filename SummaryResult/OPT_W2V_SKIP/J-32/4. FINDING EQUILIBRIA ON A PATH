As v = 0, 1, V is, in fact, indifferent between playing 0 and 1, which is only possible if w = f(vj−1).
Similarly to the previous case, we can show that B(W, V )∩[0, 1]×(0, 1) consists of the rectangle {α}×[0, 1] and at most 2j + 2 rectangles of the form [0, 1]×IV , where each IV corresponds to a connected component of B(V, U)|U=−B0/B1 .
Since w = f ( u ) , V is indifferent between playing 0 and 1 ; in particular , it can play v. Therefore , if
