Given an edge (V, W ) of the tree G, and a mixed strategy w for W , let G(V,W ),W =w be the instance obtained from G by (1) deleting all nodes Z which are separated from V by W (i.e., all nodes Z such that the path from Z to V passes through W ), and (2) restricting the instance so that W is required to play mixed  strategy w. Definition 1.
Typically, W is the parent of V , and this is just referred to as the best response policy for V .
Each vertex has two actions , which
