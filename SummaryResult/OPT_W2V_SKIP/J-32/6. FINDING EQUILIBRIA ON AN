Since f is a continuous function, the number of segments in each Si is at least the number of segments in B(Vk, Vk−1)∩[.1, .9]×[0, 1], which is at least 3k−1 by induction hypothesis.
For any two-pass algorithm A for which there exists an index j, j ∈ [1, n/4], a segment S of B(Vj , Vj−1), and an interior point (x, y) of S such that BB(Vj, Vj−1) does not contain (x, y), we can choose payoff matrices of the vertices Vj, .
As in previous section , we can show that B ( W
