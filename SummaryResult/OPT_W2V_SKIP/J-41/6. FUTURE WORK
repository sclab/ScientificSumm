Because the incomplete information case is such a close generalization of the most basic single-item auction model, it would be interesting to see which standard results from single-item auction theory (e.g.
Placing bounds on the revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is also a relevant question.
results with risk-averse  bidders, an endogenous number of bidders, asymmetries, etc...) automatically generalize and which do not, to fully  understand the structural differences between single-item and slot auctions.
The complication here lies in the fact that budgets are often set for entire campaigns rather than single keywords.
Assuming that the optimal choice
