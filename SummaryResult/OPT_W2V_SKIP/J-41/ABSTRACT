We show that there typically exists a multitude of equilibria with second pricing, and we bound the divergence of (economic) value in such equilibria from the value obtained assuming all merchants bid truthfully.
With complete information, we find that no equilibrium exists with first pricing using either RBB or RBR.
In this paper we analyze the  incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of two slot  auction designs: rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), which correspond to stylized versions of the  mechanisms currently used by Yahoo!
We also consider first- and second-price payment rules together with each of these
