2.3 Problem formalization Theoretically, the problem of query selection can be formalized as follows: We assume that the crawler downloads pages from a Web site that has a set of pages S (the rectangle in Figure 5).
3 For most Web sites that assume AND for multi-keyword queries, single-term queries return the maximum number of results.
Every potential query qi that we may issue can be viewed as a subset of S, containing all the points (pages) that are returned when we issue qi to the site.
( 2 ) Here , we use Pnew ( qi ) to represent
