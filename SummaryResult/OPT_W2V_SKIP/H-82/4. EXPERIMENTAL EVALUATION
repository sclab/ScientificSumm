Since the number of documents that are discovered and downloaded from a textual database depends on the selection of the words that will be issued as queries5 to the search interface of each site, we compare the various selection policies that were described in section 3, namely the random, generic-frequency, and adaptive algorithms.
Aside from this experimental variance, the Amazon result indicates that if the collection and the words that a Hidden Web site contains are generic enough, then the generic-frequency approach may be a good candidate algorithm for effective crawling.
Although the independence estimator is a simple estimator ,
