We propose three ways to relax Online SVMs: â€¢ Reduce the size of the optimization problem by only optimizing over the last p examples.
However, as we saw in the previous section, the task of content-based spam detection is best achieved by SVMs with a high value of C. Setting C to a high value for this domain implies that minimizing  training loss is more important than maximizing the margin (see Figure 3).
Note that this is not equivalent to training a new SVM classifier from scratch on the p most recent examples , because each successive optimization problem is
