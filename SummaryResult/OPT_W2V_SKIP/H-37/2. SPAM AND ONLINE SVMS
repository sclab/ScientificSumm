Because  previous work (and our own initial testing) indicates that binary feature values give the best results for spam filtering [20, 9], we optimized our implementation of the Online SMO to exploit fast inner-products with binary vectors.
Later work has not always followed this lead: a (low) default setting of C was used on splog detection [17], and also on email spam [4].
