However, similar  performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam filtering.
The former have advocated the use of  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for content-based filtering, as this machine learning methodology gives state-of-the-art performance for text classification.
First, we show that online SVMs indeed give state-of-the-art classification performance on online spam filtering on large benchmark data sets.
Content-based filtering is one reliable method of  combating this threat in its various forms, but some academic researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam.
Additionally , practitioners cite the high cost of SVMs as reason to prefer faster
