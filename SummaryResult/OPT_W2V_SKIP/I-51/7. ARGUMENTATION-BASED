• If Ai cannot generate any counterargument or  counterexample, the token is sent to the next agent, a new round t + 1 starts, and the protocol moves to state 2.
The voting mechanism uses the joint confidence measure as the voting weights, as follows: S = arg max Sk∈S αi∈Ht|αi.S=Sk C(αi) Moreover, in order to avoid infinite iterations, if an agent sends twice the same argument or counterargument to the same agent, the message is not considered. 
• If βt i is a counterargument , then , Ai locally compares αt i with βt i by assessing their confidence
