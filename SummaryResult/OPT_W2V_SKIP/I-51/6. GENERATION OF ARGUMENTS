However, there is no guarantee that such counterarguments will always win, since, as we have stated in Section 5, agents in our framework use a  preference relation based on joint confidence.
In particular, Figure 3 shows how when an agent receives a new problem to solve (in this case, a new sponge to determine its order), the agent uses LID to generate an argument (consisting on a justified prediction) using the cases in the case base of the agent.
In this way , the justification provided by LID will always be subsumed by Î±.D , and thus the resulting counterargument
