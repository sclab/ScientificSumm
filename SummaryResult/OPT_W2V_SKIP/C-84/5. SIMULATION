We observe in Figure 5 that more replicas are placed with payments than without when α is between 0.7 and 1.3, the only range of significant undersupply in the power-law case.
Indeed the high PoA is due mostly to  misplacement problems when α is from 0.7 to 2.0, since there is little decrease in PoA when the number of replicas in social optimum changes from two to one.
5.1 Varying Placement Cost Figure 3 shows PoA, OPoA, and Ratio, as well as number of replicas placed, for the line topology as α varies.
As shown in the analysis , the
