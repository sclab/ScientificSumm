Another  observation we made was that the number of replicas in a Nash  equilibrium can be more than the number of replicas in the social  optimum even without payments.
For example, a graph with diameter slightly more than α may have a Nash equilibrium configuration with two replicas at the two ends.
In our analyses, we assume that all nodes have the same demand.
One extension is to consider multiple objects in the capacitated caching game, in which servers have capacity limits when placing objects.
However , if we aggregate n − 1 nodes into one node with demand n
