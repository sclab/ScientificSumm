dkj < α (5) The first condition guarantees that there is a server that places the replica within distance α of each server i.
In this analysis we use simply α in place of αij , since we deal with a single object and we assume placement cost is the same for all servers.
Network (c) shows a Nash equilibrium in the payment game, where two replicas, one for each cluster, are placed.
Throughout our discussion , we use C ( SW ) to represent the cost of worst case Nash equilibrium , C ( SO ) to represent the cost of
