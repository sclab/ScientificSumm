The top row shows how the solution time for the MILP scales as we  increase the number of agents |M|, the global time horizon bτ, and the number of resources |Ω|.
In particular, this section introduces a problem domain-the repairshop problem-used to empirically evaluate our algorithm"s  scalability in terms of the number of agents |M|, the number of shared resources |Ω|, and the varied lengths of global time bτ during which agents may enter and exit the system.
Figure 4 shows runtime and policy value for trials in which common input variables are scaled together.
