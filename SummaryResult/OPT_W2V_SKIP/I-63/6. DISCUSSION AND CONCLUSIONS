In fact, all the results of [7] about the properties of the auction and information privacy directly carry over to the scheduling domain discussed in this  paper, requiring only slight modifications to deal with  finitehorizon MDPs.
As such, this work takes a step in the direction of  designing an online mechanism for agents with combinatorial resource preferences induced by stochastic planning  problems.
In summary, we have presented an MILP formulation for the combinatorial resource-scheduling problem where agents" values for possible resource assignments are defined by  finitehorizon MDPs.
This is a consequence of our MDP-augmentation procedure from Section 4.1.
