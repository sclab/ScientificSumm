Notice that an agent is not allowed to stop and restart its MDP, so agent m1 is only able to continue executing in the interval τ ∈ [3, 4] if it has actions that do not require any resources (ϕm(a, ω) = 0).
An agent m that receives a set of resources that does not include resource ω cannot execute in its MDP policy any action a for which ϕm(a, ω) = 0.
Thus , at time τ = 4 , resources ω1 and ω3 are allocated to agent m2 , who then uses them to execute its MDP
