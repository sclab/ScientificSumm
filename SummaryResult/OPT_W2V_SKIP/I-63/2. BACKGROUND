2.2 Combinatorial Resource Scheduling A straightforward approach to resource scheduling for a set of agents M, whose values for the resources are induced by stochastic planning problems (in our case, finite-horizon MDPs) would be to have each agent enumerate all possible resource assignments over time and, for each one, compute its value by solving the corresponding MDP.
In this case, the number of Ïˆ values is exponential in each agent"s planning horizon Tm, resulting in a much larger program.
For the scheduling problem where the agents are able to dynamically reallocate resources , each agent must specify a
