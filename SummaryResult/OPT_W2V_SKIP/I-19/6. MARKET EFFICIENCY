Now, in order to measure the efficiency of the market and the impact of a global bidder, we run simulations for the markets with the different types of local bidders.
Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the presence of a global bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case the local bidders are static.
Note that a degree of inefficiency is inherent to a multiauction market with only local bidders [ 2 ] .9 For example , if there are two auctions selling one item each , and the two bidders with the highest valuations both bid locally
