We first consider a model where all other bidders are local and participate in a single auction.
Finally, we address the efficiency of the overall market, and show that information about the number of  local bidders is an important determinant for the way in which a global bidder affects efficiency.
In addition, by combining analytical and simulation results, we  demonstrate that similar results hold in the case of several global bidders, provided that the market consists of both global and local bidders.
These results hold both in the case where the number of local bidders is known and when this
