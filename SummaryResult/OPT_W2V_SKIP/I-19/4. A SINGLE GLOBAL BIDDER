Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidder"s decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.
Therefore , we can ignore the first part , and the second part yields : bi = v bj ∈B\ {
