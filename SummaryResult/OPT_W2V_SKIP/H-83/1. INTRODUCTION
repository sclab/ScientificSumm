In the context of a localized search engine, if the PageRanks are computed using only the local subgraph, then we would  expect the resulting PageRanks to reflect the perceived  popularity within the local community and not of the web as a whole.
By restricting themselves to smaller, more manageable sections of the web, localized search engines can also provide more precise and complete search capabilities over their respective domains.
To evaluate performance, we measure the difference between the current global PageRank estimate and the global PageRank, as a function of the number of pages crawled.
In general , the PageRank
