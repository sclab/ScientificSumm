The problem with the latter method is in the choice of the ( + 1) length starting vector, ν. Consequently, the PageRank estimate given by the simple method differs from the true PageRank by at least 2αxj, where xj is the  PageRank of page j.
We will next show that if only the ‘flow" term, (˜uT j f)z, is considered, then the resulting method is very similar to a heuristic proposed by Cho et al.
The L1NormDiff method is called on the components of these vectors which correspond to the pages in L , and it estimates the value of
