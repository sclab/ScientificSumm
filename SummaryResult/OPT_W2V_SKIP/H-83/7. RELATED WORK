However, their experiments differ from our work in that our node selection algorithms do not use (or have access to) global PageRank values.
also experiment within a similar crawling framework in [2], but quantify their results by comparing Kendall"s rank  correlation between the PageRanks of the current set of crawled pages and those of the entire global graph.
Many algorithmic improvements for computing exact  PageRank values have been proposed [9, 10, 14].
Whereas our framework seeks to minimize the difference between the global and local PageRank , the objective used in [ 6 ] is to crawl the
