Furthermore, The DUDE architecture for scalable distribution can be applied beyond UDDI to any Grid Service Discovery mechanism.
DUDE enables consumers to query multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries.. Based on preliminary prototype on PlanetLab, we believe that DUDE architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling issues.
The standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids Even though UDDI has been the de facto
