The Q upper bound is derive by running an algorithm that assumes the volume is Vmin .
For the upper bound, we can get a √ R competitive ratio, by buying all the shares once the price drops below √ Rpmin .
( Sketch of Theorem 4 ) The algorithm simply sells ut = ( vt/Vmin ) N shares at time t. The total number of shares sold U is clearly more than N and U = t ut = t ( vt/Vmin ) N = ( V/Vmin ) N ≤ QN The average price is V WAPA ( S ) =
