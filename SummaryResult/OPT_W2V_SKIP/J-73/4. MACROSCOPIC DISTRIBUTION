In the volume distribution model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an online  algorithm A for selling N shares that using only knowledge of an approximation ˜Pvol of Pvol achieves RVWAP(A, Pvol ) ≤ 2C(Pbins vol , ˜Pbins vol ).
, Vmax ) to log(Q) (for distributions Pvol in which the total daily volume is equally likely to fall in any one of these intervals).
On the other hand, if Pvol is exponential, then Pbins vol is uniform, leading to an O(log(Q)) competitive ratio, just as in the more adversarial price-volume setting discussed earlier.
We emphasize that in these
