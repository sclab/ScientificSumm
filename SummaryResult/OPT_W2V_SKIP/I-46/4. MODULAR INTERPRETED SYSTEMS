, ∼k for some arbitrary  accessibility relations ∼i over St. By Proposition 3, there exists a MIS S ˆM with global states Q such that ˆM = cegs(S ˆM , Q) is isomorphic to ˆM.
The unfolding of a MIS S for initial states Q ⊆ Stg to a CEGS cegs ( S , Q ) = Agt , St , Π , π , Act , d , o , ∼1 , ... , ∼k is defined as follows : • Agt = { 1 , ... , k } and Act = Act , • St is the set of
