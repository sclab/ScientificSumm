A slightly different variant of  concurrent programs can be defined via synchronous product of programs, so that all agents play simultaneously.5 Unfortunately, under such interpretation, no direct interaction between agents" actions can be modeled at all.
And it is almost as difficult to plug components in and out of an interpreted system, as for an ordinary CTL or ATL model, since the local activity of an agent is completely merged with his interaction with the rest of the system.
On the other hand , they are in many ways difficult to use to describe an actual system : â€¢
