However, as we argue in this paper, few existing representation languages are both modular, compact and computationally grounded on the one hand, and allow for representing properties of both knowledge and strategic ability, on the other.
The semantics of logics like the ones presented in Section 2 are usually defined over explicit models (Kripke structures) that enumerate all possible (global) states of the system.
Multi-agent systems are open systems, in the sense that agents interact with an environment only partially known in advance.
The structure of the paper is as follows.
