For example, the document vectors may be combined with equal weighting, as in Rocchio, or by query likelihood, as may be done using the Relevance Model1 .
Current algorithms for pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) tend to follow the same basic method whether we use  vector space-based algorithms such as Rocchio"s formula [16], or more recent language modeling approaches such as  Relevance Models [10].
With this in mind , we wish to treat many important quantities calculated by the retrieval system , whether a relevance score for a document , or a weight for a query expansion term , as random
