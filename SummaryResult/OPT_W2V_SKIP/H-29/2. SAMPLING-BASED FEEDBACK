Second, sampling is an effective way to estimate basic properties of the feedback posterior distribution, which can then be used for improved model combination.
Our sample space is the set of all possible language  models LF that may be output as feedback models.
We assume that the output of the feedback algorithm is a vector of term weights to be used to add or reweight the terms in the  representation of the original query, with the vector normalized to form a probability distribution.
Although the Dirichlet is a unimodal distribution , and in general quite limited in its expressiveness in
