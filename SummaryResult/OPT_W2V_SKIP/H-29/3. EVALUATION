When query variants are turned off and the  original query is used by itself with document sampling, there is little net change in average precision, a small decrease in P10 for 3 out of the 4 topic sets, but a significant drop in robustness for all topic sets.
In this section we present results confirming the usefulness of estimating a feedback model distribution from weighted resampling of top-ranked documents, and of combining the feedback models obtained from different small changes in the original query.
This happens , for example , even with the Relevance Model approach that is part of
