System-3: this system is the same as system-1 except that it uses the new detection procedure which is based on indexing-tree.
The best system (system-5) has a minimum normalized cost 0.5012, which is 0.0797 better than system-1, and also better than any other results previously reported for this dataset [8, 13].
Further more, system-5 only needs 1.05e+8 comparing times which is 14.9% of system-1.
System-4: implemented based on the approach presented in section 5.1, i.e., terms are reweighted according to the distance between term distributions in a cluster and all stories.
