Lam et al build up previous query representations of story clusters, each of which corresponds to a topic [7].
When a new story was encountered, it was processed immediately to extract term features and a query representation of the story"s content is built up.
A marginal increase in effectiveness was achieved when the combined representation was used.
[8] extended a basic incremental TF-IDF model to include  sourcespecific models, similarity score normalization based on document-specific averages, similarity score normalization based on source-pair specific averages, term reweighting based on inverse event frequencies, and segmentation of documents.
Good improvements on TDT
