In contrast, the natural formulations of the kidney exchange problem (with L = 3) take at least cubic space in the number of patients to even model, and therefore memory becomes a bottleneck much before time does when using standard tree search, such as  branch-andcut in CPLEX, to tackle the problem.
However, the kidney  exchange clearing problem (with a limit of 3 or more on  cycle size) is different from the combinatorial auction clearing problem in significant ways.
Other variations one can solve for include finding various forms of fault tolerant ( non-disjoint ) collections of cycles in the event that
