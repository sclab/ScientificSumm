However, at 5000 vertices, this effect starts to be offset by the additional column generation that must be performed.
We begin with the following settings (all optimizations are switched on): Category Setting Column Seeder Combination of greedy exchange and maximum-weight matching heuristics, and random walk seeder (400,000 cycles).
The first algorithm is CPLEX on the full cycle  formulation.
By taking advantage of the properties of our problem, we manage to clear a market with 10,000 patients in about the same time it would otherwise have taken to clear a 6000 patient market. 
In each of the next two algorithms ,
