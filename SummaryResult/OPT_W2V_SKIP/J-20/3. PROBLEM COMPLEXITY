It is easy to see then that in a perfect cover, each gadget ti contributes cycles  according to the cases above: ti ∈ M, or ti /∈ M. Hence, there exists a perfect 3D-Matching in the original instance. 
One straightforward idea is to construct a tripartite graph with vertex sets X ∪ Y ∪ Z and directed edges (xa, yb), (yb, zc), and (zc, xa) for each triple ti = {xa, yb, zc} ∈ T. However, it is not too hard to see that this encoding fails because a perfect cycle cover may include a cycle with no corresponding triple.
Given
