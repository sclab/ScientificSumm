We consider the problem of analyzing word trajectories in both time and frequency domains, with the specific goal of identifying important and less-reported, periodic and  aperiodic words.
We extensively  evaluated our methods on the 1-year Reuters News Corpus [3] and showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic and periodic events.
A set of words with identical trends can be grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely  unsupervised manner.
All of the above methods can be  applied to time series data in general.
In this paper , we 1 ) first applied spectral analysis to categorize features
