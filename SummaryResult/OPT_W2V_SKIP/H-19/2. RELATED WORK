Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every  single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.
Their focus was on detecting multiple  periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.
Moreover , most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types , identifying novel sentences [ 6 ] for new events , etc. ,
