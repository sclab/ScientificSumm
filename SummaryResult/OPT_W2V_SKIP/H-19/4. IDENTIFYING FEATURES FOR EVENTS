(Dominant Power Spectrum) The  dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.
This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).
The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3 ( a ) , from which we can observe that
