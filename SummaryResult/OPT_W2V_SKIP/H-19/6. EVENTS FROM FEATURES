6.1 Feature Correlation If two features fi and fj are representative of the same event, they must satisfy the following necessary conditions: 1. fi and fj are identically distributed: yfi âˆ¼ yfj .
The set of features similar to fi can then collectively describe an event.
(1) Since KL-divergence is not symmetric, we define the  similarity between between fi and fj as the maximum of KL(fi|fj ) and KL(fj |fi).
Note that our UG algorithm only requires one data-dependant parameter , the boundary between high and low power spectrum , to be set once , and this parameter can be
