From the point of view of ontology building, this work is a first step showing the relevance of our approach.
After being presented as a promising solution, ensuring model quality and their terminological richness, ontology building from textual corpus analysis is difficult and costly.
Our system makes use of a terminological network  resulting from an analysis made by Syntex.
In other words this algorithm introduces  inThe Sixth Intl.
The current state of our software allows to produce simple structures, to propose them to the ontologist and to make them evolve depending on the  modifications he made.
We proposed an approach
