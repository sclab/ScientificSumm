All shows the number of experimental sets in which there was no statistical difference between the three heuristics and a random allocation strategy one must redo the work, thus wasting precious time which might not be available close to a deadline.
Note that a static environment was used in each of these experiments, as we wanted to see the performance of the arrival rate and deadline slack on each of the three heuristics.
We noted the number of times that a heuristic performed the best or was in a group that performed statistically better than the rest.
