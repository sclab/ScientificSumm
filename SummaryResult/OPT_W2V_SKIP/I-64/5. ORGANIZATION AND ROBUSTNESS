There are two approaches commonly used to achieve robustness in multiagent systems: 1. the Survivalist Approach [12], which involves replicating  domain agents in order to allow the replicas to take over should the original agents fail; and 2. the Citizen Approach [7], which involves the use of special monitoring agents (called Sentinel Agents) in order to detect agent failure and dynamically startup new agents in lieu of the failed ones.
The former consists of the information about the local and managerial roles of the agent while the latter is composed of the methods that are being scheduled and executed and
