On the other hand, if b is the offering agent at t = n − 1, it uses APPROX-TRADEOFFB to obtain the approximate equilibrium  package.
Hence the time complexity of finding the approximate equilibrium offer for the first time period is O(nm/ 2 ).
In the same way for t < n − 1, the offering agent (say a) uses APPROX-TRADEOFFA to find an approximate equilibrium package that gives b a utility of Ub ([¯at+1 ,¯bt+1 ], t + 1).
If there is more than one package that solves Equation 3 , then TRADEOFFA returns any one of them ( because agent a gets
