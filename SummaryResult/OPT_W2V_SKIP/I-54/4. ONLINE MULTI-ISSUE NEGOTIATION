This algorithm takes the values of ka i and kb i one at a time and generates an approximate solution to the above knapsack problem.
Note that the subscript m is used to indicate the fact that this difference depends on m. We now describe the protocol for online negotiation and then obtain an approximate equilibrium.
Since the latter has time complexity linear in m , the time complexity of ONLINE-TRADEOFFA and ONLINETRADEOFFB is also linear in m. It is worth noting that , for the 0-1 knapsack problem , the lower bound on the expected difference between the optimum
