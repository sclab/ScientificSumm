Specifically, we first showed that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem even in a complete information  setting.
Finally, we extended the analysis to online negotiation where the issues  become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about the features of these issues.
It will be interesting to analyze the case where ka c and kb c have other, possibly different, probability  distributions.
We then presented approximately optimal negotiation  strategies and showed that they form an equilibrium.
Thus , the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate the issues between themselves so as
