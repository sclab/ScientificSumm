Given this, we consider indivisible issues and first analyze the strategic behaviour of agents to obtain the equilibrium strategies for the case where all the issues for negotiation are known a priori to both agents.
An equally important problem, especially in the context of software agents, is to find the time  complexity of computing the equilibrium offers.
Finally, we extend the analysis to online negotiation where different issues become  available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
For the former , the problem for the agents is to decide how to split
