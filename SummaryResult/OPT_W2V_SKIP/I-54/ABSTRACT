Then, we analyse their time  complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem, even in a complete information setting.
The time complexity of the approximate equilibrium strategies is O(nm/ 2 ) where n is the negotiation deadline and the relative error.
Here different agents value different issues differently.
For such negotiations, we first obtain the  equilibrium strategies for the case where the issues for negotiation are known a priori to the parties.
The agents have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors.
These approximate strategies also have polynomial time complexity.
Finally ,
