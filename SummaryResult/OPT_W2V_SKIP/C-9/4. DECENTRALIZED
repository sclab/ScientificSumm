In fact it can be needless as the services might not use all the assigned resources but the diffusive algorithm caused the limit overrun by equally balancing the free  resources of all supported service environments.
In this case the resource consumption has to be reduced  either by migrating the service to another domain and its  depended home environment or simply by bounding resource usage and if this is not possible, stopping the service.
The resource management can be structured into the following different tasks : • Adding and changing the assigned resources of a service environment • Automatic placement of
