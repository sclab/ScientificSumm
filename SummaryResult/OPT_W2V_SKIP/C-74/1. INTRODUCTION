Traditionally, the most frequently used middleware  primitives for communication assume the simultaneous presence of both end points on a network, since the stability and  pervasiveness of the networking infrastructure is not an  unreasonable assumption for most wired environments.
Indeed, some research has already led to the  adaptation of traditional middleware platforms to mobile settings, mainly to provide integration between mobile devices and existing fixed networks in a nomadic (i.e., mixed)  environment [4].
Aside from the intellectual challenge in supporting this model , this work is also interesting because there are a number of practical application domains in allowing inter-community communication
