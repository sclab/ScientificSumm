In  particular, the synchronous communication paradigms often  employed in standard middleware do not appear to be  particularly suited to ad-hoc environments, in which not even the intermittent availability of a backbone network can be assumed.
Message oriented middleware for traditional systems has been developed and used to provide an asynchronous paradigm of communication for distributed systems, and, recently, also for some specific mobile computing systems.
Instead, asynchronous communication seems to be a generally more suitable paradigm for such  environments.
In this paper , we present our experience in designing , implementing and evaluating EMMA ( Epidemic Messaging Middleware for ad-hoc
