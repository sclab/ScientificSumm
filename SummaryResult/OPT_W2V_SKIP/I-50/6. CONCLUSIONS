We add the new notion of plausibility to the logic of CTLK [19], and obtain a language which  enables reasoning about what can (or must) plausibly happen.
We use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates.
We also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility  update operator (in a way similar to [13]).
As a consequence, we suggest that the framework we propose may prove suitable for modeling, design, and analysis resource-bounded agents in general.
In this paper a notion of plausible behavior is considered ,
