Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all CTLKP models.
In that case we have Baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ, because the set of states to be considered becomes empty.
A CTLKP model is plausibly serial (or p-serial) for agent a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path  according to a, i.e.
It is easy to see that the axiom is not valid in general: as we have no restrictions on plausibility sets Υa, it may be as well that Υa = ∅.
Then Kaϕ → Baϕ is strongly valid
