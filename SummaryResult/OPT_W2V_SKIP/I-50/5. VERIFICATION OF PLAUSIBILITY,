First of all, we get rid of the belief operators (due to  Theorem 15), replacing every occurrence of Baϕ with KaPl a(E f → ϕ).
We follow this idea here, studying the complexity of model checking CTLKP formulae against CTLK models (which can be seen as a compact representation of CTLKP  models in which all the paths are assumed plausible), with the underlying idea that plausibility sets, when needed, must be defined explicitly in the object language.
In general, model checking CTL+ (and also CTLK+) is ΔP 2 -complete.
Now , it is enough to define checking M ,
