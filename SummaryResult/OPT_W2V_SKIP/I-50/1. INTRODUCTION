We also show how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator, and we study properties of such updates.
In this paper, we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior: this notion is added to the language of CTLK [19], which is a  straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5].
That is , some behaviors of the system can be assumed plausible and others implausible , with the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be ignored in practical
