Figure 3 presents the results of these two approaches When full-text pages are used, the technique using individual classifications of search results evidently outperforms the bundling approach by a wide margin.
Recent studies estimate the average length of web queries to be just under 3 words2 , which is lower than in our test sets.
(1)Queries containing random strings, such as telephone numbers - these queries do not yield coherent search results, and so the latter cannot help classification (around 5% of queries were of this kind).
The queries in the two sets differ in their classification difficulty.
