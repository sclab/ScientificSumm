We may instead estimate the parameters ∆ = {δ1, ..., δ|V |} by  maximizing the likelihood of the query given the mixture model of p(q|ΛQ) and p(q|U), where ΛQ is the true query model to generate the query and p(q|U) is a query background model as discussed in Section 2.2.3.
Existing work on language model smoothing has already shown that different types of queries should be smoothed differently according to how  discriminative the query terms are.
With Poisson language modeling, we show that it is possible to model the mixture background without paying for the heavy computational cost.
