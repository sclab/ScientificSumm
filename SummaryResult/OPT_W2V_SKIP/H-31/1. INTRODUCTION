In Section 2, we introduce the new family of query generation models with Poisson distribution, and present various smoothing  methods which lead to different retrieval functions.
In particular, a key difference is that the Poisson model can naturally accommodate  perterm smoothing, which is hard to achieve with a multinomial model without heuristic twist of the semantics of a  generative model.
As in the existing work on multinomial language models, smoothing is critical for this new family of models.
However , multivariate Bernoulli also has one potential advantage over multinomial from the viewpoint of retrieval : in a multinomial distribution ,
