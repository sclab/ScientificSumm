With term dependent coefficients, the performance of the Jelinek-Mercer Poisson model is improved in most cases.
Clearly, using K-Mixture to model the background model outperforms the single  Poisson background model in most cases, especially for verbose queries where the improvement is statistically significant.
Since the Dirichlet Smoothing for multinomial language model and the Gamma Smoothing for Poisson language model lead to the same  retrieval formula, the performance of these two models are jointly presented.
4.3 Term Dependent Smoothing To test the effectiveness of the term dependent  smoothing, we conduct the following two experiments.
Their method managed to find coefficients specific
