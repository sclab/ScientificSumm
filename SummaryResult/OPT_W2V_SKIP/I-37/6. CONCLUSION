Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed  learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.
This is of course  inadequate if we want to evaluate our method in terms of the total effort required for producing a certain quality of  learning results.
In systems composed of completely different agents the circumstances under which successful information exchange can be achieved might be very different from those described here , and much more complex communication and reasoning methods may be necessary to achieve a
