We can then calculate the maximum theoretical number of active clients CUMi ⋅= in each domain as well as M, for the whole conference as CUdM ⋅⋅= .
We can specify no more than an upper bound on the number of clients acceptable, given the number of active domains d. 7.1 Conferencing with only One Level of CSs In this subsection, we consider that we have only one CS, i.e., a unique M-CS in each domain.
