So a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications.
The following are of particular concern in the process: • Ease of use: Conferencing must be simple; users need no domain expertise.
• Scalability: Conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.
The above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide Sections 3 and 4) and will steer the VCE design. 
Application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.
• Interactivity : In
