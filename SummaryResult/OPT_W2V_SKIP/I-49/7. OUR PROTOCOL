This equilibrium consists of the following choices: first a proposes P3 ; player 1 rejects this offer; a proposes then P2 and both players 1 and 2 accepts otherwise they are threatened to  receive the worse offer P1 for them.
Note that P is determined using all players general constraints on the proposals and Q.
Therefore , our cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue protocol is the following : Protocol P. • At the beginning we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before , considering Ψk ( Pt ) and Ψk (
