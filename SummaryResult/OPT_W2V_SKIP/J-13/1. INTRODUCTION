Currently, the most general class of tractable combinatorial auctions has been singled out by modelling interactions among bidders with the notion of item graph, which is a graph whose nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any 152 Figure 1: Example MaxWSP problem: (a) Hypergraph H I0,B0 , and a packing h for it; (b) Primal graph for H I0,B0 ; and, (c,d) Two item graphs for H I0,B0 .
Let us note that the hypergraph representation H I , B of a combinatorial auction I , B is also useful to make
