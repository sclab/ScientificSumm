To help the intuition, we observe that having a vertex of the form w(x,y) in TD corresponds to the selection of an edge from node x to node y in the Hamiltonian path.
Notice that each of the above hyperedges but those of the form Sx and Tx contains exactly two nodes.
Let G be an arbitrary item graph for HG, and let TD = T, Ï‡ be a 3-width tree decomposition of G (note that, because of the cliques, e.g., on the nodes {bsx, bx, bx, bdx}, any item graph for HG has treewidth 3 at least).
