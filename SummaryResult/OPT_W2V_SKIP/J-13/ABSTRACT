In fact, the tractability of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed treewidth exists (and if so, computing one) was left as a crucial open problem.
Note that many item graphs might be associated with a given combinatorial auction, depending on the edges selected for guaranteeing the connectedness.
While this problem is in general  NPhard, it is known to be feasible in polynomial time on those instances whose associated item graphs have bounded treewidth (called structured item graphs).
In this paper , we solve this problem by proving that the existence of a structured item graph is computationally
