In the light of this observation, we note that proving some  approximability results for structured item graphs requires a deep understanding of the approximability of query  decompositions, which is currently missing in the literature.
We have solved the open question of determining the complexity of computing a structured item graph  associated with a combinatorial auction scenario.
Finally, an other interesting question is to assess whether the structural decomposition techniques discussed in the  paper can be used to efficiently deal with generalizations of the winner determination problem.
For some special, yet relevant cases, a highly parallelizable algorithm is also discussed.
