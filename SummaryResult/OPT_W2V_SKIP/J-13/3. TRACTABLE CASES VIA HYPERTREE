Then, the result follows, since in the top-down phase, the packing hr giving the maximum weight over χ(Tr) = E(H) is first included in h∗ , and then extended at each node c with the packing hhv,c conformingly with hv and such that the maximum value of v hv is achieved.
Note that the size of Hv is bounded by (|E(H)| + 1)k , since each node in λ(v) is either left uncovered in a  packing or is covered with precisely one of the hyperedges in χ(v) ⊆ E(H).
Therefore , h∗ is a packing for
