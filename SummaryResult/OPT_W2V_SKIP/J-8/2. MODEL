An extension parallel graph (EPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 →e G2, where G1 and G2 are 5 We limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti and payment only on those edges.
In a general connection game the actions Σi of player i is a payment vector pi , where pi ( e ) is how much player i is offering to contribute to the cost of edge e.5 Given a profile p , any edge
