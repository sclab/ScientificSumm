From a computational game theory point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior.
As far as we know, we are the first to provide a topological characterization for equilibrium existence in multi-commodity and single-source network games.
Yet , [ 1 ] have identified two broad families of games , namely job scheduling and network formation , where a strong equilibrium always exists and the SPoA is significantly lower than the price of anarchy (
