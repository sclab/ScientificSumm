Let S be a SE in Λ1 that minimizes the cost of players in T2 (such a SE exists by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.2).
This game has a unique NE where S1 = {e, c}, S2 = {b, f}, and each player has a cost of 5.7 However,  consider the following coordinated deviation S .
For the lower bound of H ( n ) we observe that in the example presented in [ 2 ] , the unique Nash equilibrium is also a strong equilibrium , and therefore k-SPoA = H ( n ) for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
