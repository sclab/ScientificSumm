Our main existence results are the following: (1) For a single source and sink we show that there is always a strong equilibrium (both for fair and general connection games).
We study the graph topologies that guarantee the existence of a strong equilibrium (where no coalition can improve the cost of each of its members) regardless of the specific costs on the edges.
As for the quality of the strong equilibrium we show that in any fair connection games the cost of a strong equilibrium is Î˜ ( log n ) from the optimal solution , where n is the
