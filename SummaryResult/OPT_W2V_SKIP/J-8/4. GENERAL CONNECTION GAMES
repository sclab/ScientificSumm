First we show how to find a sub-tree T of T∗ , such that for any edge e, the payments of players with sinks in T∗ e is more than the cost of T∗ e ∪ {e}.
We will show that there exists a sub-tree T of T∗ , that connects a subset of players Γ ⊆ N, and a new set of payments ¯p, such that for each i ∈ Γ, ci(¯p) < ci(p).
Next we show that no player k > i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti.
What remain is to find payments ¯p
