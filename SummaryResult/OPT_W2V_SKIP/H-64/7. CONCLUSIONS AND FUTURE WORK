Instead of clustering documents to find topics and then fitting a model to the learned clusters, our goal is to expand the unsupervised portion of our analysis beyond a narrow subset of the collection, such as The Editor"s Desk.
In current work we have defined algorithms to identify  documents likely to help the topic discovery task.
However, we also found evidence that learning topics from a subset of the collection may lead to overfitted models.
Finally , then , in future work we will build on the user studies undertaken by Marchionini and Brunk in efforts to evaluate
