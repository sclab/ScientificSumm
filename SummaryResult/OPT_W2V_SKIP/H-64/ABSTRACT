This paper describes ongoing research into the application of machine learning techniques for improving access to  governmental information in complex digital libraries.
Under the auspices of the GovStat Project, our goal is to identify a small number of semantically valid concepts that adequately spans the intellectual domain of a collection.
In statistical and user-based studies, human-created keywords provide significant improvements in concept learning over both title-only and full-text representations.
Second, automatically derived  documentconcept relationships are a necessary precondition for  realworld deployment of many dynamic interfaces.
