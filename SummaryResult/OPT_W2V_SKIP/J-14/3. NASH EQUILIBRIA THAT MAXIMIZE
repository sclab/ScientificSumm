It  follows that to find a Nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff, we have to maximize Pk−1 i=1 Ti subject to conditions u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui) for i = 1, .
For the base case i = 0, note that u0 = 0 by the previous claim (recall that x , x are selected so that x , x = 0, 1) and consider the triple (U0, V0, U1).
It is easy to check that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the vector (u, 1/2, f(u)) is a Nash equilibrium.
