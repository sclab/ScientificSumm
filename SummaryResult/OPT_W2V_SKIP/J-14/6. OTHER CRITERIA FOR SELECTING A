If the set S is non-empty, we can find a Nash equilibrium ˆs that is -close to satisfying the payoff bounds and is within from ˆs with respect to the total payoff by combining the algorithms of Section 4 and Section 5.
We conclude that whenever such a Nash  equilibrium s exists, our algorithm outputs a Nash equilibrium t that satisfies |EPVi (t) − EPVj (t)| ≤ ξ + 4 for all i, j = 1, .
Finally, as in the proof of Theorem 3, we use ml,k n to select the best discrete Nash equilibrium subject to the payoff constraints.
