Lemma 3 implies Pn i=1 |EPVi (s) − EPVi (t)| ≤ 24nPmaxδ, so by choosing δ < /(24nPmax), or, equivalently, setting N > 24nPmax/ , we can ensure that the total expected payoff for the strategy profile t is within from optimal.
That is, we cannot hope to have an algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium with total payoff at least (1 − )M(G).
In this case, for any strategy profile the payoff to player i is at least Pmin, so the total payoff in the social-welfare maximizing Nash equilibrium s satisfies M(G) ≥ nPmin.
We will now show that
