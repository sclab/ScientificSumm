Further work in this vein could include extensions to the kinds of guarantees sought for Nash equilibria, such as guaranteeing total payoffs for subsets of players, selecting equilibria in which some players are receiving significantly higher payoffs than their peers, etc.
Then checking if there is a Nash equilibrium in which none of the players assigns a  nonzero probability to his third action is equivalent to checking if there exists a Nash equilibrium that satisfies the payoff bounds in the original game, and Section 5.1 shows that finding an exact solution to this problem requires new ideas.
Our approach is
