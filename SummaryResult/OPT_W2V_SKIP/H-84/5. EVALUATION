¯ Dependency pairs ( ´Åµ): These are the set of all ordered pairs of stories ´× × µ such that there is a dependency from the event of × to the event of × in the model Å.
¯ Cluster Recall(CR): It is the probability that two randomly selected stories × and × are in the same system-event given that they are in the same true event.
Formally, ´Åµ ´× × µ × × ¾ Ë ´× µ ´× µ (5) where is the function in Å that maps stories to events as defined in equation 4.
