On the whole, we observe that the surface-level features we used capture the dependencies to a  reasonable level achieving a best value of 0.72 DF on the test set.
Â¯ cos+1-lnk: Single link comparison (see equation 16) is used where similarity of two clusters is the maximum of all story pairs, other configurations are the same as the baseline run.
As a baseline, we use a combination of the baselines in each  components, i.e., cos for clustering and complete-link for dependencies.
Then we modeled only the dependencies by providing to the system the true clusters and running only the dependency
