6.2.2 Simple Thresholding This model is an extension of the complete link model with an additional constraint that there is a dependency between any two events Ù and Ú only if the average cosine similarity between event Ù and event Ú is greater than a threshold Ì.
The direction of dependency is determined by the time-ordering of the first stories in the respective events.
We have three different ways to compute the similarity between two events Ù and Ú : ¯ Average link : In this case the similarity is the average of the similarities of all pairs of stories
