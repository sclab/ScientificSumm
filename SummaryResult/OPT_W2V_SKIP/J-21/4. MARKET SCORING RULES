Consider the restricted projection game with some prior probability distribution F over possible values of p. Then , there is a probability distribution G with the same support as F , and a strictly positive constant c that depends only on F such that : • ( i ) For any collection X of moves , the expected profits are related by : EF ( SEG-PROFIT ( X ) ) = cEG ( SSR-PROFIT ( X ) ) • ( ii ) For any collection X , and any measurable information set I ⊆ [ 0 , 1 ] ,
