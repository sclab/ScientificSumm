We also examined counting only the pairs judged with 1 as positive examples and did not find a significant change in the relative performance of the tested methods.

Therefore we could not use standard pooling as an evaluation method since we did not control the way the pairs were selected and could not precisely establish the set of ads from which the placed ads were selected.
Instead , in our evaluation for each page we consider only those
