To represent such a game without using negative literals, we will need 2n rules for n players: we need a rule of value 1 for each individual agent, a rule of value âˆ’1 for each pair of agents to counter the double-counting, a rule of value 1 for each triplet of agents, etc., similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle.
Consider a unit game over all the agents N. As explained in 3.1, this game can be represented in linear space using MC-nets with negative literals.
Given a game represented as a MC-net , we can interpret the set of rules that
