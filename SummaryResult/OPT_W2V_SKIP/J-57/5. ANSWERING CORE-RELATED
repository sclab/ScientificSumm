Core-Membership in MC-nets is in the class of coNP since any set of agents S of which v(S) > x(S) will serve as a certificate to show that x does not belong to the core.
If this is so for all nodes in the tree, the payoff vector x is in the core.
The payoff vector x is not in the core if and only if the r-values at some node i for some group S is negative.
As both the base set and the limiting set of the r-values of node j and node i differ by {
