On the other hand, there is an efficient algorithm for  computing the Shapley value of the game, and for determining whether the core is empty under the restriction of positive edge weights.
An  example of a game that cannot be represented is the unit game, where v(S) = 1 as long as S = ∅.
For a game to have a non-empty core, it must satisfy the property of balancedness, defined as follows.
This set of weights , ( λS ) S⊆N , is a balanced collection if for all i ∈ N , S⊆N λS ( 1S ) i
