One direction to increase the conciseness of MC-nets is to allow the definition of  equivalent classes of agents, similar to the idea of extending Bayes nets to probabilistic relational models.
Other than the algorithm for Core-Non-Emptiness in [4] under the restriction of non-negative edge weights, and that in [2] for  superadditive games when the value of the grand coalition is given, we are not aware of any explicit description of algorithms for core-related problems in the literature.
We have also developed an efficient  algorithm for the computation of the Shapley values for this representation.
More concretely , we can specify
