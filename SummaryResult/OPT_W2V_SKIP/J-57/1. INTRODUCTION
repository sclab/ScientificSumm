For example, for the recommendation system game, a highly compact  representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products, and let the algorithms that operate on the representation to compute the values of coalitions  appropriately.
The ideal representation should be fully expressive, i.e., it should be able to represent any coalitional games, use as little space as possible, have efficient algorithms for  computation, and be easy to use.
compute the value of the private information of the agents is worth to the system using the solution concept of the Shapley value ( definition can be found
