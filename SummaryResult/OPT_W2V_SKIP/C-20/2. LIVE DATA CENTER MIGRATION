Because of the difficulty of moving network level (i.e., IP  addresses) in a routed non-LAN environment, use of live server  migration as a management tool has been limited to the LAN  environments [22].
2.2 Networking Requirements From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server  migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location  immediately after the migration has completed.
Specifically , to support live server migration we propose a remote replication system where the initial transfer of data between the data centers
