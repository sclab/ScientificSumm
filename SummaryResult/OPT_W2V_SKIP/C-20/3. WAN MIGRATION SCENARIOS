Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the  migration of data storage to the new data center.
To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is  expected to happen shortly.
Requiring Storage Migration : When storage has to also be replicated , it is critical that we achieve the right balance between performance ( impact on the application ) and
