In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated  network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.
As indicated earlier, these techniques assume that migration is being done on a LAN.
Most virtual machine software, such as Xen [8] and VMWare [14] support live migration of VMs that involve extremely short downtimes ranging from tens of milliseconds to a second; details of Xen"s live migration techniques are discussed in [8].
At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate applications within virtual
