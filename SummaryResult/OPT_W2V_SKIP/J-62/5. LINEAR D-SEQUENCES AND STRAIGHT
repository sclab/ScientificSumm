Clearly we can apply the above conclusion to v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc and get a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCv w bc with −→a simple and δ(−→a ) ≤ v (b) − v (c).
For b, c ∈ A and v, w ∈ D we write LCvw bc for the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Lvw .
So assume b = c. If Db ∩Dc ∩vw = ∅, we pick an arbitrary x from this set and let −→a = (b, c) ∈ SPbc, −→u = (v, x, w) ∈ Lvw .
We then
