For v, w ∈ D and b, c ∈ A, we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Svw .
The δ-weight of path −→a is defined by δ(−→a ) = k−1X i=1 δaiai+1 .
For −→u ∈ C(−→a ) we define ∆−→a (−→u ) = |−→a |−1 X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)).
A D-sequence of order k is a sequence −→u = (u0, .
For v, w ∈ D we write Svw for the set of (v, w)-sequences.
