, en}, which is the set of vectors in Rn with nonnegative coordinates that sum to 1.
, rn} be the set of row vectors of M and let hM be the single player social choice function with domain R(M) and range {1, 2, .
It is easy to see that D is a convex subset of the set of all functions from Sn to R. The outcome graph Gf is an infinite graph whose vertex set is the outcome set A = Sn.
The first example illustrates that convexity can not be omitted.
The domain is the boundary of a triangle whose
