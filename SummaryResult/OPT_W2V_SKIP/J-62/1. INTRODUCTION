The two hypotheses on the social choice function, that the domain is convex and that the range is finite, can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7.
The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions: for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2, a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F. The functions in F are not truthful, and therefore W-MON is a  necessary condition for truthfulness.
The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions
