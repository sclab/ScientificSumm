Here we show the more general result, conjectured by Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6], that weak monotonicity is sufficient for  functions defined on any convex domain.
Lavi, Mu"alem and Nisan [6] proved the sufficiency of weak  monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] proved sufficiency for order-based  domains with range constraints and for domains defined by other special types of linear inequality constraints.
Roberts [10] showed that it is sufficient for all  social choice functions whose domain is unrestricted.
Weak monotonicity is a simple necessary condition for a social choice function
