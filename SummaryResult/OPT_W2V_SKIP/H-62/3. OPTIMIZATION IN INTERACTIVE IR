Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic  models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the  current user model and obtain mâˆ— t based on all the useful  information.
The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.
For example , if the user does not want to see redundant documents , the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on
