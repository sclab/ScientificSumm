We have seen that the system is well behaved if the agents all follow a threshold strategy; we now want to show that there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium where they do so (that is, a Nash equilibrium where all the agents use Sk for some k > 0.)
We do this by first showing that, if every other agent is playing a threshold strategy, then there is a best response that is also a threshold strategy (although not  necessarily the same one).
Either k is unique ( that is , there is a unique best response that is also a
