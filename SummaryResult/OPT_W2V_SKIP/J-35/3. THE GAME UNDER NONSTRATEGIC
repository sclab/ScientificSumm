If there are n agents, then the state of the game can be described by identifying how much money each agent has, so we can represent it by an element of Sk,n = {0, .
We averaged 10 runs of the Markov chain for k = 5 where there is enough money for each agent to have $2 starting from a very extreme distribution (every agent has either $0 or $5) and considered the average time needed to come within various distances of the maximum entropy distribution.
Since âˆ†k m is easily seen to be a closed convex set of distributions ,
