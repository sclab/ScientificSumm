Thus we will assume a  monotone Boolean function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} which denotes 21 whether the project succeeds as a function of the success of the n agents" tasks (and is not determined by any set of n−1 agents).
The contract to agent i is thus now given by a scalar value pi ≥ 0 that denotes the payment that i gets in case of project success.
As we would like to focus on results that derived from properties of the success function , in most of the paper we will deal with the case
