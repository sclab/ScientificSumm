Much recent research concerns systems, such as the  Internet, whose components are owned and operated by different parties, each with his own selfish goal.
The field of  Algorithmic Mechanism Design handles the issue of private  information held by the different parties in such computational settings.
Our focus is on cases where complex combinations of the efforts of the agents influence the outcome.
This paper deals with a complementary problem in such settings: handling the hidden actions that are  performed by the different parties.
The principal motivates the agents by offering to them a set of contracts , which together put
