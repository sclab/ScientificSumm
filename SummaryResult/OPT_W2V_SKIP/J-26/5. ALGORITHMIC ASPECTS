By choosing Î³x close enough to 1 2 , we can make sure that player x will enter the optimal contract only for very large values of v, after all other agents are contracted (if we can find the optimal contract for any value, it is easy to find a value for which in the original network the optimal contract is E, by keep doubling the value and asking for the optimal contract.
Given as input a black box for a success function t ( when the costs are identical ) , and a value v , the number of queries
