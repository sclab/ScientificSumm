Thus, the orbit of f is of size at most nl + 1, where nl is the number of agents in h. Part of the proof of the theorem (for the complete proof see [2]), is based on such AOO technology being a special case of a more general family of technologies, in which  disjoint anonymous technologies are And-ed together, as  explained in the next section.
In an OOA technology which is a disjunction of the same anonymous paths ( with the same number of agents , Î³ and c , but over disjoint inputs ) , for any value v
