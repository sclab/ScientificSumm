When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions.
Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.
(This proof proceeds by  reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, Player I must fully identify the actual world through his queries.
In a correlated equilibrium , a player '' s expected payoff generally depends on
