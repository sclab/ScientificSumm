For  completeness, we give a characterization of classical strategically zero-sum games in terms of the rank of a simple matrix  derived from the game"s payoffs, allowing us to efficiently  decide if a given game is strategically zero sum and, if it is, to compute the labels (i, ai).
Then the following are equivalent : ( i ) G is strategically zero sum ; ( ii ) there exist labels ( i , ai ) for every player i ∈ { i , ii } and every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai such that , for all pure strategies
