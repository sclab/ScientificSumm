Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.
Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial  information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world.
Our first result is an efficient  algorithm to find Nash equilibria in unobservable-query  Socratic games with constant-sum worlds, in which the sum of the players" payoffs is independent of their actions.
As in traditional
