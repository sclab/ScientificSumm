In the Socratic game, a pure strategy for Player i consists of a query qi ∈ Qi and a response function mapping any  result of the query qi to a strategy ai ∈ Ai to play.
After learning the results of the queries, the players select strategies a ∈ A and receive as payoffs u wreal i (a) − δi(qi).
Formally , in a correlated equilibrium , for every a ∈ A we must have that ai is a best response to a randomly chosen ˆaii ∈ Aii drawn according to ψ ( ai , ˆaii ) , and
