Additionally, these models can be interpreted as assuming the scores produced by the text classifier have three basic types of empirical behavior - one corresponding to each of the extremely irrelevant, hard to discriminate, and obviously relevant items.
Parametric models generally use assumptions that the data  conform to the model to trade-off flexibility with the ability to estimate the model parameters accurately with little training data.
However, in all of these tasks, the quality of the probability estimates is crucial.
While some of these methods allow the distributions of the documents relevant and irrelevant to the topic to have different variances
