Even in cases where the test distribution differs from the training distribution (Figure 4), A. Laplace still yields a solution that gives a better fit than LogReg (Figure 5), the next best competitor.
In addition, we also compare the error of the classifiers at their default thresholds and with the probabilities.
The parameters are still fit using maximum likelihood estimation, but a model of noisy class labels is used in addition to allow for the possibility that the class was mislabeled.
In order to give the reader a better sense of the behavior of these methods , Figures 4-5 show
