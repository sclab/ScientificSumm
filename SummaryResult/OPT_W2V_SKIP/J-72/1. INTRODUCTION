In contrast, our work shows that given a more general (yet still quite standard) version of demand query than the type they consider, the complexity of preference elicitation is no greater than the complexity of learning.
Introducing this parameter also allows us to guarantee polynomial worst-case  communication, which usually cannot be achieved in the number of goods and agents alone.
It is in the interest of such agents to have auction protocols which require them to bid on as few bundles as possible.
Of course , a one-shot combinatorial auction where agents provide their entire valuation functions at once
