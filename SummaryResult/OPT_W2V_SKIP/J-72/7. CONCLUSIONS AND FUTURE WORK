At the heart of this result is the fact that demand queries may be viewed as modified equivalence queries,  specialized to the problem of preference elicitation.
Our result allows us to apply the wealth of available learning algorithms to the problem of preference elicitation.
If the designer knowns beforehand what types of preferences each agent is likely to exhibit (mostly additive, many substitutes, etc...), she can design learning algorithms tailored to each agents"  valuations and integrate them into an elicitation scheme.
This is the  preference elicitation problem.
In the learning setting , we usually assume that oracles will
