More formally, a representation class (bidding language) C is polynomially interpretable if there exists an algorithm that given as input some v ∈ C and an instance x ∈ X computes the value v(x) in time q(size(v), m), for some fixed polynomial q(·, ·).2 In the intermediate rounds of an (iterative) auction, the auctioneer will have elicited information about the agents" valuation functions via various types of queries.
, Vn can be polynomial-query elicited from value and demand queries if there is a fixed polynomial p ( · , · ) and an algorithm
