If the learning algorithm"s equivalence  queries are all proper, it may then also be possible to provide tight bounds on the communication requirements of the  resulting elicitation algorithm.
Thus the value and demand queries, and the  responses to these queries, are always of polynomial size.
Nisan and Segal [ 12 ] show that for a variety of rich valuation spaces ( such as general and submodular valuations ) , the worst-case communication burden of determining Lindahl prices is exponential in the number of goods , m. The communication burden is measured in terms of the number of bits
