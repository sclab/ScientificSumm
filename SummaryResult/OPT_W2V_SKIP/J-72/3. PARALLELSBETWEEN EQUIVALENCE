Furthermore, Nisan and Segal (Lemma 1, [12]) state that in the worst-case agents" prices must coincide with their valuations (up to a constant), when the valuation class is rich enough to contain dual valuations (as will be the case with most interesting classes).
Since revealing Lindahl prices is a necessary condition for establishing an optimal allocation, and since Lindahl prices contain the same  information as valuation functions (in the worst-case), allowing for dependence on size(v1, .
The agent"s manifest valuations are in fact valid Lindahl prices, and we refer to them as maximal Lindahl prices.
We say
