The  majority valuation is a special case of the r-of-S valuation with r = m/2 and S = M. These valuations are appropriate for representing substitutabilities: once a required set of items has been obtained, no other items can add value.
More  generally, consider the r-of-S family of valuations where bundles have value 1 if they contain at least r items from a specified set of items S âŠ† M, and value 0 otherwise.
To provide this guarantee, r must be known to the algorithm, but S (and k) are unknown.
