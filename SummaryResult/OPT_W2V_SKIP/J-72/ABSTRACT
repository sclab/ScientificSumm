We show that learning algorithms can be used as a basis for  preference elicitation algorithms.
In particular, we obtain an  algorithm that elicits XOR bids with polynomial  communication.
We consider the parallels between the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and the problem of  learning an unknown function from learning theory.
Our conversion procedure  allows us to generate combinatorial auction protocols from learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone DNF, and linear-threshold functions.
We also give conditions under which the resulting algorithms have polynomial communication.
The resulting elicitation  algorithms perform a polynomial number of queries.
