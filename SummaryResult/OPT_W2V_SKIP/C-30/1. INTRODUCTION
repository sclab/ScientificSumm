Rather than sending identical copies of the same data stream to all nodes in a tree and designing a scalable mechanism for recovering from loss, we propose that participants in a multicast overlay cooperate to strategically 282 transmit disjoint data sets to various points in the network.
In both cases, the overhead of maintaining the Bullet mesh and  locating the appropriate disjoint data is limited to 30 Kbps per node, acceptable for our target high-bandwidth, large-scale scenarios.
This ensures that the entire overlay behaves in a congestion-friendly manner , adjusting its transmission rate on a per-connection basis based on prevailing
