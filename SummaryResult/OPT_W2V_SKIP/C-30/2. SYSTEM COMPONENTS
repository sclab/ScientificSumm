This is the process used to ensure that membership in a collect set propagated by a node to its parent is both random and uniformly representative of all members of the sub-tree rooted at that node.
For instance, if multimedia data is being distributed to a set of heterogeneous receivers with variable bandwidth, MDC [17] allows receivers obtaining different subsets of the data to still maintain a usable multimedia stream.
The working set contains sequence numbers of packets that have been successfully received by each node over some period of time.
The main role of the receiver is to send
