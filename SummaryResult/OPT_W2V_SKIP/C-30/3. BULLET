In the general case, our owning strategy attempts to make data disjoint among children subtrees with the guiding premise that, as much as possible, the expected number of nodes receiving a packet is the same across all packets.
To this end, Bullet distributes incoming packets among one or more children in hopes that the expected number of nodes receiving each packet is approximately the same.
In this case, a descendant would receive the packet out of order and may have already recovered it from one of its peers.
This identifies the range of packets that the receiver is currently interested
