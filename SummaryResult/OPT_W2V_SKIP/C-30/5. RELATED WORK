Since its foremost emphasis is reliability, the system does not attempt to improve the bandwidth delivered to the overlay participants by sending disjoint data at each level.
Since Kazaa does not address the multicast  communication model, a large fraction of users downloading the same file would consume more bandwidth than nodes organized into the Bullet overlay structure.
The key design goal of the tree construction mechanism is to have each node be an intermediate node in at most one tree ( while observing both inbound and outbound node bandwidth constraints ) , thereby reducing the impact of a single node
