We compare the results attained by the Human Interest Model that only identify interesting nuggets with the results of the syntactic pattern finding Soft-Pattern model as well as the result of the top performing definitional system in TREC 2005 [13].
The result is also comparable with the result of a human manual run, which attained a F3 score of 0.299 on the same question set [9].
The Human Interest Model clearly outperform both soft pattern and the best TREC 2005 system with a F3 score of 0.303.
Both systems are evaluated the results using the standard scoring methodology for TREC
