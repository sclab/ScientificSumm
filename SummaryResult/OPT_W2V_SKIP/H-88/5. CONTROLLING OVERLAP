In section 8 the algorithm is extended to apply increasing weights, lowering the score, when a term appears in more than one reported element. 
Starting with an element ranking generated by the  baseline method described in the previous section, elements are re-ranked to control overlap by iteratively adjusting the scores of those elements containing or contained in higher ranking elements.
For example, assume a paragraph with score p is reported in step 1.
In equation 1 , xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt , where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and
