Notice also that our value generation algorithm (Figure 5) generates a number of bids that is exponential on the number of items, as might be expected in many situations.
We then compared the  solutions found by both of them to the revenue-maximizing solution as found by CASS when given a set of bids that corresponds to the agents" true valuation.
Although the number of nodes expanded by our algorithms increases as function of the number of items , the actual number of nodes is a much smaller than the worst-case scenario of nn where n is the number of
