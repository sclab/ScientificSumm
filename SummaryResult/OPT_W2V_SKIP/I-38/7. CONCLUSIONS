Moreover, because of the design of the PAUSE auction, the agents in the auction also have an incentive to perform the required computation.
We believe that distributed solutions to the winner  determination problem should be studied as they offer a better fit for some applications as when, for example, agents do not want to reveal their valuations to the auctioneer or when we wish to distribute the computational load among the bidders.
We also found that the revenue  generated by our algorithms increases as function of the number of items in the auction.
With this auction , we can even
