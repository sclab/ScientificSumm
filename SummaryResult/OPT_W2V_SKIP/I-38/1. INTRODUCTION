The PAUSE (Progressive Adaptive User Selection  Environment) auction [4, 5] is one of a few efforts to distribute the problem of winner determination amongst the bidders.
Nevertheless, several  algorithms that have a satisfactory performance for problem sizes and structures occurring in practice have been  developed.
Examples of these algorithms are CASS [3], Bidtree [11] and CABOB [12].
We believe that distributed solutions to the winner determination problem should be studied as they offer a better fit for some  applications as when, for example, agents do not want to reveal their valuations to the auctioneer.
Thus , several approaches and algorithms
