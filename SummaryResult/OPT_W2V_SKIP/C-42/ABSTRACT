In this paper, we provide an account of our efforts in  Gridenabling the ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation methodology.
By pooling the licenses and computing resources across the collaborating institutions using GridWay metascheduler and TIGRE environment, the computational accuracy can be increased while reducing the simulation runtime.
The Schlumberger ECLIPSE software is used for these simulations.
In this approach, an ensemble of geological models and production data of oil fields is used to forecast the dynamic response of oil wells.
We have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology for the TIGRE Grid computing environment.
