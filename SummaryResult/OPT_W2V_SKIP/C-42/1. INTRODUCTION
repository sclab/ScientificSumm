Application description and the need for Grid-enabling EnKF methodology is provided in Section 3.
The secondary goal is to demonstrate the TIGRE capabilities to enhance research and educational opportunities in strategic application areas of interest to the State of Texas.
Within the energy exploration strategic application area, we have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [7] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the TIGRE environment and the GridWay [8] metascheduler.
Section 2 provides an overview of the TIGRE environment and capabilities.
The overall goal of TIGRE is to support local ,
