One of the main advantages of Grid-enabled EnKF simulation is that both the resources and licenses are released back to the pool at the end of each simulation time step unlike in the case of MPI implementation where licenses and nodes are locked until the completion of entire simulation.
GridWay Sub-Job Template In Figure 3, REQUIREMENTS flag is set to choose the resources that satisfy the application requirements.
Therefore , overall waiting time could be shorter in Grid approach which requests single CPU for each sub-job many times compared to MPI implementation that requests large number of CPUs at a
