The simulation runtime of the EnKF methodology depends on the number of geological models used, number of ECLIPSE licenses available, production history of the field, and propagated uncertainties in history matching.
When the available number of licenses is less than the number of models in the ensemble, one or more of the nodes in the MPI group have to handle more than one model in a serial fashion and therefore, it takes longer to complete the simulation.
Historical production response of the field for over 50 years is used in these simulations.
In reservoir modeling , the field is divided
