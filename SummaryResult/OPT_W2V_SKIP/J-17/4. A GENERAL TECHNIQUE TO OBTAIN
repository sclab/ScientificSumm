Theorem 4.4 Suppose algorithm A satisfies the conditions in Algorithm 1 and returns a makespan of at most c·OPT(p) for every p. Then, the algorithm A constructed above is a 2c-approximation, cycle-monotone fractional algorithm.
This conversion works even when the approximation algorithm returns only a fractional schedule (satisfying certain properties) of makespan at most c · OPT(p) for every instance p. We prove truthfulness by showing that the fractional algorithm satisfies cycle  monotonicity (3).
We will show that for every such maximal segment k , k +1, .
Algorithm 1 Let A be any algorithm that on any input p
