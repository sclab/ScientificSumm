This is one of the few known results that shows how to export  approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms in a black-box fashion.
These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain.
Our constructions are novel in two respects.
However, whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in  singledimensional domains, ours is the first work that leverages cycle monotonicity in the multidimensional setting.
This builds upon a technique of [16], and shows the usefulness of fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design.
Second , our randomized
