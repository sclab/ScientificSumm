This is one of the very few known results that use an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem.
Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem.
But for multidimensional domains , almost all positive results have relied on explicit price specifications in order to prove truthfulness ( an exception is the work on unknown single-minded players in combinatorial auctions [ 17 ,
