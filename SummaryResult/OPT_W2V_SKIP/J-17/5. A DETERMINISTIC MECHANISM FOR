So suppose OPT(p) ≥ H. By Claim 5.5, we know that T∗ (p) ≤ OPT(p) + L. If there are no unassigned jobs after step 2 of the algorithm, then the makespan is at most T∗ (p) and we are done.
Now consider the point in the execution of the algorithm on instance p2 just before the last high job is assigned to i in Step 3 (there must be such a job since n2,1 L > 0).
Also none of the jobs that are counted in n2,1 L are assigned by x since each such job j is high
