We present TSAR, a fundamentally different storage architecture that  envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local archiving at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
We argue that existing storage systems are designed primarily for flat hierarchies of homogeneous sensor nodes and do not fully exploit the multi-tier nature of emerging sensor networks, where an application can comprise tens of tethered proxies, each managing tens to hundreds of untethered sensors.
Archival storage of sensor data is necessary for applications that query, mine, and analyze such data for interesting features and trends.
Our experiments demonstrate the benefits and
