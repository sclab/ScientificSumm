For a simple  interval skip graph, however, this maximum value for an entry must be computed over all entries preceding it in the index, as searches may begin anywhere in the data structure, rather than at a distinguished root element.
The main reason for the difference is that skip graphs have a full search structure rooted at each  element, in order to distribute load and provide resilience to system failures in a distributed setting.
In a sparse interval skip graph , updates to a node only propagate towards the Np root elements , for a worst-case cost of Np log2
