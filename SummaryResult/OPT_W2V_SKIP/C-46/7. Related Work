Early work on sensor networks such as Directed Diffusion [17] assumes a system where all useful sensor data was stored locally at each sensor, and spatially scoped queries are routed using geographic co-ordinates to locations where the data is stored.
In order to efficiently access a distributed sensor store, an index needs to be constructed of the data.
Distributed Index of Features in  Sensornets (DIFS [11]) and Multi-dimensional Range Queries in Sensor Networks (DIM [18]) extend the data-centric storage approach to provide spatially distributed hierarchies of indexes to data.
In this section , we review prior work on storage and
