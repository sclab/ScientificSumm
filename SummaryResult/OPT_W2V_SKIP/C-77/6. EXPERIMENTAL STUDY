From these figures, we observe that, whatever the time distribution  followed by the relevant events, both IPT2 and IPT3 exhibit a behavior better than IPT1 (i.e., the total number of  piggybacked triples is lower in IPT2 and IPT3 than in IPT1), even in the worst case (see Figure 3.d).
On the one hand, when observing Figure 3.b where a large number of relevant events are taken in a very short time, IPT2 can save up to 45% of the triples.
The location parameter of the standard normal time distribution has been set so that the occurrence of relevant events is
