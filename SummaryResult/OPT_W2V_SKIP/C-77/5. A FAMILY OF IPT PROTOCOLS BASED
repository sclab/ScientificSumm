ON EVALUABLE CONDITIONS It results from the previous theorem that, if Pi could evaluate K(m, k) when it sends m to Pj, this would  allow us improve the previous IPT protocol in the following way: in rule R2, the triple (k, V Ci[k], IPi[k]) is  transmitted with m only if Â¬K(m, k).
Moreover , rule R3 is appropriately modified to consider only triples carried by m. However , as previously mentioned , Pi can not locally evaluate K ( m , k ) when it is about to send m. More precisely , when Pi sends
