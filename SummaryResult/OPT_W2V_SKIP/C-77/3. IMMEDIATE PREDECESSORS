The intuitive meaning of the next lemma is the following: if e is a receive event receive(m), and pred(e) is not  relevant, the last relevant events in the relevant causal past of e are obtained by merging those of pred(e) and those of send(m) and by taking the latest on each process.
It results from Lemmas 2 and 3 that, if e is a receive event (e = receive(m)), then determining e.IPi  involves information related to the event send(m).
Second , for lastr ( e , j ) to be immediate predecessor of e ,
