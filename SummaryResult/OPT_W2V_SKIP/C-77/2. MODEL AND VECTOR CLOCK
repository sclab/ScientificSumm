If e is the first event produced by Pi, then pred(e) is denoted by ⊥ (meaning that there is no such event), and ∀e ∈ Hi : ⊥ < e. The partial order bH = (H, hb →)  constitutes a formal model of the distributed computation it is associated with.
When a process Pi produces a (relevant) event e, it associates with e a vector timestamp whose value (denoted e.V C) is equal to the current value of V Ci.
Vector Clock Implementation The following implementation of vector clocks [ 5 , 16 ] is based on the observation that ∀i ,
