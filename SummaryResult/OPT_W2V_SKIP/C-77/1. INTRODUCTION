In this paper, we are interested in the restriction of the causality relation to the subset of events defined as being the relevant events of the computation.
More precisely, given two events e and f of a distributed  computation, a crucial problem that has to be solved in a lot of distributed applications is to know whether they are causally related, i.e., if the occurrence of one of them is a consequence of the occurrence of the other.
Usually , according to the problem he focuses on , a designer is interested only in a subset of the events produced
