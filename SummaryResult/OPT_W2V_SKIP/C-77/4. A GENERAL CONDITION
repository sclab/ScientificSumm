4.2 A Necessary and Sufficient Condition We show here that the condition K(m, k) is both  necessary and sufficient to decide which triples of the form (k, send(m).V Ci[k], send(m).IPi[k]) can be omitted in an outgoing message m sent by Pi to Pj.
In such a case, the value m.V C[k] is useless, and could be omitted from the control information transmitted with m by Pi to Pj.
When a process Pi sends m to a process Pj , the condition K ( m , k ) is both necessary and sufficient
