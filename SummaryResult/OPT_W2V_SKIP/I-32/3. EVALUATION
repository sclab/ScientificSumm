As can be learned from [1], Connect-Four has an optimal strategy and a considerable advantage for the player who starts the game (which we call the White player).
A few additional games were manually ignored in the  experiment, due to these problems: a player abandoning the game while the outcome is not final, or a blunt irrational move in the early stages of the game (e.g., not blocking an obvious winning group in the first opening moves).
Intuition would suggest that games in which the action evaluation values were closer to the maximal values will result in more winning games
