The major reason seems to be the imperfect selection of the number of expansion terms, as a function of query clarity.
Thus, more experiments are needed in order to determine the  optimal number of generated expansion keywords, as a function of the query ambiguity level.
Given the algorithms and clarity measures, we implemented the adaptivity procedure by tailoring the amount of expansion terms added to the original query, as a function of its ambiguity in the Web, as well as within user"s PIR.
The newly proposed adaptive personalized query expansion algorithms are denoted as A [ LCO/TF ]
