These elements taken together result in a FSM-like view of ACL specifications where each individual state provides a complete ACL semantics and state  transitions are triggered by observed agent behaviour in order to (1) reflect future expectations based on previous interaction experience and (2) sanction or reward certain kinds of  behaviour.
A mechanism for specifying how meaning evolves with agent behaviour and how this can be used to describe communication-inherent sanctioning and  rewarding mechanisms essential to the design of open MASs.
Finally , none of the existing approaches allows the ACL to specify how to respond to a violation of
