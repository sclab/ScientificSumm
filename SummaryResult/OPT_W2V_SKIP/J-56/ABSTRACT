We then examine the trade-off between robustness and revenue in  different economically motivated auction scenarios for different  constraints on the revenue of repair solutions.
Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution reparability by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker.
Robust solutions can also provide a means of selectively  discriminating against distrusted bidders in a measured manner.
Given a bid withdrawal in a combinatorial auction , finding an alternative repair solution of adequate revenue without causing undue disturbance to the
