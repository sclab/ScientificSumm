Backtracking may then occur for one of two reasons: we cannot extend the assignment to satisfy the given constraints, or the current  partial assignment cannot be associated with a repair solution whose cost of repair is less than Î² should a break occur.
A classical super solution (SS) is a solution to a CSP in which, if a small number of variables lose their values, repair solutions are guaranteed with only a few changes, thus providing solution robustness [9, 10].
An ( a , b ) -super solution is one in which if at most a variables lose
