An analysis of the resultant behavior of  bidders must incorporate the possibility of a bidder winning an item and having it withdrawn in order for the bid-taker to formulate a repair solution after a break elsewhere.
In the case where no robust solutions are found, it is possible to optimize robustness, instead of revenue, by finding a solution of at least a given revenue that minimizes the probability of an  irreparable break.
The impact of such a constraint on revenue of robust solutions is also left for future work.
For many distributions of costs and estimates , equilibrium bidding is
