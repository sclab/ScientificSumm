Consider the example in Table 1, and the optimal expected  revenue in the situation where a single bid may be withdrawn.
A robust solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution.
Our approach can be seen as preventative in that we find an initial allocation of items to bidders which is  robust to bid withdrawal.
For example , if the item
