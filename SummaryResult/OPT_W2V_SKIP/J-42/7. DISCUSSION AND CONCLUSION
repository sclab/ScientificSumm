We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few  products, but reflects well the general tendency of  recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.
In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.
Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.
