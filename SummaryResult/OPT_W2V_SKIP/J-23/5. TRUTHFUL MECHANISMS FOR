We show how to construct a bid vector (be)e∈S that satisfies conditions (1) and (2) such that b(S) ≥ c(V \ S); clearly, this implies NTUmax(c, S) ≥ c(V \ S).
It is not hard to see that NTUmin(x) ≤ k: the cheapest vertex cover contains the all-0 part of each block, and we can satisfy  conditions (1)-(3) by letting one of the vertices in the all-0 part of each block to bid 1, while all other the vertices in the cheapest set bid 0.
As b satisfies conditions ( 1 ) - ( 3
