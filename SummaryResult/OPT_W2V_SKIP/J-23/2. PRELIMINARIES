Given a monotone allocation rule A and a bid vector b, the threshold bid te of an agent e âˆˆ A(b) is the highest bid of this agent that still wins the auction, given that the bids of other participants remain the same.
For set system auctions, this simply means picking a cheapest feasible set, paying each agent in the selected set his threshold bid, and paying 0 to all other agents.
A set system is a pair ( E , F ) , where E is the ground set , |E| = n , and F is a
