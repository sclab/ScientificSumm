While our main result about vertex cover auctions (Theorem 4) is with respect to NTUmin = Î½, we make use of the new definitions by first comparing the payment of our mechanism to a weaker bound NTUmax, and then  bootstrapping from this result to obtain the desired bound.
Based on this new definition, the authors  construct new mechanisms for the shortest path problem and show that the overpayment of these mechanisms is within a constant factor of optimal.
This means that the solution quality of our auction is with a factor of 2 of optimal and the frugality ratio is within
