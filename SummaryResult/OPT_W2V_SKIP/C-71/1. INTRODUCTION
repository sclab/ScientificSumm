This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to  select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the  surveillance work of the network area.
An algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which  redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.
We show that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the  network.
We also introduce another greedy solution called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm ( ICQA ) for this problem ,
