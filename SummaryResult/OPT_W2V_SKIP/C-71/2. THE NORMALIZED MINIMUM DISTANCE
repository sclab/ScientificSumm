In resource-sharing evaluation, the Global Fairness Index (GFI) is often employed to measure how even the resource distributes among these points [8], when xi represents the amount of resource that belong to point i.
Î¹ is a very interesting value of a set of points.
It is exciting to see that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi diagram [ 2 ] formed by these nodes ( A Vonoroi diagram formed by a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node
