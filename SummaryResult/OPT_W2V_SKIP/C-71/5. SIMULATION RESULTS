5.1 Number of Groups Formed by MIND and ICQA We set the total in-network node number to different values and let the networks perform MIND and ICQA.
We compare how many events happen at the locations where the quality is less than the requirement s = 0.6 when each resulting group is conducting surveillance work (We call the  number of such events the failure number of group).
