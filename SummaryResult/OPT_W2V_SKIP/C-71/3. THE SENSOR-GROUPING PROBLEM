Based on this notion, to be more reasonable, researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements: Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes: For a point with physical location L, the point is considered covered by the collaboration of i sensors (denoted by k1, ..., ki) if and only if the following two equations holds [7][10][12].
This issue is usually formulated as how to ensure that an event signal omitted in an arbitrary point in the network area can be  detected by sensor nodes.
We assume that a sensor node can only
