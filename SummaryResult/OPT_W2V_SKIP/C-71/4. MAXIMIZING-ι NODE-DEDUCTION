When a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage quality if its sensing area, except what overlaps the network margin, cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are grouped into the same group as itself, the algorithm stops.
â€¢ The deletion of the node will not result in uncovered-points inside the sensing area of i.
Under the constraint that the coverage quality of its sensing area should be ensured, node i deletes nodes in this sub-network one by one.
Then it hands over the above procedure to an unfinished group sensing neighbors
