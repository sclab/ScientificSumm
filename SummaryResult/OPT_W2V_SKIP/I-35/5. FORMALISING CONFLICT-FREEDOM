A transition is enabled in a CPN if and only if all the 2 A multi-set (or bag) is an extension to the notion of set, allowing the possibility of multiple appearances of the same element.
In accordance with Petri nets, the states of a CPN are represented by means of places.
In order to answer this question, we first translate the snapshot of the normative structure to the corresponding CPN and then execute the finite occurence sequence of markings and steps, verifying the conflict-freedom of each marking as we go along.
We make use of the reachability set R
