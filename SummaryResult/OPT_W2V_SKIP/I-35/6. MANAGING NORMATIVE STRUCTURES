In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have  annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.
It adds a given norm N to an existing , conflictfree normative state Δ , obtaining a resulting new normative state Δ which is conflict-free , that
