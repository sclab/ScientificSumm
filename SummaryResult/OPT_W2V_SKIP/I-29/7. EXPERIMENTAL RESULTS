These classes,  summarized in Table 1, were designed to evaluate key aspects of a set of Coordinators distributed scheduling agents, such as their ability to handle unexpected execution results, chains of nle"s involving multiple agents, and effective scheduling of new activities that arise unexpectedly at some point  during the problem run.
These results are particularly notable given that each agent"s STN-based scheduler does very little reasoning over the success probability of the  activity sequences it selects to execute.
Only simple tactics were adopted to explicitly address such uncertainty , such as the use of expected durations
