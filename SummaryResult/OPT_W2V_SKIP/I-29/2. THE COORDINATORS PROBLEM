a may also inherit these constraints from ancestor tasks at any higher level in the task structure, and its effective execution window will be defined by the tightest of these constraints.
Methods appear at the leaf level of C TAEMS task structures and are those that are directly executable in the world.
Each task has an associated quality value which accrues if it is successfully executed within its constraints, and the overall goal is to maximize the quality obtained during execution.
As execution proceeds , agents must react to unexpected results ( e.g. , task delays , failures ) and
