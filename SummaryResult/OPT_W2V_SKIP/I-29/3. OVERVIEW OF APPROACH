In its most basic form, an agent comprises four principal components - an Executor, a Scheduler, a Distributed State Manager (DSM), and an  Options Manager - all of which share a common model of the current problem and solution state that couples a  domainlevel representation of the subjective c taems task structure to an underlying STN.
The second principle is to first respond locally to exceptional events, and then, as time permits, explore  nonlocal options (i.e., options involving change by 2 or more agents) for global solution improvement.
This provides a basic hedge against temporal uncertainty and can be used to modulate
