This algorithm takes the values of ka i and kb i one at a time and generates an approximate solution to the above knapsack problem.
Since the first mover is the same for all the issues, and the agents make offers alternately, the offering agent for t = n is also the same for all the m issues.
Thus, irrespective of who makes the first move, all the m issues are settled at time t = m. THEOREM 6.
Note that the subscript m is used to indicate the fact that this difference depends on m. We now describe the protocol for
