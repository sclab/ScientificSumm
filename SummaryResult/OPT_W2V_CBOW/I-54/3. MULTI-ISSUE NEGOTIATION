Hence the time complexity of finding the approximate equilibrium offer for the first time period is O(nm/ 2 ).
We first obtain the strategies for the last time period t = n. It is straightforward to get these strategies; the offering agent gets a hundred percent of all the issues.
Agent a must offer a package that gives b a cumulative utility equal to what it would get from its own approximate equilibrium offer for the next time period (i.e., Ub ([¯at+1 ,¯bt+1 ], t + 1) where [¯at+1 ,¯bt+1 ] is the approximate equilibrium package for the next time period).
For the package
