For such negotiations, we first obtain the  equilibrium strategies for the case where the issues for negotiation are known a priori to the parties.
Then, we analyse their time  complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem, even in a complete information setting.
The agents have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors.
Finally, we extend the analysis to online  negotiation where different issues become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
In order to overcome this computational complexity , we then present
