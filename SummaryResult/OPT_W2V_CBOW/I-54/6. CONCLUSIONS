Specifically, we first showed that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem even in a complete information  setting.
Finally, we extended the analysis to online negotiation where the issues  become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about the features of these issues.
Apart from this, we treated the number of issues as being common knowledge to the agents.
In future, it will be interesting to treat the number of issues as uncertain. 
Thus , the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate the issues between themselves so as to maximize their individual
