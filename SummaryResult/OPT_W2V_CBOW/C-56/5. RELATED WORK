In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.
The previously referred architectures and others that  enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.
The grid architectures generally have services that  manage computing resources and distribute the execution of  independent tasks on available ones.
There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing , aiming to provide interfaces , protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for
