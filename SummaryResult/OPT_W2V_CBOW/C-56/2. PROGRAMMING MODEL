The whole computation is made by a process, which uses a parallel controller to start and dispatch several concurrent activities of the same type, in order to find prime numbers.
This process contains a PARFOR controller aiming to  execute a determined number of parallel activities.
Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process;  subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a  parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and  subprocesses.
In such case , the controller divides the whole range of numbers in subranges of the
