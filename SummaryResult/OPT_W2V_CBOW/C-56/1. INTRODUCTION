Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed  processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and  steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.
The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed  process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled,  structured and localized way.
Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities.
