The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.
Because of the fact that we do not use signal  strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.
Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes , it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another
