To the best of our knowledge we are the first to use this approach for static caching of posting lists. 
Although these approaches seek to improve query processing efficiency, they differ from our  current work in that they do not consider caching.
Based on the observations of Markatos, Lempel and Moran propose a new caching policy, called Probabilistic Driven Caching, by attempting to estimate the probability distribution of all possible queries submitted to a search engine [8].
Long and Suel propose a caching system structured according to three different levels [9].
Similar ideas have been used in the context of
