We provide a framework for the analysis of the trade-off between static caching of query answers and posting lists; • Static caching of terms can be more effective than  dynamic caching with, for example, LRU.
We provide algorithms based on the Knapsack problem for  selecting the posting lists to put in a static cache, and we show improvements over previous work, achieving a hit ratio over 90%; • Changes of the query distribution over time have little impact on static caching.
The primary use of a cache memory is to speedup computation by exploiting frequently or recently used data ,
