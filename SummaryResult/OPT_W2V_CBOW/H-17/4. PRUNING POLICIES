This suggests the algorithm in Figure 10 that computes the top-k result A from IP together with the correctness indicator function C. In the algorithm, the correctness indicator function C is set to one only if all documents in the top-k result A appear in all inverted lists I(ti) with ti âˆˆ q, so we know their exact score.
Since the exact form of tr ( D , ti ) and tr ( D , q ) differs depending on the search engine , we will not restrict to any particular form ; instead , in order to make
