2 The above example shows that the cost of the two-tier  architecture depends on two important parameters: the size of the p-index and the fraction of the queries that can be handled by the 1st tier index alone.
Intuitively, there exists a clear tradeoff between the size of IP and the fraction of queries that IP can handle: When IP is large and has more information, it will be able to handle more queries, but the cost for maintaining and looking up IP will be higher.
To find out the answer , we first compute the number of machines needed
