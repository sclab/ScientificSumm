More specifically, we apply the algorithm HS of Figure 6 to our full index IF and create a keyword-pruned p-index IP of size s. For the construction of our keyword-pruned p-index we used the query frequencies observed during the first 10 days of our data set.
Therefore, in our next experiment we will measure the fraction of the results coming from an p-index that are contained within the results of the full index.
For example, approximately 73% of the queries can be answered using 30% of the original index.
From the figure , we can see that the optimal index
