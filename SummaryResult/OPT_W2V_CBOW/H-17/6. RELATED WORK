The works in [1, 5, 7, 20, 27] are the most related to ours, as they describe pruning techniques based on the idea of keeping the  postings that contribute the most in the final ranking.
The pruning algorithms that we have presented in this paper are independent of the partitioning scheme used.
Similarly, there are a number of works that measure the quality of the documents,  typically as captured through link-based analysis [17, 28, 26].
This thread of work is also orthogonal to ours because a caching scheme may operate on top of our p-index in order to minimize the
