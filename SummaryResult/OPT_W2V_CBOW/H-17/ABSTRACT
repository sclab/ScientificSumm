In order to cope with the vast amounts of query loads, search engines prune their index to keep documents that are likely to be returned as top results, and use this pruned index to compute the first batches of results.
While this approach can improve performance by reducing the size of the index , if we compute the top results only from the pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in the result quality : if a document should be in the top results but was not included in the pruned index , it will be placed behind the
