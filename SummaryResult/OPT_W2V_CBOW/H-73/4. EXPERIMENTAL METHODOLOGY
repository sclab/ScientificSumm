However, two weakness of this testbed are: i) Each database contains only a small amount of document (259 documents by average for WT2g) [4]; and ii) The contents of WT2g or WT10g are arbitrarily crawled from the Web.
Three testbeds in [21] with skewed database size distributions and different types of relevant document distributions were also used to give more thorough simulation for real environments.
Trec123-AP-WSJ-60col (relevant): The 24 Associated Press collections and the 16 Wall Street Journal collections in the trec123-100col-bysource testbed were collapsed into two large databases APall and WSJall.
