As prior research on different datasets has shown the CORI algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [1,17,18], we use it as a baseline algorithm in this work.
First, the DTF is a framework designed specifically for document retrieval, but our new model integrates two distinct applications with different requirements (database recommendation and distributed document retrieval) into the same unified framework.
The first problem of distributed information retrieval is resource representation.
Thus , in uncooperative environments , one common choice is query-based sampling , which randomly generates and sends queries to individual search engines and
