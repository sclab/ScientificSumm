However, in order to calculate the probabilities of relevance, we need to estimate centralized document scores for all documents across the databases instead of only the sampled documents.
It was pointed out before that the SSL algorithm maps the database-specific scores into the centralized document scores and builds the final ranked list accordingly, which is consistent with all our selection procedures where documents with higher probabilities of relevance (thus higher centralized document scores) are selected. 
The complete lists of probabilities of relevance are inferred from all the available information specifically sR , which stands for the resource descriptions acquired by
