DATABASE RECOMMENDATION All four testbeds described in Section 4 were used in the experiments to evaluate the resource selection effectiveness of the database recommendation system.
It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ReDDE and UUM/HR algorithms are more effective (on the representative, relevant and nonrelevant testbeds) or as good as (on the Trec123-100Col testbed) the CORI resource selection algorithm.
The database size statistics were estimated by the sample-resample method [21].
Let B denote a baseline ranking, which is often the RBR (relevance based ranking), and E as a ranking provided by a resource selection algorithm.
And let Bi
