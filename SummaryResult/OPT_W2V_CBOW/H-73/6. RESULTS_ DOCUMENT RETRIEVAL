On the Trec123-100Col testbed, the document retrieval effectiveness of the CORI selection algorithm is roughly the same or a little bit better than the ReDDE algorithm but both of them are worse than the other three algorithms (Tables 3 and 4).
One main difference between the UUM/HR algorithm and the ReDDE algorithm was pointed out before : The UUM/HR uses training data and linear interpolation to estimate the centralized document score curves , while the ReDDE algorithm [ 21 ] uses a heuristic method , assumes the centralized document score curves are step functions and makes no distinction among the
