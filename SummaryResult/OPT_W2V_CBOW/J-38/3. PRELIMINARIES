A solution concept assigns to each  coalitional game a set of reasonable outcomes.
(Shapley Value) Given a description of the coalitional game and an agent i, compute the Shapley value of agent i.
A group of agents in a game is known as a coalition, and the entire set of agents is known as the grand coalition.
An outcome x ∈ R|N| is in the core of the game N , v if for all S ⊆ N , i∈S xi ≥ v ( S ) Note that the core of a game may be empty , i.e. , there
