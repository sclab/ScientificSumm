174 We will assume for now that the aggregate value  function is a polynomial over the attributes with non-negative coefficients.
Computing the Shapley value of a MACG N, M, A, a, w , when w can be an arbitrary polynomial of the aggregates a, is #P-hard, even when the Shapley value of each aggregator can be efficiently computed.
For each aggregator aj in a MACG, there is an associated oracle that answers the Shapley value of the game of attribute j.
If we do not place a limit on the degree of the polynomial , and the game N , v
