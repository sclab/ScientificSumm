The model of coalitional games with attributes has been considered in the works of Shehory and Kraus.
In this paper, we stay within the boundary of games that admits efficient  algorithm for determining the value of coalitions.
Our work is also related to the study of cooperative games with committee control [4].
The key difference in our work is the unrestricted aggregation of subgames: the aggregation could be via a polynomial function of the attributes, or even by treating the subgames as input to another computational problem such as a min-cost flow problem.
In these games , there is usually
