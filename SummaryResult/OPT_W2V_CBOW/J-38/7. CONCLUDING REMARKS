Representation results regarding efficiency of updates, and algorithmic results regarding how to compute the different solution concepts from updates, will both be very interesting.
An important direction to explore in the future is the question of efficiency in updating a game, and how to  evaluate the solution concepts without starting from scratch.
Our work on approximating the Shapley value when the aggregate value function is a non-linear function of the  attributes suggests more work to be done there as well.
Its space requirement compares favorably with other representations discussed in the literature , and hence it serves well as a
