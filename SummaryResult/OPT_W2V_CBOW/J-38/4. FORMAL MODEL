We can simply take the set of attributes as equal to the set of agents, i.e., M = N, an identity matrix for A, aggregators of sums, and the  aggregate value function w to be v. 172 4.2 An Example Let us illustrate how MACG can be used to represent a game with a simple example.
4.1 Multi-Attribute Coalitional Games A multi-attribute coalitional game (MACG) consists of two parts: a description of the attributes of the agents, which we termed an attribute model, and a function that assigns values to combination of attributes.
When the attribute matrix is clear from the
