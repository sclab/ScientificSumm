( Monotonicity lemma) For any technology (t, c), in both the agency and the non-strategic cases, the 9 This implies that there are no two sets with the same  success probability in the orbit.
In an OOA technology which is a  disjunction of the same anonymous paths (with the same  number of agents, Î³ and c, but over disjoint inputs), for any value v the optimal contract is constructed from some  number of fully-contracted paths.
Observe that in the non-strategic case the k-orbit of any technology with identical cost c is of size at most 1 ( as all sets of
