1.3 Our Results 1 One could think of a different model in which the agents have intrinsic utility from the outcome and payments may not be needed, as in [10, 11].
When the dependencies between the different subtasks are complex, we believe that  combinatorial agency models can offer a foundation for the design of contracts with appropriate incentives.
In order to focus on the main issues, the rest of the paper deals with the basic binary case: each agent has only two possible actions exert effort and shirk and there are only two possible outcomes success and failure.
The solution
