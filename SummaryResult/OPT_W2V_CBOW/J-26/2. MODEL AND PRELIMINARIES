Thus we will assume a  monotone Boolean function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} which denotes 21 whether the project succeeds as a function of the success of the n agents" tasks (and is not determined by any set of n−1 agents).
We call the set of agents S∗ that the principal contracts with in a∗ (S∗ = {i|a∗ i = 1}) an optimal contract for the principal at value v. We sometimes abuse notation and denote t(S) instead of t(a), when S is exactly the set of agents that exert effort in a ∈ A.
The contract
