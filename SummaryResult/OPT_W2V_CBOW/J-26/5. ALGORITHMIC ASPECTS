Given as input a black box for a success function t (when the costs are identical), and a value v, the number of queries that is needed, in the worst case, to find the optimal contract is exponential in n. Proof.
Once we have the orbit, it is clear that an optimal contract for any given value v can be calculated.
A more interesting question is whether if given the function t as a black box , we can compute the optimal contract in time that is polynomial in n. We can show that , in general this is not
