It turns out that the price of unaccountability here is 19/13, and is achieved at v = 52/9, which is exactly the transition point from 0 to 1 contracted agents in the agency case.
For any anonymous technology that has a  single transition in both the agency and the non-strategic cases, the POU is given by: POU = 1 + tn−1 t0 − tn−1 tn and it is obtained at the transition point of the agency case.
Thus, there exists a region in which the optimal numbers of contracted agents in the agency and the non-strategic cases are 0 and n, respectively.
