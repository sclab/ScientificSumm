time(d) means the publication time of story d. If the score exceeds the thresholdθ new, then there exists a sufficiently similar document, thus d is a old story, otherwise, there is no sufficiently similar previous document, thus d is an new story.
In incremental TF-IDF model , document frequencies are updated dynamically in each time step t : 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) t t D tdf w df w df w−= + ( 1 ) where Dt represents news story set received in time t , and dfDt ( w ) means the number of documents
