System-3: this system is the same as system-1 except that it uses the new detection procedure which is based on indexing-tree.
System-4: implemented based on the approach presented in section 5.1, i.e., terms are reweighted according to the distance between term distributions in a cluster and all stories.
Since no heldout data set for fine-tuning the threshold Î¸ new was available for experiments on TDT2, we only report minimum normalized costs for our systems in table 3.
7.2 Parameter selection for indexing-tree detection Figure 3 shows the minimum normalized costs obtained by system-3 on TDT3 using different parameters.
