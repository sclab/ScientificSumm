The previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations  sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A.
Let A, F, R, , Def be a negotiating agent such that A = AO and is an acyclic relation.
We now study acyclic preference relations that are defined formally as follows.
, an ∈ A , with n > 1 , such that ( ai , ai+1 ) ∈ R and ( an , a1 ) ∈ R , with 1 ≤ i
