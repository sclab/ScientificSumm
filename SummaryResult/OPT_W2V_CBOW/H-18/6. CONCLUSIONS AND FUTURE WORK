Moreover, we also showed that doing  segmentation among multiple documents can improve the  performance tremendously.
More previous methods should be compared with.
Our results also illustrated that  using weighted mutual information can utilize the information of multiple documents to reach a better performance.
Our approach outperforms all the previous methods on  singledocument cases.
We proposed a novel method for multi-document topic segmentation and alignment based on weighted mutual  information, which can also handle single-document cases.
We only tested our method on limited data sets.
Moreover , natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be used to find the optimal
