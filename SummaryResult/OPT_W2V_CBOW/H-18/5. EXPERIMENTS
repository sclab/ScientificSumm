Table 6 illustrates the experiment results for the case of 20 partitions (each has five document samples) of the training set and topic segmentation and alignment using MIk with different numbers of term clusters k. Notice that when the number of term clusters increases, the error rate becomes smaller.
For this data set of  singledocument segmentation, since it is just a synthetic set, which is just a concatenation of several segments about different topics, it is reasonable that approaches simply based on term frequency have a good performance.
Generally , we can only expect a better performance when the number
