To compute C(I \ i), we iterate over all the possible midrange  tuples and use the corresponding forward and backward tables to compute the locally optimal solution using the above scheme.
The subscript reminds us that the agent is midrange.9 In building these tables, we use the same scaling factor as  before; namely, the cost of a tuple tj i is scaled as follows: scost(tj i ) = ncost(tj i ) Îµcost(A) where cost(A) is the upper bound on C(I), given by our  2approximation scheme.
The most expensive step in the algorithm is computation of C ( I
