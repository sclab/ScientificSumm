We present an approximately-efficient and  approximatelystrategyproof auction mechanism for a single-good multi-unit allocation problem.
First, we develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the multi-unit allocation problem, which computes a (1 +  )approximation in worst-case time T = O(n3 / ), given n bids each with a constant number of pieces.
Second, we embed this approximation scheme within a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and compute payments to n agents for an  asymptotic cost of O(T log n).
The maximal possible gain from manipulation to a bidder in the combined scheme is bounded by / ( 1+ ) V , where V is the
