We now show that the value V ( , j) plus cost(tj ) is a 2-approximation of the original generalized knapsack problem.
It is worth noting, that unlike the 2-approximation scheme for iKnapsack( , j), the value computed with this FPTAS includes the cost to acquire uj l units from l. The following lemma shows that we achieve a (1+Îµ)-approximation.
We say that the size of an anchor tj i is uj i , 8 In fact , because of the one per list constraint , the generalized problem is closer in spirit to the multiple choice knapsack problem [ 9 ]
