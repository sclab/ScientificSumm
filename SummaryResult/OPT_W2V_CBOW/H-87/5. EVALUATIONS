Table 4 summarizes the results in TDT5SU; adaptive LR was the winner in this case, with relevance feedback on 0.05% of the test documents improving the utility by 20.9% over the results of PRF Rocchio.
Another interesting observation in these results is that the performance of LR did not improve when using a Rocchio prototype as the mean in the prior; instead, the performance decreased in some cases.
We found TF-IDF most effective for both Rocchio and LR, and used this setting in all our experiments.
The difficulty comes from the ad-hoc ( non-probabilistic ) scores generated by the Rocchio
