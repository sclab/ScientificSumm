For evaluating the performance of a system, Ctrk is computed for each topic first and then the resulting scores are averaged for a single measure (the topic-weighted Ctrk).
For example, both TDT5SU and T11SU are positively correlated to the values of A and D, and negatively correlated to the values of B and C; the only difference between them is in their penalty ratios for misses vs. false alarms, i.e., 10:1 in TDT5SU and 2:1 in T11SU.
Our objective is to maximize the former or to minimize the latter on test documents.
Using TDT3 as an example , the true
