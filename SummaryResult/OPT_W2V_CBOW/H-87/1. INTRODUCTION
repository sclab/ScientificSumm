These conditions make adaptive filtering a difficult task in statistical learning (online classification), for the following reasons: 1) it is difficult to learn accurate models for prediction based on extremely sparse training data; 2) it is not obvious how to correct the sampling bias (i.e., relevance feedback on system-accepted documents only) during the adaptation process; 3) it is not well understood how to effectively tune parameters in AF methods using cross-corpus validation where the validation and evaluation topics do not overlap, and the documents may be from different sources or different epochs.
Stimulated by those findings , we decided to
