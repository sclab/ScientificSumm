Our main conclusions from this study are the following: • Parameter optimization in AF is an open challenge but has not been thoroughly studied in the past.
We presented a cross-benchmark evaluation of incremental Rocchio and incremental LR in adaptive filtering, focusing on their robustness in terms of performance consistency with respect to cross-corpus parameter optimization.
For future research we want to study explicit modeling of the temporal trends in topic distributions and content drifting.
• We found LR more robust than Rocchio ; it had the best results ( in T11SU ) ever reported on TDT5 , TREC10 and
