Relevance feedback on a small portion (0.05~0.2%) of the TDT5 test documents yielded significant performance improvements, measuring up to a 54% reduction in Ctrk and a 20.9% increase in T11SU (with Î²=0.1), compared to the results of the top-performing system in TDT2004 without relevance feedback information.
Using systematic cross-corpus parameter optimization with both methods, we obtained the best results ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11.
Using four corpora from the Topic Detection and Tracking ( TDT ) forum and the Text Retrieval Conferences ( TREC ) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity levels , and
