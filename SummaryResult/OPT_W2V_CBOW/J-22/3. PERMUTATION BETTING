The auctioneer in a subset betting market faces a  nontrivial matching problem, that is to determine which orders to accept among all submitted orders i ∈ O.
The edge labels in the figure are the prices be; both the optimal divisible and indivisible solution in this case accept all orders in full, xe = 1. 
Assuming qe = 1 for all e , this is a cycle C with a total of |C| edges such that the worst-case profit for the auctioneer is e∈C be − ( |C| − 1 ) ≥ 0 , since in the worst-case state the auctioneer
