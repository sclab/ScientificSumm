It takes polynomial time to find a cycle in an order graph G(V, E) that has the highest worst-case profit, that is max C∈C e∈C be − (|C| − 1) , where C is the set of all cycles in G. Proof.
By Lemma 3, the maximum worst-case profit which is the optimum to the mixed integer programming problem (6), is k(G) − |E∗ |, where |E∗ | is the number of accepted edges.
Consider the graph of accepted orders for optimal matching , G∗ ( V ∗ , E∗ ) , which consists of the optimal subset of edges E∗
