For subset betting, we show that the  auctioneer problem can be solved in polynomial time if orders are divisible.
Subset betting allows traders to bet either that a candidate will end up ranked among some subset of positions in the final ordering, for example, horse A will finish in positions 4, 9, or 13-21, or that a position will be taken by some  subset of candidates, for example horse A, B, or D will finish in position 2.
We propose two expressive betting languages that seem natural for bidders , and examine the computational complexity of the auctioneer problem in
