Interesting open questions for our permutation betting  include the computational complexity of optimal indivisible matching for subset betting and the necessary condition for the existence of a match in pair betting markets.
While it is  unnatural and intractable to allow traders to bet directly on the n!
We prove that the optimal matching problem for the auctioneer is NP-hard for pair betting with both indivisible and divisible orders via reductions to the minimum feedback arc set problem.
We consider a permutation betting scenario, where traders wager on the final ordering of n candidates.
We find that in a subset betting
