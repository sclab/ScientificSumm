At starting node related to the first concept, the similarity value is constant and equal to one.
Therefore, we estimate the similarity of each hypothesis inside the most specific set S and then take the average of the  similarities.
For example, the cardinality of the first attribute is two and the others is equal to one for the given hypothesis such as {Light, Moderate, (Red, White)}.
Otherwise, we compute the common parent of the two nodes and the distance of each concept to the common parent without considering the sibling (lines 5-7).
Similarity can be estimated with a similarity metric
