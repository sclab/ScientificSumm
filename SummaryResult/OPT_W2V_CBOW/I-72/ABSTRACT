In contrast, this work develops an  approach through which the parties can negotiate the content of a  service.
We further develop a metric for measuring semantic similarity between services and compare the performance of our approach using different  similarity metrics.
Accordingly, we propose an architecture in which both consumers and producers use a shared ontology to negotiate a service.
Multiagent negotiation approaches typically assume that the parties agree on service content and focus on finding a consensus on service price.
