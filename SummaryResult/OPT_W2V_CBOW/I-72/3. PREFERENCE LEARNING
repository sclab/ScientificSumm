In this process, at each time one attribute value of negative sample is applied to the hypothesis in the general set.
The second set is the most specific set S. S contains only hypotheses that are known to identify the concept that is being learned.
For instance, if the example continues with a negative sample (Full, Strong, Red), we can specialize the previous rule such as {(?-Full), ?, (?-Red)}.
This stems from the possibility of using this rule in the  generation of other hypotheses.
Each attribute of the hypothesis has two parts : inclusive list , which holds the list of
