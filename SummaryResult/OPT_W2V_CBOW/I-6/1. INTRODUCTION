A simple way of distinguishing between compliant and expected behaviour with respect to an ACL  specification that enables reasoning about the potential  behaviour of agents purely from an ACL semantics  perspective.
Finally, none of the existing approaches allows the ACL to specify how to respond to a violation of its semantics by individual agents.
These elements taken together result in a FSM-like view of ACL specifications where each individual state provides a complete ACL semantics and state transitions are triggered by observed agent behaviour in order to ( 1 ) reflect future expectations based on previous interaction experience and (
