whether it is a reward or punishment), the other the degree of adaptation (reputation-based mechanisms, for example, need not realistically reflect the behaviour of the culprit, but may instead utilise immediate (exaggerated) stigmatisation of agents as a deterrent).
Compliance/deviance realisability: It must be  possible for agents in principle to comply with normative commitments or deviate from them in principle: ∃r ∈ R(Env, A) .expected(CS(r)) = ∅∧ compliant(CS(r)) = ∅ While not absolutely essential, these constitute desiderata for the design of DS-ACLs as they add to the simplicity and clarity of a given semantics specification.
