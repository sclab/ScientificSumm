For v, w ∈ D and b, c ∈ A, we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Svw .
Let b, c ∈ A and let −→a , −→a ∈ Pbc.
We say that −→a is admissible if C(−→a ) is nonempty.
For −→u ∈ C(−→a ) we define ∆−→a (−→u ) = |−→a |−1 X i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)).
D-sequence ( v , w , x , y , z ) is compatible with both path ( a , b , c , e ) and path
