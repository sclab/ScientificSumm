Our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and an n × n matrix M satisfying the following properties: (1) M is non-singular.
, en}, which is the set of vectors in Rn with nonnegative coordinates that sum to 1.
For outcomes λ, µ ∈ A, δλµ +δµλ = λT M(λ−µ)+µT M(µ−λ) = (λ−µ)T M(λ−µ), 292 which is nonnegative since M is positive semidefinite.
x and the open line segment zx is assigned outcome a , y and the open line segment xy is assigned outcome b , and z and the open line segment yz
