Now we are ready for the zero three-cycle property: Lemma 17. ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0 for all a, b, c ∈ A.
First, we prove for the case where v is between u and w. From lemma 8, there are compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCuv ab , (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
Lemma 15. ρbc + ρcb = 0 for all b, c ∈ A.
For ( a , b , c ) ∈ S , the restriction of f to the compact set Rabc attains a minimum m ( a , b , c ) at some point ( u ,
