Clearly we can apply the above conclusion to v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc and get a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCv w bc with −→a simple and δ(−→a ) ≤ v (b) − v (c).
To prove this, we first fix v ∈ Db and w ∈ Dc and show (lemma 11) that every straight (b, c)-path compatible with some linear (v, w)-sequence has the same δ-weight ρbc(v, w).
For a path −→a , (v, w) is compatible with −→a if there is a linear (v, w)-sequence compatible with −→a .
