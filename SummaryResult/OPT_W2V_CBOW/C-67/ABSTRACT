Therefore, we would like to share valuable information we learned from our implementation of an Xgrid environment with our colleagues.
In order to harness the lost processing time for tasks such as video rendering, we are testing Xgrid, a suite of Mac OS X applications recently developed by Apple for parallel and distributed high-performance computing.
As visual artists cross from paint on canvas to creating in the digital realm, the demand for a  highperformance computing environment grows.
In our report , we will address issues such as assessing the needs for grid computing , potential applications , management tools ,
