In this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.
For  example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to  optimize some cut value (e.g.
A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a  meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.
However , unlike spectral clustering , which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole
