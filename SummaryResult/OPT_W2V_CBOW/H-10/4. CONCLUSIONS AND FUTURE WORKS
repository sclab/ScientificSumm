In this paper, we derived a new clustering algorithm called clustering with local and global regularization.
Our method preserves the merit of local learning algorithms and spectral clustering.
Our experiments show that the proposed  algorithm outperforms most of the state of the art algorithms on many benchmark datasets.
In the future, we will focus on the parameter selection and acceleration issues of the CLGR algorithm.
