We study the improvements of our  incremental gossip protocols over standard gossiping in two  dimensions: execution time and network overhead.
In each run of the simulation, we induce a change in the measured signal at one or more devices.
Finally, in order to isolate the effect of protocol  operation on performance, we do not model the complexities of the wireless channel in our simulations.
Although each protocol uses the same number of random walks, IRWP uses fewer network resources than random walk because it takes less time to converge.
As more signal changes are introduced into the system , gossip
