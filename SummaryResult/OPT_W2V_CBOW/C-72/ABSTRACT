Wireless radios of the future will likely be frequency-agile, that is, supporting opportunistic and adaptive use of the RF spectrum.
We focus on the problem of sharing RF spectrum data among a collection of wireless devices.
The inherent requirements of such data and the time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this problem both interesting and technically challenging.
We outline an initial solution incorporating these ideas and also show how our approach reduces network overhead by up to a  factor of 2.4 and results in up to 2.7 times faster information convergence than alternative approaches.
Such radios must coordinate
