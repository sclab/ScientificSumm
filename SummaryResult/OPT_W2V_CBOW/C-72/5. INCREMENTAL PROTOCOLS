With the original implementation of FM, the aggregate would need to be discarded and a new one recomputed every time an update occurred.
A SUM aggregate is computed similar to COUNT (explained in Section 4.1), except that each node performs s coin toss experiments, where s is the locally measured signal level.
The allocation of walks to updates is discussed in more detail in [3], where the authors show that the number of walks has an almost negligible impact on network overhead.
