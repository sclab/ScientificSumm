As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].
However, due to the need of a fixed AP infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.
Although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these  techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static.
As a result , simple local sensing approaches have
