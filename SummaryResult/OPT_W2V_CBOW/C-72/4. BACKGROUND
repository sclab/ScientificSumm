This  aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the  network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e.
More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].
The  intuition is that as the number of nodes doing coin toss  experiments increases, the probability of a more significant bit being set in one of the nodes" bit vectors increases.
In each time-step , each designated node sends its data to a random neighbor , which becomes designated for the subsequent timestep
