However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.
Contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of FM bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.
As a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.
Suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands , and each signal can have up to
