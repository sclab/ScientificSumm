The problem with this and similar centralized  systems is the need of the one or handful of microphone arrays to be in line-of-sight of the shooter.
Researchers at BBN have developed the Bullet Ears system [3] which has the capability to be installed in a fixed position or worn by soldiers.
Joint time-frequency (JTF) spectrograms are used to analyze the typical separation of the shockwave and  muzzle blast transients in both time and frequency.
Fansler"s work gives a good idea of the ideal muzzle blast pressure wave without contamination from echoes or propagation effects [4].
Note that the
