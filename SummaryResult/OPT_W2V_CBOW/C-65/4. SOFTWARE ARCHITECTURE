This  architecture enabled us to deploy the same set of sensors in a centralized scenario, where the ad-hoc mote network (using the I2 C interface) collected and forwarded the results to a base station or to build a decentralized system where the local PDAs execute the sensor fusion on the data obtained through the Bluetooth interface (and optionally from other sensors through the mote interface).
The time conversion and synchronization between the sensor network and the board is done by the mote by periodically requesting the capture of the current timer value through a dedicated GPIO line and reading the
