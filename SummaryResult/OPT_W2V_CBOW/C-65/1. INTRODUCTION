As it is primarily the soldiers that the system protects, a natural extension is to mount the sensors on the soldiers themselves.
The truly unique  characteristic of the system is that it works in such reverberant environments as cluttered urban terrain and that it can  resolve multiple simultaneous shots at the same time.
113 To move from a static sensor network-based solution to a highly mobile one presents significant challenges.
The acoustic sensors measure the Time of Arrival ( ToA ) of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves , pressure waves induced by the supersonic projectile , send the data to
