The orientation of the microphone array at the time of detection is provided by a 3-axis digital compass.
The  wavefront has a conical shape, the angle of which depends on the Mach number, the speed of the bullet relative to the speed of sound.
A hybrid sensor fusion algorithm then estimates the trajectory, the range, the caliber and the weapon type based on all available observations.
However , the sensorboards are also connected to COTS MICAz motes and they share their AoA and ToA measurements , as well as their own location and orientation , with each other using a
