Experiments with a previous  generation sensor board indicated that this could provide a 10x increase in battery life.
Second, the performance of the system when used in  standalone mode, that is, when single sensors alone provided localization, was also very good.
We believe that with the lessons learned in the test, a consecutive field experiment could have showed significantly improved results especially in range estimation beyond 100 m and weapon classification for the remaining two weapons that were mistaken for each other the majority of the times during the test.
While the overall localization rate of 42 % per sensor
