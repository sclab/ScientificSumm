The heterogeneous sensor fusion algorithm can work with data from a single sensor or it can fuse ToA or Angle of Arrival (AoA) observations of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves from multiple sensors.
A sensor node consists of a  helmetmounted microphone array, a COTS MICAz mote for  internode communication and a custom sensorboard that  implements the acoustic detection and Time of Arrival (ToA)  estimation algorithms on an FPGA.
The system  estimates the trajectory, the range, the caliber and the weapon type.
A 3-axis compass provides self orientation and Bluetooth is used for communication with the soldier '' s PDA running
