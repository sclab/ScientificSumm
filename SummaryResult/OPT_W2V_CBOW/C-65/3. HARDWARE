Due to the complex voltage requirements of the FPGA, the power supply circuitry is implemented on the  sensorboard and provides power both locally and to the mote.
An RS232 port and a Bluetooth (BlueGiga WT12) wireless link with virtual UART emulation are directly available on the board and provide simple means to connect the sensor to PCs and PDAs.
Some of these nodes were mounted on military kevlar helmets with the microphones directly attached to the  surface at about 20 cm separation as shown in Figure 3(a).
The regulators-except the last one-can be turned on/off from the mote or
