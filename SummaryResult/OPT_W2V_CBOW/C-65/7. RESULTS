The  percentages are relative to the number of shots localized and not all shots, as the classification algorithm needs to know the trajectory and the range.
7.1 Single sensor performance As was shown previously, a single sensor alone is able to localize the shooter if it can determine both the muzzle blast and the shockwave AoA, that is, it needs to measure the ToA of both on at least three acoustic channels.
There are several disadvantages of the single sensor case compared to the networked system : there is no redundancy to compensate for other errors and to perform outlier
