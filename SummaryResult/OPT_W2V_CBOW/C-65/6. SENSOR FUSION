Once the trajectory is known, the speed can be calculated for each sensor based on the shockwave geometry.
This is because for a given weapon type and ammunition pair, the muzzle velocity is nearly constant.
Since it is a box and not a single point, this gives us an interval for the shot time.
It is shown below that these measurements are sufficient to compute the position of the shooter (P).
To avoid this error sensitivity problem, we consider shockwave  measurement pairs only if the direction of arrival difference is larger than a certain threshold.
Some sensors report only ToA
