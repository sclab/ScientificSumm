Although the cores are running  independently and in parallel, a crude local fusion module integrates them by shutting down those cores which missed their events after a reasonable timeout and by generating a single  detection message towards the mote.
If too much garbage is discarded in the collection phases, the core resets itself to prevent the (false) detection of the halves from completely different  periods separated by rapid oscillation or noise.
Since the muzzle blast signature closely follows the shockwave signal and because of potential automatic weapon bursts , it is extremely important to settle the audio channels and the
