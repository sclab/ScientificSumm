In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.
In this configuration , the algorithm outlined above will be slightly modified , as the audio packets will go from clients to their dedicated S-CS that will select NMax packets to send to the local M-CS , which will then select NMax packets from all its
