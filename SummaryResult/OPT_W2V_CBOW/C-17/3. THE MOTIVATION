In all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • In an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.
In this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes ‘gagging" for the users.
Moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15].
We make use of the "Loudness Number" for implementing floor control.
