This means that node i (or possibly its children) will have to combine the proofs that they receive to generate a proof of the rest of path quality.
5.1 Implementing Monitors Claim 5 should not be interpreted as a statement that each node must compute the rest of path quality locally, without input from other nodes.
This argument can be iterated along the entire path to the penultimate node before D. Since the marginal costs and qualities can be arranged to make any path the optimal path , these statements must hold for all nodes and their children , which
