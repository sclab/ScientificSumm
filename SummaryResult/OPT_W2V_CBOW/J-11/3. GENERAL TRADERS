This is one of the complementary slackness conditions to make sure the current trade is optimal for trader t. For all seller-buyer pairs (i, j) that a trader t can trade with, we have pi + qti + pj + qtj ≥ θji − θij , (1) which will make sure that qt is a feasible dual solution for the optimization problem faced by trader t. We need to have equality in (1) when trader t is trading  between i and j.
When setting up the optimization problem for a trader t above , we used pi to denote the maximum profit i can
