The new representation Z is ensured to capture both the structures of the link matrix A and the content matrix C. Once we find the optimal Z, we can apply the traditional classification or clustering methods on vectorial data Z.
The new approximating form ˜A = ZUZ puts a clear meaning that the links are between the same set of objects,  represented by features Z.
The approximating matrix ˜A = ZU shows no evidence that links are within the same set of objects.
The major problem is that , PCA ignores the fact that the rows and columns of A are indexed
