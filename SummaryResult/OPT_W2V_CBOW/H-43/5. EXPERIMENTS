Since our approach consider the link structure as well as the content information, our two methods give results a highest accuracies among these approaches.
The difference  between the results of our two methods is not significant.
We measure the results by the classification accuracy, i.e., the percentage of the number of correct classified documents in the entire data set.
For this task, the accuracies of SVM on links are worse than that of SVM on content.
