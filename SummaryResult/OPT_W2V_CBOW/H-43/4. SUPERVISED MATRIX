Once we obtain w, b, and Z, we can apply h on the vertices with unknown class labels, or apply traditional classification algorithms on Z to get the classification results. 
In the one-against-rest scheme, we assign a label vector for each class label.
(5) form a matrix H = ZW + 1b , (7) where 1 is a vector of size n, whose elements are all one, W is a c Ã— l parameter matrix, and b is a parameter vector of size c. The total loss is proportional to the sum of Eq.
Assume we know the labels { yi } for
