Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.
By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.
On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.
In our model , we connect two components through a set of shared factors , that
