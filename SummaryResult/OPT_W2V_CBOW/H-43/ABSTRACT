Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an  algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by  carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.
It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by  exploiting both the content and the link structure.
Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or
