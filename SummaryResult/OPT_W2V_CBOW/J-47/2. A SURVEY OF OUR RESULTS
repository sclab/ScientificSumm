This result is in some sense tight, since we show that any k-term XOR formula can be fully elicited by kâˆ’1  nondeterministic (i.e., when some exogenous teacher  instructs the auctioneer on how to increase the prices) ascending auctions.12 We also show that item-price ascending auctions and  iterative auctions that are limited to a polynomial number of queries (of any kind, not necessarily ascending) are  incomparable in their power: ascending auctions, with small enough increments, can elicit the preferences in cases where any polynomial number of queries cannot.
However , we also observe that these auctions , as well as
