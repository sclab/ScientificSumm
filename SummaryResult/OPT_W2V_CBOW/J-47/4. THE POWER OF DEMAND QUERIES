A value query can be simulated by mt  demand queries (where t = log L is the number of bits needed to represent a single bundle value).18 As a direct corollary we get that demand auctions can always fully elicit the bidders" valuations by simulating all possible 2m âˆ’ 1 queries and thus elicit enough information for determining the optimal allocation.
37 We will show that any bundle-price auction that uses only the XOR-language to describe bundle prices requires an exponential cost ( which includes the sum of all description lengths of prices ) to find an optimal allocation
