This is because that  ascending auctions can usually not achieve such running times (consider even the English auction on a single item).16 Note that all of our results give concrete bounds, where the  dependence on the parameters is given explicitly; we use the standard big-Oh notation just as a shorthand.
In such auctions, the queries that are sent to bidders are demand queries: the query specifies a price p(S) âˆˆ + for each bundle S. The reply of bidder i is simply the set most desired - demanded - under these prices.
It may be useful to define multi-trajectory ascending auctions
