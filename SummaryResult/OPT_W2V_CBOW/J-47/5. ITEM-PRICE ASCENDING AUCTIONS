On the other hand, we show that an XOR formula can be fully elicited by k−1 non-deterministic ascending auctions (or by k−1 deterministic ascending  auctions if the auctioneer knows the atomic bundles).22 21 A recent unpublished paper by Mishra and Parkes  extends this result, and shows that non-anonymous prices with bundle-prices are necessary in order that an ascending  auction will end up with a universal-competitive-equilibrium (that leads to VCG payments).
The idea behind the proofs is that the information that the auctioneer can get for free at the beginning of each type of auction is different.23 and non-deterministic iterative
