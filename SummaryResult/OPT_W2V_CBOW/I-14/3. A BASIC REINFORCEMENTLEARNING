Note that if we want to limit the number of downstream agents for search session sj as 5, the probability of forwarding the query to all neighboring agents should add up to 5.
Their neighbors then generate a new routing policy based on the updated observation and in turn they calculate the expected utility based on the new policies and continue this iterative process.
Instead, agent just have to determine the classification of the query properly and follow the learned policies.
The assumption here is that the set of query types is learned ahead of time and belongs to the
