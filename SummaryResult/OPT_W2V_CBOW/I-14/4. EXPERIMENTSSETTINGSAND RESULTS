However, it remains as future work to discover the  correlation between the magnitude of the performance gains and the size of the data collection and/or the extent of the  heterogeneity between the sub-collections. 
Figure 4 shows the ARSS(Average Reward per Search  Session) versus the number of incoming queries over time for the the Two-Step based Non-learning Algorithm(TSNA), and the Two-Step Learning Algorithm(TSLA) for data  collection TREC-VLC-921.
The average reward for TSLA approach , where learning algorithm is exploited , starts at the same level with the TSNA algorithm and improves the average reward over time until 2000âˆ’2500
