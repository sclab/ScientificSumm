In addition, the destination agents in our  contentrouting algorithms are multiple and the addresses are not known in the routing process.
These studies have explored fully distributed algorithms that are able, without central  coordination to disseminate knowledge about the network, to find the shortest paths robustly and efficiently in the face of changing network topologies and changing link costs.
