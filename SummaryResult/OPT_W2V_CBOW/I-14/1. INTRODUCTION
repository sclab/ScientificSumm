Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (1) a reinforcement learning based approach for agents to acquire satisfactory routing policies based on estimates of the potential contribution of their neighboring agents; (2) two strategies to speed up the learning process.
Second, the similarity-based approaches do not take into account the run-time characteristics of the P2P IR systems, including environmental parameters, bandwidth usage, and the  historical information of the past search sessions, that provide valuable information for the query routing algorithms.
The intention of the reinforcement learning is to adapt the agents '' routing decisions to the dynamic network situations and
