In these approaches, agents depend on the content similarity between incoming queries and their direct neighboring agents to direct the distributed search sessions.
Specifically, agents maintain estimates on the downstream agents" abilities to provide relevant documents for incoming queries.
Thereafter, these agents route the queries based on the learned policies and update the estimates based on the new routing policies.
Based on this information, the agents derive corresponding routing policies.
In this paper , an online reinforcement-learning based approach is developed to take advantage of the dynamic run-time characteristics of P2P IR systems as represented by information about past
