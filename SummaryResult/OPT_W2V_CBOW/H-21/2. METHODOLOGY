This number indicates how relevant the ad a is to query q, and can be used to rank ads a for a given query q.
While P(d|q) is harder to compute, we consider the underlying relevance model for ranking documents given a query.
Thus, we only need to obtain estimates of P(Cj|q) for each query q.
The search engine can then be represented by a function f = similarity ( q , d ) that quantifies the affinity between a query q and a document d. Examples of such affinity scores used in this paper are rank-the rank
