When using search results, one can either use only summaries of the results provided by 3 Since the field of query classification does not yet have  established and agreed upon benchmarks, direct comparison of results is admittedly tricky.
We attribute our observations to using a more elaborate voting scheme among the classifications of individual search results, as well as to using a more difficult set of rare queries.
For a classifier that is external to the search engine, retrieving full pages may be prohibitively costly, in which case one might prefer to use summaries to gain computational efficiency.
