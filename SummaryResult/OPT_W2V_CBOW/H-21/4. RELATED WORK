In this approach, the problem of not having a document classifier for web results is solved by using a training set available for documents with a different  taxonomy.

Studies in the field pursue different approaches for  obtaining additional information about the queries.
More recently, studies in query augmentation focused on classification of queries, assuming such classifications to be beneficial for more focused query interpretation.
