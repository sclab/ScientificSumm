Our model is based on the simple idea that autonomous learners should maintain meta-descriptions of their own learning processes (see also [3]) in order to be able to  exchange information and reason about them in a rational way (i.e.
In such systems , learners ( agents ) may not be able to integrate their datasets or learning results ( because of different data formats and representations , learning algorithms , or legal restrictions that prohibit such integration [ 11 ] ) and can not always be guaranteed to interact in a strictly cooperative fashion ( discovered knowledge and collected data
