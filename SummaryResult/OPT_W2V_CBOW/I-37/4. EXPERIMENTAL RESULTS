As can be seen from the performance plots in Figure 3 (homogeneous case) and 4 (heterogeneous case, two agents use the same method and one agent uses the other) this is clearly the case for the (unrestricted) join and filter  integration operations (m = k) in both cases.
We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data.
k-means k-medoids filtering 30-40 % 10-20 % m-filtering 20-30 % 5-15 % The overall conclusion we can draw from these initial experiments with our architecture is that since a very
