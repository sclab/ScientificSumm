Finally, more sophisticated evaluation criteria for such distributed  learning architectures have to be developed to shed some light on what the right measures of optimality for autonomously reasoning and communicating agents should be.
This framework constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt 684 The Sixth Intl.
These issues, together with a more systematic and  thorough investigation of advanced interaction and  communication mechanisms for distributed, collaborating and  competing agents will be the subject of our future work on the subject.
Secondly, we have not experimented with agents using completely different learning algorithms (e.g.
In systems composed of completely different agents the
