In the most general sense, our learning agent"s internal learning process update can hence be viewed as a function λ : ℘(L) → L × ℘(L) which takes a set of learning histories of oneself and others as inputs and computes a new learning step to be executed while updating the set of known learning process histories (e.g.
For this purpose , we will assume that learners describe their internal state in terms of sets of learning processes ( in the sense of disjunctive choice ) which we call learning process descriptions ( LPDs ) rather than
