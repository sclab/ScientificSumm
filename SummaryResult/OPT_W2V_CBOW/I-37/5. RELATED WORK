The ANIMALS system [10] was used to simulate  multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning  techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.
The MALE system [19] was a very early multiagent  learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.
[13] which is also specifically designed for a  particular learning algorithm.
As these examples show and to the best of our knowledge , there have been no previous attempts to provide a framework that can accommodate both independent and heterogeneous
