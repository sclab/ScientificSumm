â€¢ If pure strategy Nash equilibria do exist, how efficient are they (in terms of the price of anarchy, or its optimistic  counterpart) under different placement costs, network topologies, and demand distributions?
However, most such systems assume that servers cooperate with one another by following protocols optimized for overall system performance, regardless of the costs incurred by each server.
The price of anarchy bounds the worst possible behavior of a selfish system, when left completely on its own.
It has been an open question whether these caching scenarios and protocols maintain their desirable global properties ( low total social cost
