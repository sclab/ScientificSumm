Our caching game is different from all of these in that the optimization process is performed among distributed selfish servers.
Centralized algorithms for the placement of objects, web proxies, mirrors, and instrumentation servers in the Internet have been studied  extensively [18,19,23,30].
Their results are not  directly applicable to our problem, however, because we consider each server to be tied to a particular location, while in their model an agent is able to open facilities in multiple locations.
As in our work , they provide monetary incentives to mobile users for caching data items , and provide tight bounds on the
