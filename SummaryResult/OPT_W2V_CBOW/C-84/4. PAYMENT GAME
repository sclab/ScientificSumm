Having set ti to α for i in Nc means that any node in N is at least as well off lowering its threshold and replicating as bidding α to some node in Nc to make it replicate, so we may disregard the latter as a profitable strategy.
Let No be the set of nodes that replicate the object and Nc = N − No be the rest of the nodes.
vi specifies the player to whom i makes a bid , bi ≥ 0 is the value of the bid , and ti ≥ 0 denotes a threshold for payments
