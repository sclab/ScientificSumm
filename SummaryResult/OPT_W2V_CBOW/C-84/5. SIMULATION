The trends for the PoA, OPoA, and Ratio are similar to the results for the line topology, with a peak in PoA at Î± = 0.8 due to maximal undersupply.
As shown in the analysis, the simulations achieve OPoA close to one (it is not exactly one because of randomness in the simulations).
The OPoA is equal to one in the figure when the same number of replicas are placed.
We examine price of anarchy ( PoA ) , optimistic price of anarchy ( OPoA ) , and the average ratio of the costs of Nash equilibria and social optima (
