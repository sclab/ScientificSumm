We show the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria and investigate the price of anarchy, which is the relative cost of the lack of coordination.
We analyze replication of resources by server nodes that act  selfishly, using a game-theoretic approach.
With a  payment scheme the game can always implement the social optimum in the best case by giving servers incentive to replicate.
The price of anarchy can be high due to undersupply problems, but with certain network topologies it has better bounds.
We refer to this as the  selfish caching problem.
In our model , nodes incur either cost for
