We show that pure strategy Nash  equilibria exist in the game and that the price of anarchy can be O(n) in general, where n is the number of servers, due to undersupply  problems.
With specific topologies, we show that the price of anarchy can have tighter bounds.
More importantly, with payments, servers are incentivized to replicate and the optimistic price of anarchy is always one.
In this work we introduce a novel non-cooperative game model to characterize the caching problem among selfish servers without any central coordination.
Non-cooperative caching is a more realistic model than cooperative caching in the
