Another  observation we made was that the number of replicas in a Nash  equilibrium can be more than the number of replicas in the social  optimum even without payments.
Since caching one object affects the ability to cache another, there is no separability of a multi-object game into multiple single object games.
In our analyses, we assume that all nodes have the same demand.
However, nodes could have different demand depending on objects.
However , if we aggregate n − 1 nodes into one node with demand n − 1 , the price of anarchy becomes O ( 1 )
