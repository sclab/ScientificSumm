dkj < α (5) The first condition guarantees that there is a server that places the replica within distance α of each server i.
Throughout our discussion, we use C(SW ) to represent the cost of worst case Nash equilibrium, C(SO) to represent the cost of social optimum, and PoA to represent the price of anarchy, which is C(SW ) C(SO) .
In this analysis we use simply α in place of αij , since we deal with a single object and we assume placement cost is the same for all servers.
Network ( c ) shows a Nash equilibrium in
