This approach only covers 10% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system (when the exact translation of the original query is given).
By leveraging additional resources such as parallel corpora, web mining and  logbased monolingual query expansion, the final system is able to cover 42% of the relevant queries suggested by an MLQS system with precision as high as 79.6%.
Comparison of average precision (AP) on TREC 6 without and with post-translation expansion.
To further test the quality of the suggested queries, CLQS system is used as a query translation system in CLIR tasks.
