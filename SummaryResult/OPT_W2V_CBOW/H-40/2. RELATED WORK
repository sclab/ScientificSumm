Most approaches to CLIR perform a query translation followed by a monolingual IR.
As CLQS exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language.
Query logs have been successfully used for monolingual IR [8, 12, 15, 26], especially in monolingual query suggestions [12] and relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion [8, 15].
In [1], the target language query log has been exploited to help query translation in CLIR. 
CLQS is different from CLQE in that it aims to suggest
