Experiments show: (a) An effective tuning of the networks as time passes and more queries are posed to the network, even if agents maintain the models of a small percentage of their acquaintances.
The comparison to the case where no routing indices are exploited reveals the same results as in the static case, to the cost of a large number of messages.
Results computed in each experiment show the number of  querypropagation messages ( ), the number of messages for the update of indices ( ), the of the system, i.e.
In such a setting , the demand for information items is much higher
