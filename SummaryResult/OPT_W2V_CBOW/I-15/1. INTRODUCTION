The main issue in this paper concerns â€˜tuning" a network of agents, each with a specific expertise, for efficient and effective information searching and sharing, without altering the topology or imposing an overlay structure via clustering, introduction of shortcut indices, or re-wiring.
Section 3 states the problem and section 4 presents in detail the individual techniques and the overall proposed method.
However , as far as we know there is no work that demonstrates the effectiveness of a gradual tuning process in large-scale dynamic networks that studies the impact of the information gathered by agents as more and more
