This approach is based on the specification of agents as providers and needers: This is done by a plan-based  precomputation of information needs and provision abilities of agents.
However, this approach can not scale to large and dynamic networks, as it would be highly inefficient for each agent to compute and determine its potential needs and information provision abilities given its potential interaction with 100s of other agents.
Their work differs in the one reported here in the following aspects : First , it aims at optimizing communication , while the goal here is to tune the network for effective
