Unlike proxy-based architectures that have been proposed in the literature where the proxies replicate all of the game state, the communication proxies in the proposed  architecture support clients that are in proximity to it in the  physical network and maintain information about selected  portions of the game space that are relevant only to the clients that they support.
Using this architecture, we propose an authority assignment mechanism that divides the  authority for deciding the outcome of different actions/events that occur within the game between client and servers on a per action/event basis.
We present a proxy-based gaming architecture and authority
