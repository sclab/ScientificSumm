Also, since so much trust is put into the clients of our  architecture, it will be necessary to integrate into the  architecture many of the cheat detection schemes that have been proposed in the literature.
As discussed earlier, this will allow for a more efficient and responsive game in certain situations and alleviate some of the processing load from the server.
We further propose to make the proxies in our architecture more game cognizant so that cheat detection mechanisms can be built into the proxies themselves. 
Second , we proposed a mixed authority assignment mechanism that divides authority for making
