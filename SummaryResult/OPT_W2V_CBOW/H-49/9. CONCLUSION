To our knowledge, this is the first large scale examination of zero-judgment, single-retrieval  performance prediction.
Our  experiments also demonstrate the limits of the usefulness of our predictors when information from multiple runs is provided.
First, our results could affect retrieval algorithm design.
Second, when provided retrievals from other systems, our extended methods demonstrate  competitive performance with state of the art baselines.
This performance, combined with a simple implementation, makes our predictors, in particular, very  attractive.
First, when making  predictions in the absence of retrievals from other systems, our predictors demonstrate robust, strong correlations with  average precision.
We have demonstrated this
