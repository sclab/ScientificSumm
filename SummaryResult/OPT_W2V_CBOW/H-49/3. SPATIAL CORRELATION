Whereas in information retrieval, we are concerned with the score at a point in a space, in spatial data analysis, we are concerned with the value of a function at a point or location in a space.
We can treat the correlation between the retrieval we are interested in and the combined scores as a predictor of performance.
Given documents and some similarity measure, we can construct a matrix which encodes the similarity between pairs of documents.
Therefore , we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to establish a bound , ˜IM ≤ n eTWe s yTWTWy yTy And we define the
