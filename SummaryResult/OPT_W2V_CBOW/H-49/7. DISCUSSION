It is important before applying this measure to confirm that, given the semantics for some link between two retrieved items, we should expect a correlation between scores. 
We should make it clear that we have selected tasks where topical autocorrelation is appropriate.
With some exceptions, the correlation of document scores has largely been ignored.
Once computed, a system rarely compares the score of a to the score of a topically-related document b.
Our results demonstrate that this approximation is not as powerful as information from multiple retrievals.
Assuming the presence of multiple retrievals is unrealistic in this case.
For example
