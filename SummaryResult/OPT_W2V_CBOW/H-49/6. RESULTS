However, these improvements are slight compared to the performance of autocorrelation on these collections.
Therefore, we believe that the improvement in correlation is the result of  incorporating information from spatial behavior.
Ranking robustness was presented as an  improvement to Clarity for web collections (represented in our  experiments by the terabyte04 and terabyte05 collections),  shifting the τ correlation from 0.139 to 0.150 for terabyte04 and 0.171 to 0.208 for terabyte05.
In the cases where ρ(y, yµ) performs well, incorporating autocorrelation rarely results in a significant improvement in performance.
When examining the performance of linear combinations of predictors , we note
