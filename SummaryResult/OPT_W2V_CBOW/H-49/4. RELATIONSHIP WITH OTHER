The information introduced by the query, though, is retrieval-independent so that, if two  retrievals return the same set of documents, the approximate Cox-Lewis statistic will be the same regardless of the  retrieval scores.
PREDICTORS One way to predict the effectiveness of a retrieval is to look at the shared vocabulary of the top n retrieved  documents.
Here, we can consider the fusion of these retrieval as a surrogate for relevance.
Finally, in Figure 2c, we depict prediction when given retrievals from several other systems on the same query.
The conjecture is that a good retrieval will use language distinct from
