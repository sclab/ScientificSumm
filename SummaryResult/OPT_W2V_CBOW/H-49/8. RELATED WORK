The task is, given these retrievals, to predict the ranking of systems according to some performance measure.
The task here is not to test the hypothesis system A is superior to system B but to test the hypothesis retrieval A is superior to retrieval B. Autocorrelation manifests itself in many classification tasks.
The adjusted coefficient of determination is presented to measure the effectiveness of combining predictors.
We present correlations between the classic Clarity measure (DV KL), the ranking robustness measure (P), and autocorrelation (ρ(y, ˜y)) each with mean average precision in terms of Kendall"s τ.
Our task
