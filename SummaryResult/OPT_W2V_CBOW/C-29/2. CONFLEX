When all of the trial structures related to a given initial structure are optimized, only the master  procedure is used in comparison.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which  determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is pre-defined.
a barrier-crossing step in the elementary process of the  thermal conformational inter-conversion.
In the CONFLEX search algorithm, the geometry  optimization procedures always take 95% of the elapsed time of the search execution.
