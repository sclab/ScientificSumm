When the remote executable is re-scheduled in different hosts, the initialization is called to initialize the newly allocated  remote module.
The  application using the OmniRPC AIM facility can re-use the initialized data once the data set is initialized.
Therefore, after the Initialize function call to set up common initialization data, a worker program can re-use this data and increase the efficiency of it"s processes.
In OmniRPC , however , when the Initialize remote function is defined in the worker program and a new worker program , corresponding to the other RPC , is assigned to execute , an
