This can eliminate  unnecessary communication and the initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G. CONFLEX-G can achieves performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and exploits more computing resources by allowing the use of multiple PC clusters in the grid.
This feature is especially important in large-scale applications which require lengthy calculation in a grid environment.
In order to explore the conformation of large bio-molecules,  CONFLEXG was used to generate trial structures of the molecules, and allocate jobs to optimize them by molecular mechanics in the grid.
In grid environments in which the environment changes dynamically , it is also necessary to support
