In this paper, we describe CONFLEX-G, a grid-enabled molecular conformational search program, using OmniRPC and report its performance in a grid of several PC  clusters which are geographically distributed.
In order to support a typical application for a grid  environment, such as a parametric search application, in which the same function is executed with different input parameters on the same data set.
Although the parallelized version of CONFLEX was used to calculate in parallel the structure optimization , which takes up over 90 % of the processing in the molecular conformation search , sufficient improvement in the speedup could not
