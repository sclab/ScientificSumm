Since the calculation time for structure  optimization required a great deal of time, the ratio of overhead, including tasks such as the invocation of a worker program and data transmission for initialization, became very small, so that the performance of CONFLEX-G was improved.
When two or more sets of PC clusters are used, the speedup in  performance is hampered by the load imbalance of the  optimization of the trial structures.
â€¢ In this experiment , we used a simple build-in roundrobbin scheduler of OmniRPC , which is necessary in order to apply the scheduler that allocates structures with long optimization
