While the performance with and without feedback on the first few chunks is expected to be close, for subsequent chunks, the performance curve with feedback enabled rises above the one with the no-feedback setting.
It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with Î³ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.
