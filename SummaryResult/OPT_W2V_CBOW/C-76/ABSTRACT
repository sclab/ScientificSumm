To introduce service-oriented event correlation for an IT service provider, an appropriate modeling of the correlation workflow and of the information is necessary.
The paradigm shift from device-oriented to service-oriented management has also implications to the area of event  correlation.

An example scenario , the Web Hosting Service of the Leibniz Supercomputing Center ( LRZ ) , is used to demonstrate the
