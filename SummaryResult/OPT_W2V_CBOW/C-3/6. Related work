Based on such a model a scheduling agent is built that uses the performance model to select the best resource set and the best application schedule on this set.
As the number of available grid resources increases, the accuracy of this approach diminishes, as the subset of possible resource sets that can be examined in a reasonable time becomes smaller.
Another disadvantage of these systems is that the performance degradation detection is suitable only for iterative or regular applications.
In GrADS (18) and ASSIST (1), resource  selection and adaptation requires a performance model that allows predicting application runtimes.
In that
