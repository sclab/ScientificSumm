We find it a reasonable assumption for a grid application, since applications for which the slowest processor becomes a bottleneck will not be able to  efficiently utilize grid resources.
We also assume that the  processors of the sites are accessible using a grid scheduling system, such as Koala (15), Zorilla (9) or GRMS (3).
The second assumption is that the  application can efficiently run on processors with different speeds.
Finally, the application should be  insensitive to wide-area latencies, so it can run efficiently on a  widearea grid (16; 17). 
The first assumption we make is that the application is malleable
