We simulated that the uplink to one of the clusters was overloaded and the bandwidth on this uplink was reduced to approximately 100 KB/s.
Adaptation reduces the iteration time by a factor of 3 (Scenario 1a), 1.7 (Scenario 1b) and 1.2 (Scenario 1c) which allows us to conclude that the gains in the total runtime would be even bigger if the application were run longer than for 15 iterations.
The adaptive  version removes the badly connected cluster after the first monitoring period which brings the iteration duration down to 210 seconds on average.
