In the heterogeneous world, it is hardly beneficial to add  processors if the efficiency is lower than 50% unless the added processor is faster than some of the currently used processors.
This simple adaptation strategy allows us to improve application performance in several situations typical for the Grid: • If an application is started on fewer processors than its degree of parallelism allows, it will automatically expand to more  processors (as soon as there are extra resources available).
• If some of the original resources chosen by the user are inappropriate for the application , for example the bandwidth to
