The adaptation coordinator uses the Registry to discover the application processes, and the application processes use this service to discover each other.
For requesting new nodes, the Zorilla (9) system is used - a peer-to-peer supercomputing middleware which allows  straightforward allocation of processors in multiple clusters and/or  supercomputers.
The  coordinator is implemented as a separate process.
With Satin, the programmer annotates the sequential code with divide-and-conquer primitives and compiles the annotated code with a special Satin compiler that generates the necessary communication and load balancing code.
The Registry provides , among others , a membership service to the processors taking part
