Another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid  environment.
This approach  allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded WAN links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant performance improvements.
We evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the Grid.

Existing solutions to these two problems require that a  performance model for an application is known.
One important problem in grid computing is resource selection ,
