Existing approaches to these  problems typically assume the existence of a performance model that allows predicting application runtimes on various sets of resources.
For  example, the node badness formula could be refined at runtime based on the effectiveness of the previous adaptation decisions.
Our approach also allows the application to adapt to the changing grid conditions.
Our simple adaptation strategy allows us to handle multiple scenarios typical for grid environments : expand to more nodes or shrink to fewer nodes if the application was started on an inappropriate number of processors , remove inadequate nodes and replace them with better
