It is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the duty cycle.
Specifically, we designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the constraint of energy neutral operation.
Our method has significant advantages over currently used methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and can only provide sub-optimal performance.
It is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit these advanced capabilities. 
However, this work is only the first step towards optimal solutions for energy neutral operation.
We also derived a theoretically optimal bound on the performance and showed that our proposed
