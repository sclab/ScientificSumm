A more interesting case is when the harvested energy is used as the primary source of energy for the system with the objective of achieving indefinitely long system lifetime.
More sophisticated methods which track the flow of energy into and out of the battery are also available.
It may be noted that for low power systems with more advanced capabilities such as dynamic voltage scaling ( DVS ) , multiple low power modes , and the capability to shut down system components selectively , the power consumption in each of the states and the resultant effect on application performance should
