In view of the above models for the system components and the required performance, the objective of our power management strategy is adjust the duty cycle D(i) dynamically so as to maximize the total utility U(D) over a period of time, while ensuring energy neutral operation for the sensor node.
For instance, in the case of solar energy harvesting, Nw could be chosen to be a twenty-four hour duration, corresponding to the diurnal cycle in the harvested energy.
Before discussing the performance scaling methods for harvesting aware duty cycle adaptation , let us first consider the optimal power
