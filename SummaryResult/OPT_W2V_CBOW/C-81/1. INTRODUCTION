Energy supply has always been a crucial issue in designing battery-powered wireless sensor networks because the lifetime and utility of the systems are limited by how long the batteries are able to sustain the operation.
Consequently, battery powered systems usually operate at the lowest performance level that meets the minimum data fidelity requirement in order to maximize the system life.
Thus, power management methods based on battery status are not always applicable to energy harvesting systems.
In addition , most power management schemes designed for battery-powered systems only account for the dynamics of the energy consumers ( e.g. , CPU
