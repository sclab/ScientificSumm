Furthermore, we give evidence corroborating the  conjecture that the form of the optimal auction is independent of the benchmark used in the auction"s competitive analysis.
This problem is well studied for the auction design problem where the optimal mechanism is the one that brings the seller the most profit.
â€¢ We give a general technique for converting a limited supply auction into an unlimited supply auction where it is possible to use the competitive ratio of the limited supply auction to obtain a bound on the competitive ratio of the unlimited  supply auction.
Positive results in this direction
