We also show that Î¥3 is not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction, but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive  ratio of the overall auction only a little bit.
The most interesting open question from our work is whether the lower bound from Theorem 2 can be matched by an auction for more than three bidders.
Also, when the number of bidders is greater than three, it might be the case that the optimal auction is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.
We conjecture that it can.
Second , we
