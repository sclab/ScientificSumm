When specifying a symmetric  scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the relative magnitudes of the n âˆ’ 1 bids in b-i and that one of the bids, bj = 1.
We denote the profit of a truthful auction A on input b as A(b).
The expected profit of the auction, E[A(b)], is the sum of the  expected payments made by each bidder, which we denote by pi(b) for bidder i.
This is without loss of generality as ( a ) any lower bound that applies to the n = case also
