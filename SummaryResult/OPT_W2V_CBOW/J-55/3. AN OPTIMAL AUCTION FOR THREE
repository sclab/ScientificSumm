In the optimal two-bidder auction, all inputs with non-identical bids are worst-case, so we will assume the same for three bidders.
Furthermore, the auction raises exactly 6 13 F(2) on every input with non-identical bids.
This motivates considering symmetric scale-invariant auctions for three bidders with probability density function , ρ1 , x ( z ) , of the following form : ρ1 , x ( z ) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 with discrete probability a ( x ) x with discrete probability b ( x ) z with probability density g ( z ) for z > x
