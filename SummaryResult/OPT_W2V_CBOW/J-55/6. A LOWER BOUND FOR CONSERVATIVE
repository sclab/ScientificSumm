For any particular k and H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, .
As this 180 lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge a sales price higher than any bid in the input.
In order to  satisfy our lower bound, (4), on phk (b), it must put at least 3nr−2r−n n−1 on hk.
This gives ρhk ( b ) with nr−1 n−1 probability at 1 and exactly 3nr−2r−n n−1 at each hi for 1 ≤ i < k. Thus , the
