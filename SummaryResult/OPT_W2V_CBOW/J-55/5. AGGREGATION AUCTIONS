Table 1 shows, for each value of m and k, the fraction of F(2) raised by the aggregation auction for AggΥm when there are k winning bidders, assuming the lower bound of Theorem 2 is tight.
We can, however, evaluate this  formula numerically for different values of m and k, assuming that the competitive ratio for Υm matches the lower bound for m given by Theorem 2.
We can numerically optimize the values of s and t in Gs,t(b) in order to achieve the best competitive ratio for the aggregation auction.
