Like the GVA, however, the MIP is computationally demanding and thus careful formulation of the MIP and optimizations based on the observed workloads from Mirage will be required to  ensure timely clearing of the auction.
Realistically, even with a strategyproof LOS scheme for complex bidders there will likely be further strategies we have yet to encounter and that we should consider in our design.
Strategyproofness or, minimally, making the system hard to manipulate is also key given the behavior we have observed.
The challenge is that the current literature is still restricted to non-combinatorial settings. 
Finally , another approach to
