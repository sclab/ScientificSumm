Although we know that it is impossible to have IR, IC and BB in an efficient mechanism it would be interesting to have an upper bound on the approximation to welfare achievable in an IR, IC and BB mechanism.
The GTR procedure improves on existing results such as homogeneous double-sided auctions, distributed markets, and supply chains, and solves several open problems such as distributed markets with strategic transportation edges and bounded paths, combinatorial double-sided auctions with bounded size procurements sets, and combinatorial  doublesided auctions with a bounded number of procurement sets.
The question of the quality of welfare approximation both
