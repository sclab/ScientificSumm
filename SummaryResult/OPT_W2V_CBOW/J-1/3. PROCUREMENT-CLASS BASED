In order to show that the produced mechanism is BB we show that each procurement set that is not reduced has a positive budget (i.e., the sum of payments is positive).
As a possible Ei(A, s) is ∪j∈sRj(A, s) one can bound the maximal value of i"s external competition W(Ei(A, s)) by the sum of the maximal values of the rest of the players in s 8 since the domain is a procurement class domain we can use lemma 3.1 24 internal competition i.e., j∈s max W(Rj(A, s)).
We start by proving
