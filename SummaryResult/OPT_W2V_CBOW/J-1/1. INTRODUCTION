For supply chain problems [2, 4] bounds the loss of social welfare that is necessary to inflict on the mechanism in order to achieve the desired combination of IR, IC, and BB.
To maintain the BB property in an IR and IC mechanism it is necessary to compromise on the optimality of the social welfare.
Despite the works discussed above, the question of how to design a general mechanism that achieves IR, IC, and BB independently of the problem domain remains open.
Some of the more important ones are individual rationality ( IR ) - to make it worthwhile for
