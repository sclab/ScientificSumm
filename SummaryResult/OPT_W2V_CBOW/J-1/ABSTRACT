Furthermore, our solution provides  budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed  markets with strategic transportation edges.
In particular, our results improve on existing  solutions for problems such as double sided markets with  homogenous goods, distributed markets and several kinds of supply chains.
There have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by  trading welfare for BB, e.g., in domains such as double-sided auctions[13], distributed markets[3] and supply chain  problems[2, 4].
In this paper we provide a procedure called a Generalized Trade Reduction ( GTR ) for single-value players , which given
