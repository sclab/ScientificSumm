9 Note that for any particular Di this might not be IC as GTR-1 is IC only for procurement class domains and not for general domains 10 In Appendix A we show how to calculate D0 in  polynoFormally, Let D be the set of all dividing functions D. Denote the welfare achieved by the mechanism produced by  GTR1 when using dividing function D and a set of bids ¯b by GTR1(D,¯b).
So by reducing the number of equivalence classes |ec| procurement sets we cover all the remaining players with internal competition.
By theorem 3.1 it suffices to prove
