We propose a cluster-based method for  selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback.
With term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without  interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query expansion process.

Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback.
