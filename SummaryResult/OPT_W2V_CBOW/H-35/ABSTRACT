Ideally a learning  algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data.
Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by  minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures.
In the task, a model is automatically created with some training data and then is utilized for ranking of documents.
Our algorithm,  referred to as AdaRank, repeatedly constructs â€˜weak rankers" on the basis of re-weighted training data and finally linearly combines the weak rankers for making ranking predictions.
We prove that the training process of AdaRank is
