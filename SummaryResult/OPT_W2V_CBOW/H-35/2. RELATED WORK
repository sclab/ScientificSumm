[19] also propose a method of directly maximizing rank-based metrics for ranking on the basis of manifold learning.
AdaRank is also one that tries to directly optimize multivariate  performance measures, but is based on a different approach.
They are â€˜learning to rank", boosting, and direct optimization of performance measures.
2.1 Information Retrieval The key problem for document retrieval is ranking, specifically, how to create the ranking model (function) that can sort documents based on their relevance to the given query.
In the pair-wise approach to ranking , the learning task is formalized as a problem of classifying instance pairs
