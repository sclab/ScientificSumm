Experimental results based on four benchmark datasets show that AdaRank can significantly outperform the baseline methods of BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost.
Future work includes theoretical analysis on the generalization error and other properties of the AdaRank algorithm, and further empirical evaluations of the algorithm including comparisons with other algorithms that can directly optimize performance measures. 
AdaRank offers several advantages: ease of implementation, theoretical soundness, efficiency in training, and high accuracy in ranking.
It employs a boosting technique in ranking model learning.
In this paper we have proposed a novel algorithm for learning ranking models in document retrieval , referred
