We also conducted t-test on the improvements of AdaRank.NDCG over BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost in terms of NDCG@5.
Next we evaluated the accuracies of AdaRank.MAP and RankBoost in terms of MAP for each of the query group.
Specifically, we trained ranking models using AdaRank.MAP and AdaRank.NDCG and evaluated their accuracies on the training dataset in terms of both MAP and NDCG@5.
We further conducted an experiment to see whether AdaRank has the ability to improve the ranking accuracy in terms of a measure by using the measure in training.
We can see that the numbers of document
