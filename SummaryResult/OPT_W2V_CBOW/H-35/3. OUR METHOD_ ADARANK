The learning process turns out to be that of minimizing the loss function which represents the disagreement between the  permutation π(qi, di, f) and the list of ranks yi, for all of the queries.
The objective of learning is to create a ranking function f : X → , such that for each query the elements in its corresponding  document list can be assigned relevance scores using the function and then be ranked according to the scores.
In AdaBoost , the distribution of weights on training instances is calculated according to the current distribution and the performance of the current weak
