AdaRank can be viewed as a machine learning method for direct optimization of performance measures, based on a different approach.
All the existing methods used for  document retrieval [2, 3, 8, 13, 16, 20] are designed to optimize loss functions loosely related to the IR performance measures, not loss functions directly based on the measures.
A lower bound of the performance on training data is given, which indicates that the ranking accuracy in terms of the performance measure can be continuously improved during the training process.
In training , a ranking model is constructed with data consisting of queries ,
