An adaptive, multi-agent approach is an ideal fit to this naturally distributed problem where the complex interaction among the aircraft, airports and traffic controllers renders a pre-determined centralized solution severely suboptimal at the first deviation from the expected plan.
The Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NGATS) initiative aims to address this issues and, not only account for a threefold increase in traffic, but also for the increasing heterogeneity of aircraft and decreasing restrictions on flight paths.
Though a truly distributed and adaptive solution ( e.g. , free flight where aircraft can choose almost any path ) offers the most potential
