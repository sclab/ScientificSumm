Instead it  focuses on the amount of congestion in a particular sector and on the amount of measured air traffic delay.
The flow control problem has to address the integration of policies across these sectors and centers, account for the complexity of the system (e.g., over 5200 public use airports and 16,000 air traffic controllers) and handle changes to the policies caused by weather  patterns.
The exponential penalty is intended to provide strong feedback to return the number of aircraft in a sector to below the FAA mandated capacities. 
Two of the fundamental problems in addressing the flow problem are
