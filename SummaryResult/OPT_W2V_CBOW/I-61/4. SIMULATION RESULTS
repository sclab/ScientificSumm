To verify that the performance improvement of our methods is maintained when there are a different number of agents, we perform additional experiments with 50 agents.
The second congestion is less severe than the first one, so agents have to form different policies depending which point of congestion they are influencing.
Note, however, that the benefit of the estimated difference rewards are only present later in learning.
These values of Ï„ are obtained by examining the time at which most of the aircraft leave the sectors, when no congestion control is being performed.
