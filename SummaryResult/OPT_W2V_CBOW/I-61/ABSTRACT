Finding reliable and adaptive solutions to the flow management problem is of paramount importance if the Next Generation Air Transportation  Systems are to achieve the stated goal of accommodating three times the current traffic volume.
This problem is  particularly complex as it requires the integration and/or  coordination of many factors including: new data (e.g., changing weather info), potentially conflicting priorities (e.g.,  different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and very heavy traffic volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace).
Agents use reinforcement learning to set this separation and their actions speed up or slow down traffic to
