Instead the model we have presented in this paper makes explicit the particular states of the  environment in which agents are situated and are attempting to gradually align their ontological entities.
In this paper we have exposed a formal model of semantic alignment as a sequence of information-channel refinements that are relative to the particular states of the environment in which two agents communicate and align their respective conceptualisations of these states.
We plan to further refine the model presented here ( e.g. , to include pragmatic issues such as termination criteria for the alignment process ) and to devise
