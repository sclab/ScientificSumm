For example, for the recommendation system game, a highly compact  representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products, and let the algorithms that operate on the representation to compute the values of coalitions  appropriately.
Unfortunately, given that the number of degrees of  freedom of coalitional games is O(2n ), not all games can be  represented concisely using a single scheme due to information theoretic constraints.
The resulting game can be analyzed using coalitional game theory , and we can answer questions such as the stability of coalitions , and how to fairly divide the benefits
