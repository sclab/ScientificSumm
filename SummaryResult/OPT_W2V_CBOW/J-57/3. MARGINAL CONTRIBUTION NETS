Given a game represented as a MC-net, we can interpret the set of rules that make up the game as a graph.
Clearly this takes exactly the same space as the size of G, and by the additive semantics of the rules, it represents the same game as G. 
The nodes in the graph will  represent the agents in the game, and for each rule in the  MCnet, we connect all the agents in the rule together and assign a value to the clique formed by the set of agents.
We would like to end our discussion of the representation
