One direction to increase the conciseness of MC-nets is to allow the definition of  equivalent classes of agents, similar to the idea of extending Bayes nets to probabilistic relational models.
We have developed a fully expressive representation scheme for coalitional games of which the size depends on the  complexity of the interactions among the agents.
We have also developed an efficient  algorithm for the computation of the Shapley values for this representation.
We believe that with a better understanding of the relationships among these related areas , we may be able to develop more efficient representations and algorithms for coalitional
