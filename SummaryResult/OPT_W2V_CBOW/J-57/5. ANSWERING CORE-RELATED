To determine if the payoff vector x is in the core, during the r-value computation at each node, we can check if all of the r-values are non-negative.
Our algorithm works by keeping track of the reserves of all non-empty subsets that can be formed by the agents of a node at each of the nodes of the tree decomposition.
Therefore, if Râˆ— is not disjoint from Xroot, the r-value for some group in the root is negative.
Starting from the leaves of the tree and working towards the root , at each node i , our algorithm computes the
