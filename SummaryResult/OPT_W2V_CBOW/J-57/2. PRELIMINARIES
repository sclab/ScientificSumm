While this representation can represent all games that are superadditive, there are coalitional games that it cannot  represent.
On the other hand, there is an efficient algorithm for  computing the Shapley value of the game, and for determining whether the core is empty under the restriction of positive edge weights.
In fact, even determining the value of a group of agents is NP-complete.
This set of weights , ( λS ) S⊆N , is a balanced collection if for all i ∈ N , S⊆N λS ( 1S ) i = 1 A game is balanced if for all
