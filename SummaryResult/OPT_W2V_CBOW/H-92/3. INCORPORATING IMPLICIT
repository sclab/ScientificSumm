Hence, we will also use RankNet as a generic ranker to explore the contribution of implicit feedback for different ranking alternatives. 
The approach above assumes that there are no interactions between the underlying features producing the original web search ranking and the implicit feedback features.
3.1 Implicit Feedback as Independent Evidence The general approach is to re-rank the results obtained by a web search engine according to observed clickthrough and other user interactions for the query in previous search sessions.
We use a 2-layer implementation of RankNet in order to model non-linear relationships between features.
3.2 Ranking with Implicit Feedback
