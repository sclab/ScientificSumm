To this end, we explore different approaches for ranking web search results using real user behavior obtained as part of normal interactions with the web search engine.
While it is intuitive that user interactions with the web search engine should reveal at least some information that could be used for ranking, estimating user preferences in real web search settings is a challenging problem, since real user interactions tend to be more noisy than commonly assumed in the controlled settings of previous studies.
Our paper explores whether implicit feedback can be helpful in realistic environments , where user feedback can be
