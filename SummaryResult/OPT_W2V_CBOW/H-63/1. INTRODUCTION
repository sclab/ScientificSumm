A simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.
Access efficiency and energy conservation are the two issues which are significant for data broadcast systems.
Location dependent data, its generation and subsequent broadcast is presented in section 4.
For broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency.
But there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems
