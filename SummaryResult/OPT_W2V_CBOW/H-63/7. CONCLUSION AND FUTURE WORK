The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture.
We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.
We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging architecture significantly improves the latency for global as well as local query. 
We have presented an example to show how the hierarchical structure of the location tree maps with the data to create LDD
