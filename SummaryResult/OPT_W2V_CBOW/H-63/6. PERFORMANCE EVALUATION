As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.
But as the length of broadcast increases, it is clearly visible the LBIS outperforms the other two schemes.
This may be attributed both due to increase in time required to scan the intermediate Minor Indexes and the length of the broadcast.
This large tuning time is due to the fact that after reaching the lowest minor index , the MU may have to access
