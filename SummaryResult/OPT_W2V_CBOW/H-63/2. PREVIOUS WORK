The distributed indexing method was proposed to efficiently replicate and distribute the index tree in a broadcast.
All of the above mentioned schemes have been applied to data which are non related to each other.
In this scheme, a parameterized index, called the exponential index is used to optimize the access latency or the tuning time.
Each broadcast consists of the replicated part and the  nonreplicated part that indexes the data items immediately following it.
The first bucket in each data segment contains a control index , which is a binary index mapping a given key value to the segment
