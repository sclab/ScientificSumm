in social networks with a low average degree.2 Since the solution quality clearly depends on the resource ratio as well as on the degree of the social network, we study the effect of changing both, to see whether they influence each other.
We also notice from the graph that the solution quality of the GDAP on all three networks is quite high (over 0.8) when the available resource is very limited (0.3).
For the next experiment we fix the resource ratio to 1.0 and study the quality of both the upper bound and the GDAP algorithm related to the degree
