Each task t ∈ T can only be allocated to agents that are (direct) neighbors of agent loc(t) in the social network SN.
Given a set of agents A connected by a social network SN = (A, AE), and a finite set of tasks T , the social task allocation problem (or STAP for short) is the problem of finding the efficient task allocation φ, such that φ is valid and the social welfare Uφ is maximized. 
, am } in a social network SN , a task allocation is a mapping φ : T × A × R → N.
