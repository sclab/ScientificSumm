In this paper we studied the task allocation problem in a social network (STAP), which can be seen as a new, more general, variant of the TAP.
We are  interested in seeing how such interactions will affect the  performance of task allocation in different social networks.
Finally, we used the optimal solution and the upper-bound (for larger instances) to conduct an  extensive set of experiments to assess the solution quality and the computational efficiency of the proposed distributed  algorithm in different types of networks, namely, small-world networks, random networks, and scale-free networks.
There are many interesting extensions to our current
