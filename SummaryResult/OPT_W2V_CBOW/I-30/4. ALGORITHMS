If the maximum flow in each network is equal to the total required resources of that type, the current combination of tasks is feasible.
A bid consists of all the resources the agent is able to supply for this task.
Next the task with the highest efficiency can be selected by each contractor in O(n).
Our method for efficiently calculating an upper bound for STAP makes use of this special case by converting any given STAP instance P into a new problem P where each task only has one resource type.
They start with offering the task that is
