Then, with a+, = a-1 = a,~, and  considering that the resulting service has to be best effort in the long term, we have: aopo + a+lp+l + LIP-1 A ape Qlll@+l fP-1) = (a--oo)m P - l = zpo-p+1 (5) Due to this relationship between the drop probability for +l and -1 packets, we designate this queue  management algorithm as Differential RED (DiERED).
The necessary relationship between the drop probabilities for packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85 follows ( note that this relationship is valid both at the end-tend level and every individual hop ) : Let a
