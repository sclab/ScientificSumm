The run-length model implies a geometric distribution for residing in state X = m. For the probability of a burst loss length of k packets we thus can compute estimates for  performance parameters in a higher order model representation (note that here Y represent the random variable used in the higher-order models).
Then the probability of being in state m can be seen BS the uncow ditional loss probability ulp and approximated by the mean loss (pr.
Only one conditional loss probability clp for the transition 1 -- t 1 exists : p~ , E-d = CFL ( ~ - lbd
