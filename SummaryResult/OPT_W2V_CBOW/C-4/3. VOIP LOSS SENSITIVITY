We can see from Figure 9 that the position of a frame loss has a signilicant inlluence cm the resulting signal degradation", while the degradation is not that sensitive to the length of the frame loss burst k. The loss of unvoiced frames seems to have a rather small impact on the signal degradation and the decoder recovers the state information fast  thereafter.
Rosenberg has done a similar experiment ([9]), showing that the difference between the original and the concealed signal with increasing loss burstiness in terms of a mean-squared error is significant, however.
By averaging the result of
