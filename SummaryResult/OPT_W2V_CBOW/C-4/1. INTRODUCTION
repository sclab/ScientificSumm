Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way  (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate.
The adaptation of the sender"s bitrate to the current  network congestion state as an intraflow QoS scheme (loss avoidance, [IS]) is difficult to apply to voice.
Let us now consider the case that 50 % of packets of a flow are identified as more important ( designated by
