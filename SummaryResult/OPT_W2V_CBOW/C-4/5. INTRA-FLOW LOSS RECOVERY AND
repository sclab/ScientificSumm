The results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that, while the loss of some of the +l packets has some  measurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be considered to be very low. 
This also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a minor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained.
449 Figure 15: Perceptual Distortion (EMBSD) for the marking schemes and SPB-FEC which uses redundancy9 piggybacked on the main payload packets (RFC 2198, [7]) to protect a subset of the packets, enables a very good output speech quality for low loss rates.
