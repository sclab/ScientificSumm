Contrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the concealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break at transitions within the speech signal however, thus  showing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.
We have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm which is able to control loss patterns without changing the amount of loss and characterized its performance for the loss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity.
In this paper we have characterized the behaviour of a  samplebased codec (PCM) and a frame-based codec (G.729) in the presence of packet loss.
This is the case because they neither need the addition
