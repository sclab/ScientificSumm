In both cases, we use a CEP (circular error probable) measure of accuracy, the radius of the circle that one would have to draw around each prediction to capture 50% of the actual unit locations.
In the experiments reported here, we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way.
In the one case where we called a chicken a Rambo, logs show that in fact the unit was being played aggressively, rushing toward oncoming Blue forces.
Analysis of these units shows that these characterizations were appropriate : units
