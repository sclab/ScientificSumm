It is inspired by  techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical  systems, in which a representation of the system is continually fit to its recent past behavior.
Work to date  focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state (as opposed to the emotional state) of a single agent (as opposed to an  interacting community), and frequently takes advantage of explicit  communications between agents (as in managing conversational  protocols).
In BEE, it is a set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents  representing the individuals being analyzed.
Many realistic problems deviate from these conditions.
