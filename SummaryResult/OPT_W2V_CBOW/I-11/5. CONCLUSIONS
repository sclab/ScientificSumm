Our initial limited repertoire of emotions is a small subset of those that have been distinguished by psychologists, and that might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior.
The basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as well , requiring much less additional engineering than other more traditional ways of reasoning
