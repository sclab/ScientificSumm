First, we can generate the pheromone fields directly from the observed locations of individual entities, so there is no need for the ghosts to make deposits.
The distribution of each pheromone flavor over the  environment forms a field that represents some aspect of the state of the world at an instant in time.
Emotions are modeled as agent hormones (internal pheromones) that are augmented in the presence of the triggering environmental condition and evaporate over time.
BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation.
