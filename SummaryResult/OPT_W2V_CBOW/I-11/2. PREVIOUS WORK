Actual simulation of futures is one way (the only one we know now) to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agent"s actions.
A rational analysis of an agent"s goals may enable us to  predict what it will attempt, but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the  environment, and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well.
