The setting λ = ln N is special in the sense that the frequency-based and the Poisson-based informativeness have the same denominator, namely ln N, and the Poisson sum converges to λ.
For the frequency-based idf , the gradient is monotonously decreasing and we obtain for different collections the same distances of idf -values, i. e. the parameter N does not affect the distance.
The setting π = e−2000/6 leads to noise values of approximately e−2000/6 in the interval [λ1; λ2], the logarithms lead then to 1/6 for the informativeness.
Independence of documents leads to Poisson , where we have to be aware
