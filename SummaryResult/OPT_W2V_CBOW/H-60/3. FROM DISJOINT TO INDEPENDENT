We introduce the event notation t is noisy and t occurs for making the difference between the noise probability P(t is noisy|c) in a collection and the occurrence probability P(t occurs|d) in a document more explicit, thereby keeping in mind that the noise  probability corresponds to the occurrence probability of a term in a collection.
For a collection with infinite many documents , the upper bound of the noise probability for terms tN that occur in all documents becomes : lim N→∞ Pin ( tN is noisy ) = lim N→∞ 1 − 1 − λ N N
