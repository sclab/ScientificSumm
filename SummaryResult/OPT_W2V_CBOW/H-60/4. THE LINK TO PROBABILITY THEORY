With this definition of p, we obtain for an infinite number of documents the following limit for the product of the binomial coefficient and pk : lim N→∞ N k pk = = lim N→∞ N · (N −1) · .
4.2 Binomial distribution The binomial probability function yields the probability that k of N events are true where each event is true with the single event probability p. P ( k ) : = binom ( N , k , p ) : = N k pk ( 1 − p ) N −k The single event probability is usually defined as p
