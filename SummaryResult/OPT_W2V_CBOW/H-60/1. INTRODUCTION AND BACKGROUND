Can we interpret Pfreq , the normalised idf , as the probability that the term is informative?
When investigating the probabilistic interpretation of the 227 normalised idf , we made several observations related to  disjointness and independence of document events.
With N being the total number of documents , and n ( t ) being the number of documents in which term t occurs , the idf is defined as follows : idf ( t ) : = − log n ( t ) N , 0 < = idf ( t ) < ∞ Ranking based on the sum of the idf
