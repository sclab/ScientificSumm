Our methods" predictions of relevance preferences are substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art search result ranking that does not consider user interactions.
Our paper is the first, to our knowledge, to interpret  postsearch user behavior to estimate user preferences in a real web search setting.
While our techniques perform well on average, our assumptions about clickthrough distributions (and learning the user behavior models) may not hold equally well for all queries.
Alternatively, our models could be used directly to detect anomalies in user behavior - either due to abuse or to operational problems with the search engine.
