Our UserBehavior strategy achieves recall of over 0.43 with precision of over 0.67 (with much higher precision at lower recall levels), substantially outperforms the current search engine preference ranking and all other implicit feedback interpretation methods. 
Furthermore, Browsing features alone have higher precision (with lower maximum recall achieved) than considering all of the features in our UserBehavior model.
Incorporating post-search navigation history in addition to clickthroughs (Browsing features) results in the highest recall and precision among all methods compared.
As expected, Recall of both strategies improves quickly with more days of interaction data examined.
