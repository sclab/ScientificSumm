ICE is a hybrid auction design, in that it couples  simple item prices to drive bidding in early rounds with  combinatorial WD and payments, a feature it shares with the clock-proxy design of Ausubel et al.
In computing the prices, we adopt the methods of constraint-generation to exploit the structure of the bidding language and avoid  enumerating all feasible trades.
Another variation on the WD problem is formulated, both to verify that the activity rule is met and also to  provide feedback to a bidder to explain how to meet the rule.
