We take  advantage of the commonality of these problems by using common LP/MIP builders that differ only by a few functional hooks to provide the correct variables for optimization.
In addition to the core exchange discussed in this paper, we have developed an agent component that allows a user to simulate the  behavior and knowledge of other players in the system, better allowing a user to formulate their strategy in advance of actual play.
We have generalized our back-end optimization solver interface11 ( we currently support CPLEX and the LGPL- licensed LPSolve ) , and can take advantage of the
