We intend to study the elicitation properties of the exchange and we have put together a test suite of exchange problem instances.
In addition, we are beginning to engage in collaborations to apply the design to airline takeoff and landing slot scheduling and to resource allocation in  widearea network distributed computational systems.
The  design includes many interesting features, including: a new bid-tree language for exchanges, a new method to construct approximate linear prices from expressive languages, and a proxied elicitation method with optimistic and pessimistic valuations with a new method to evaluate a revealed-  preference activity rule.
The next steps
