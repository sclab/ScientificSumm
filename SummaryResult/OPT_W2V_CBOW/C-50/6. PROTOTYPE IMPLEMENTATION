However, these results are premature at present for two reasons: (1) They are generated via simulation of hikers walking at random; and (2) It is not clear what impact the erasing of witness records has on the accuracy of inferred location/hot search areas of lost hikers.
The goal of this experiment is to illustrate that  CenWits can deduce the trail a hiker takes by processing witness information.
For example , the witness records generated by 3 at record times 76 , 78 and 79 ( see Table 3 ) have all been generated due a single contact between access point
