It has amply been noted that the strength of sensor  networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.
As a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.
In particular , it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter , organize and store important information , combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods , and intermittent
