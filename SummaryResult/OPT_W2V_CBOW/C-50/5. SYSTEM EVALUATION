Given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500 mAh, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of transmission and reception.
Notice that this  calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds.
Assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.
Also , this time period will significantly increase when groups
