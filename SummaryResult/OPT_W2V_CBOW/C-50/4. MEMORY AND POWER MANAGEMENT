The MAX HOP COUNT parameter provides a balance between two conflicting goals: (1) To ensure that a witness record has been propagated to and thus stored at as many nodes as possible, so that it has a high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory of all sensor nodes.
The goal of this protocol is to ensure that a node transmits only as much witness information as the
