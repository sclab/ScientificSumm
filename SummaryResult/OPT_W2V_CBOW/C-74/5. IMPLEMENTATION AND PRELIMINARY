One consequence of the dimensioning problem is that  scalability may be seriously impacted in peer-to-peer  middleware for mobile computing due to the resource poverty of the devices (limited memory to store temporarily messages) and the number of possible interconnections in ad-hoc  settings.
This problem arises because of the lack of intelligence in the epidemic protocol, and can be addressed by selecting carrier nodes for messages with greater care.
Moreover , the epidemic algorithms are able to guarantee a high delivery ratio if one evaluates performance over a time interval sufficient for the dissemination of the replicas of messages ( i.e.
