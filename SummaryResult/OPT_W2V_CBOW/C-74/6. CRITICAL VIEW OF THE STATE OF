The importance that we attribute to disconnections makes  persistence a vital requirement for any middleware that needs to be used in mobile ad-hoc networks.
THE ART The design of middleware platforms for mobile  computing requires researchers to answer new and fundamentally different questions; simply assuming the presence of wired portions of the network on which centralised functionality can reside is not generalisable.
Different configurations of these components are possible; with respect to mobile ad hoc networks applications, the most interesting is  Serverless JMS.
The main components of this typically infrastructure-based architecture are the JMS provider , the so-called mobile JMS
