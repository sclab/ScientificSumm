Instead, they simply apply a standard SVM at the sentence-level and focus primarily on a linguistic analysis of how the sentence can be logically reformulated before adding it to the task list.
Additionally, they do not study alternative choices or approaches to the classification task.
In this study, we examine several alternative  classification methods, compare document-level and sentence-level  approaches and analyze the machine learning issues implicit in these problems.
We consider action-items to be an important specific type of speech act that falls within their more general classification.
For example , in a forum dedicated to e-mail learning tasks ,
