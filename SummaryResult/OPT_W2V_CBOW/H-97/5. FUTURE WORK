Since the simple bag-of-words representation at the document-level leads to a learned model that behaves somewhat like a context-specific prior dependent on the sender/receiver and general topic, a first choice would be to treat it as such when combining probability estimates with the sentence-level classifier.
Finally, it would be interesting to investigate the best methods for combining the document-level and sentence-level classifiers.
Such methods include alternate ways of combining the predictions over each  sentence, weightings other than tfidf, which may not be appropriate since sentences are small, better sentence segmentation, and other types of phrasal analysis.
Such a model might
