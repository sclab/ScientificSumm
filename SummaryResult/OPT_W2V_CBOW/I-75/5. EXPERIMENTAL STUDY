In this case, the local protocol is different (note in  particular that it does not guarantee mutual consistency), but the global protocol remains the same (at the only exception that agents" motivation to communicate is to synchronise their list of observations, not their hypothesis).
Figure 4: Ratio gain of local broadcast over  hypotheses exchange Note to begin with that the ratio gain is 0 when the  proportion of agents is 5%, which is easily explained by the fact that it corresponds to situations involving only two agents.
This illustrates that the design of the global protocol can not be
