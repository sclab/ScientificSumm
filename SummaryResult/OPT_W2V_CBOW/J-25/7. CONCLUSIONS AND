A natural question is to determine whether a market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances this may occur.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have analyzed the computational complexity of  matching for securities based on logical formulas.
We may consider a market to be in computational  equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find a strategy that increases utility.
Although matching is likely intractable, are there good heuristics that achieve matches in many cases or  approximate a matching?
