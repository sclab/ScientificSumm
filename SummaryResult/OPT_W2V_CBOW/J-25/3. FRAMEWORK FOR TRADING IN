Let αi be the fraction of order oi accepted by the auctioneer (in the indivisible case, αi must be either 0 or 1; in the divisible case, αi can range from 0 to 1).
We also call the auctioneer"s payoff vector the surplus vector, since it is the (possibly state-contingent) money left over after all accepted orders are filled.
The auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy and sell orders to maximize surplus (the cash and securities left over after accepted bids are fulfilled).
Alternatively , the auctioneer could choose to accept 4/3 units of bid 1
