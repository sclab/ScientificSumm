We show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Î£p 2-complete in the indivisible case.
A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk  exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum.
We then analyze in  detail the auctioneer"s matching problem.
Buying or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit ( in expectation
