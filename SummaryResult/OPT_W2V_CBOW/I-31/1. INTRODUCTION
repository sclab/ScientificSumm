One of the goals of this paper is to investigate the  representational and logical capabilities an agent needs for judgment and preference aggregation; that is, what kind of logical language might be used to represent and reason about judgment aggregation?
We obtain a sound and complete axiomatisation of the logic for preference aggregation as well.
The axiomatisation is parameterised in such a way that we can instantiate it to get a range of different judgment  aggregation logics.
In order to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be able to express , take the example of
