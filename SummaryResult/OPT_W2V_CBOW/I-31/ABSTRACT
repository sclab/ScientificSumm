The logic is parameterised in such a way that it can be used as a general framework for comparing the logical properties of different types of aggregation - including classical preference aggregation.
We present a modal logic that is intended to support reasoning about judgment aggregation scenarios (and hence, as a special case, about preference aggregation): the logical language is interpreted directly in judgment aggregation rules.
The recently emerging field of  judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective, and considers how multiple sets of logical formulae can be  aggregated to a single consistent set.
As a special case , judgment
