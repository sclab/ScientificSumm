When this formula is interpreted as a statement about a social welfare function, it says that there exists a preference profile such that for all pairs (a, b) of alternatives, b is preferred over a in the aggregation (by the SWF) of the preference profile if and only if agent i prefers b over a.
We can then interpret our formulae in an SWF F over K , a preference profile L ∈ L ( K ) and a pair ( a , b ) ⊆ K × K , a b , as follows : F , L ,
