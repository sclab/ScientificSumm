For example, if the agenda contains some formula which is inconsistent in the underlying logic (and, by implication, some tautology), then the following hold: |=L (i ∧ σ) - for every judgment profile, there is some agenda item (take a tautology) which both agent i and the JAR judges to be true But this property does not hold when every agenda item is  consistent with respect to the underlying logic.
The model checking problem for judgment aggregation logic , assuming the representation of JARs described above , is Δp 2-hard ; it is np-hard even if the formula to be checked
