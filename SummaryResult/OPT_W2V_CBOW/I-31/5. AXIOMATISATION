It is then easy to verify that, for every Δ ∈ Tables, and every formula ϕ, Δ |= ϕ iff ϕ ∈ Δ, where |= here means truth in the ordinary modal logic sense when the set of states is taken to be Tables.
In fact, our  axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of f. To be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ.
We point out that jal has all the axioms taut , K , T , 4 , 5 and the rules MP
