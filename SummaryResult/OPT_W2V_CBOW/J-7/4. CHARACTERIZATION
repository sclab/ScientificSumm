Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with  technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any  sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and the vertices in SB have strategy B.
The inequalities for the vertices v âˆˆ SB can be derived in a similar manner.
Then for any schedule S of vertices in V ( G ) \ T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many times , the outcome
