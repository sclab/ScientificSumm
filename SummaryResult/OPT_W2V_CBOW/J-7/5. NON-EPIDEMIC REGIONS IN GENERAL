Thus , recalling that q > 1/2 , we see u '' s payoff with strategy B is q ( zAB + zB ) whereas his payoff with strategy AB is q ( zAB + zB ) + ( 1 − q ) zA − c. In order for this strategic change to improve u '' s payoff , it must be the case that ( 1 − q ) zA ≥ c. ( 1 ) Now , notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qzA + c
