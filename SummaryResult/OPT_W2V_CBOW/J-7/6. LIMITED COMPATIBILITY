We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ, there is a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two  incumbent technologies B and C may find it beneficial to increase their compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new  superior technology A.
We first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is  equivalent to a game without these entries, under a simple re-scaling of q and r. Note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive or a multiplicative constant, the behavior of the game is unaffected.
We now show
