Given an observation G as a conjunction of literals and NAF-literals possibly containing variables, we introduce a new ground literal O together with the rule O ← G. In this case, O has an explanation (E, F) iff G has the same explanation.
If G is a ground literal, compute its minimal  explanation (E, F) in P, H using the update program.
If G is a ground literal and the program P ∪ { ← not G } has a  consistent answer set, put G in Sn.
In contrast , the rule −L ← not L derives the atom −L if an
