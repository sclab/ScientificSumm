A set S of ground literals satisfies the  conjunction G if { L1θ, .
Given a conjunction G of (NAF-)literals, Gθ denotes the conjunction obtained by applying θ to G. A program, rule, or literal is ground if it contains no variable.
E and F are sets of ground literals such that E ⊆ H\P and F ⊆ H ∩ P. When (P \ F) ∪ E has an answer set S satisfying the above three conditions, S is called a belief set of an abductive  program P, H satisfying G (with respect to (E, F)).
Given an NAF-free EDP P ,
