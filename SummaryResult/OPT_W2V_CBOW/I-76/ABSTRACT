We provide a negotiation  protocol based on the exchange of these proposals and develop procedures for computing new proposals.
These techniques are respectively used for producing conditional proposals and neighborhood proposals in the process of negotiation.
Then, we introduce methods of constructing counter-proposals in response to proposals made by an agent.
This paper studies a logical framework for automated  negotiation between two agents.
To this end, we combine the techniques of extended abduction in artificial intelligence and relaxation in cooperative query answering for databases.
We suppose an agent who has a knowledge base represented by a logic program.
