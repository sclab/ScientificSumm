This problem is non-trivial since typical mobile object frameworks consist of multiple application and middleware components, and thus metrics collection must be performed at different locations and the results efficiently propagated to the adaptation engine.
Effective adaptation requires detailed and up to date information about both the system and the software itself.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the general structure and implementation of mobile object frameworks in order to understand the challenges related to the collection, propagation and delivery of metrics as described in section 3.
In the case of MobJeX , although
