Firstly, a host manager (known as a service in MobJeX) provides a central point of communication by running on a known port on a per host basis, thus facilitating the enumeration or lookup of components such as runtimes or mobile objects.

Mobile object frameworks allow some of these objects to be tagged as mobile objects, providing middleware support for such objects to be moved at runtime to other hosts.
In general , an object-oriented application consists of objects collaborating to provide the functionality required by a given problem
