Since a MetricsContainer can have multiple Metric objects, of which it has explicit domain knowledge, it is able to determine if, when, and how many of these metrics should be propagated to the ModelEntity and thus become candidates for being part of the hierarchical ModelEntity push process as described below.
The measurement of Number of Invocations (NI) and Execution Time (ET) metrics can be also be performed via direct measurement, however in this case within the mobile object implementation (mobject) itself.
In the specialised case of the push criterion for the proxy , the decision making is based on both
