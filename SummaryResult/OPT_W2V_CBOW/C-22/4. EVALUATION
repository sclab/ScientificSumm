Worst case performance characteristics The next step was to determine the percentage metrics collection overhead compared with execution time in order to provide information about the execution characteristics of objects that would be suitable for adaptation using this metric collection approach.
In addition, the push criterion was also implemented on the service, in order to provide an evaluation of controlling the frequency of metrics delivery to the adaptation engine.
It can be seen that the independent factors of increasing the number of mobjects and methods independently are linear.
These results are encouraging since even for the worst case scenario of
