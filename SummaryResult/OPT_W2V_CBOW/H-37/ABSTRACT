However, similar  performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam filtering.
Spam is a key problem in electronic communication,  including large-scale email systems and the growing number of blogs.
First, we show that online SVMs indeed give state-of-the-art classification performance on online spam filtering on large benchmark data sets.
Additionally, practitioners cite the high cost of SVMs as reason to prefer faster (if less statistically robust) Bayesian methods.
Content-based filtering is one reliable method of  combating this threat in its various forms, but some academic researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam.
The former
