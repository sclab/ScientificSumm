Because  previous work (and our own initial testing) indicates that binary feature values give the best results for spam filtering [20, 9], we optimized our implementation of the Online SMO to exploit fast inner-products with binary vectors.
Because of the small size of the data set, and because prior researchers did not conduct their experiments in an on-line setting, we test the performance of linear SVMs using leave-one-out cross validation, with SVM-Light, a standard open-source SVM implementation [14].
That is , an SVM is trained on an entire set of training data , and is then tested on a separate
