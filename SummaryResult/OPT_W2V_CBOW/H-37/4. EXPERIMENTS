Note that these parameter values were selected as those allowing ROSVM to achieve comparable performance results with Online SVMs, in order to test total difference in computational cost.
Our initial tests showed that the maximum number of iterations used by Online SMO was rarely much larger than 10 on content-based spam detection; thus we tested values of T = {1, 2, 5, âˆž}.
The results for these tests are appear in Figure 7 , and show that there is a slight degradation in performance with reduced values of M , and that this degradation in performance is accompanied by an increase
