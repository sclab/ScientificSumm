Finally, we note that the success of relaxed SVM methods for content-based spam detection is a result that depends on the nature of spam data, which is potentially subject to change.
Although it is currently true that ham and spam are linearly separable given an appropriate feature space, this assumption may be subject to attack.
It is natural to ask why the task of content-based spam  detection gets strong performance from ROSVM.
These indicative features may be sparsely represented in the data set , because of spam methods such as word obfuscation , in which common spam words are intentionally
