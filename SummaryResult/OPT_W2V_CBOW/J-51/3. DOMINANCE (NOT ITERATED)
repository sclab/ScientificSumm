On the other hand, if this program has a solution with  objective value > 0, then for at least one strategy σc ∈ Σc we 5 Recall that the assumption of a single opponent (that is, the assumption of two players) is without loss of generality for one-shot dominance.
If σ∗ r is strictly dominated by some mixed strategy, this linear program has a solution with objective value < 1.
As a first observation , checking whether a given strategy is strictly ( weakly ) dominated by some pure strategy is straightforward , by checking , for every pure strategy for that
