In this paper, we study some fundamental computational questions concerning dominance and iterated dominance,  including how hard it is to check whether a given strategy can be eliminated by each of the variants of these notions.
In Section 5, we study dominance and iterated dominance when the  dominating strategy can only place probability on a few pure strategies.
Computing solutions according to ( iterated ) dominance is important for at least the following reasons : 1 ) it can be computationally easier than computing ( for instance ) a Nash equilibrium ( and therefore it can be useful as a
