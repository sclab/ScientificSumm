We show that, unlike in normal form games, deciding whether a given pure strategy is dominated by another pure strategy in a Bayesian game is NP-complete (both with strict and weak dominance);  however, deciding whether a strategy is dominated by some mixed strategy can still be done in polynomial time with a single linear program solve (both with strict and weak âˆ— This material is based upon work supported by the  National Science Foundation under ITR grants IIS-0121678 and IIS-0427858, and a Sloan Fellowship.
Finally , we show that iterated dominance using pure strategies can require an exponential number of
