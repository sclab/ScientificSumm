In this definition, it is sometimes allowed for the  dominating strategy σi to be a mixed strategy, that is, a probability distribution over pure strategies.
When we are looking at the dominance relations for player i, the other players (−i) can be thought of as a single player.3  Therefore, in the rest of the paper, when we study one-shot (not iterated) dominance, we will focus without loss of generality on two-player games.4 In two-player games, we will  generally refer to the players as r (row) and c (column) rather than 1 and 2.
For example , in the following game
