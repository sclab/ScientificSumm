We show that the strategy is  dominated by a pure strategy if and only if there is a solution to the satisfiability instance.
From Claim 2, it follows that all strategies of the form σi(q) will eventually be eliminated.
Let the pure strategy to be dominated be the one that plays 0 for every type.
Specifically , to find out whether player i '' s strategy σ∗ is dominated by a strategy that places positive probability on only k pure strategies , we can simply check , for every subset of k of player i '' s pure strategies
