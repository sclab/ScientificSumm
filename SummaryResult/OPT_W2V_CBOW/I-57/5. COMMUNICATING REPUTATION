Under the probabilistic framework of the beta  distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agent"s own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.
This is commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions.
a and b ) , the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes , N , which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution , given by : N = < nab ij > âˆ€a ,
