â€¢ Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to  accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).
Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal  identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.
Once the receiving agent has updated its sets , it uses the contract outcomes within both
