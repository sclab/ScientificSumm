• Independent Beta Distributions: We use independent beta distributions to represent each contract dimension, in order to calculate ˆp(X), and then, as described earlier, we  approximate Cov(p(X)) and ignore the correlations by setting all the off-diagonal terms to zero.
For each set of  contracts, we use the approaches described above to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)), and hence, the variance in the expected contract utility, Var(E[U]).
4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section , we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts , and the standard results of
