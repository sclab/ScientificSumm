The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.
3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is  derived from an unsuccessful outcome.
Now , given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract , it should consider the expected utility that it will derive , E [ U ] , and this is given by : E [ U ] = p ( o = 1 ) u ( o
