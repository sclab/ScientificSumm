Unfortunately, their way of measuring the sensitivity does not perform equally well for short queries and prediction accuracy drops considerably when a state-of-the-art retrieval technique (like Okapi or a language modeling approach) is adopted for retrieval instead of the tf-idf weighting used in their paper [16].
In fact, most of the successful techniques are based on measuring some characteristics of the retrieved document set to estimate topic difficulty.
The superiority of WIG over other prediction techniques based on unigram features, which will be demonstrated later in our paper, coincides with that of MRF for retrieval.
Next we review some representative
