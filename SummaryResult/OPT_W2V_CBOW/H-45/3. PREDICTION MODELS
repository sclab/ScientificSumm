Assuming that the user issues query Qi âˆˆQ and the retrieval results in response to Qi is a ranked list L of documents, we calculate the amount of information contained in P(Qs,Dt) with respect to Qi and L by Eq.1 which is a variant of entropy called the weighted entropy[13].
Now we introduce our performance predictor WIG which is the weighted information gain [ 13 ] computed as the difference between ) , ( , tsLQ DQH i and ) , ( , CQH sLQi .Specifically , given query Qi , collection C and ranked list L
