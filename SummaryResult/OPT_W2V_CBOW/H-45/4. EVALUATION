We make use of all of the queries for our two baselines, that is, the clarity score and the robustness score.
In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).
We discover that our methods generalize well on TB06-adhoc while the correlation for the clarity score with retrieval performance on this data set is considerably worse.
Though not reported here , we also tried the query likelihood model
