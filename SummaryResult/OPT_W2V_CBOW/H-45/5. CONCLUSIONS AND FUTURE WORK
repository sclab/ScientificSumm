Considering the adaptability of WIG to a range of collections and query types, one of our future plans is to apply this method to predict user preference of search results on realistic data collected from a commercial search engine.
To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.
Other than accuracy, another major issue that prediction techniques have to deal with in a Web environment is efficiency.
For both types of web queries, our prediction models were shown to be substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art techniques.
We demonstrated
