Imagine that only one shared resource is known by a number of agents using one predictor forecasting the 76 The Sixth Intl.
In the case where the set of servers predicted having free resources available is not empty (line 13), the agent selects one of those for allocation.
In the case, no free resources are expected (line 9), the agent will explore resources by  allocating the task at a randomly selected server from all not predictable servers to gather resource load information.
Suppose the active predictor predicts slightly above the resource capacity which leads not to a allocation on a
