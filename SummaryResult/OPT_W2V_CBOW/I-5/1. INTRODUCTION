In this paper we propose a distributed solution of the  resource allocation problem based on self-organisation of the resource consumers in a system with limited resources.
In our approach, agents dynamically allocate tasks to servers that provide a limited amount of resources.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section gives an overview of the related work already done in the area of load balancing, resource allocation or scheduling.
We demonstrate that this mechanism performs well dynamic systems with a large number of tasks and can easily be adapted to various  system sizes.
With the increasing
