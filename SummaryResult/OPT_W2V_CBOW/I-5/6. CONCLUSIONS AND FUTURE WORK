We are aware of the long learning phase in environments with a large number of shared resources known by each agent.
A simple decision mechanism based on different beliefs of the agent creates an emergent behaviour that leads to effective resource  allocation.
In the case of a server becomes  unavailable, the agents can adapt quickly to this new situation by exploring new resources or remain at the home server if an allocation is not possible.
Our approach adapts to changes in the environment but it is not evolutionary.
In the near future we will investigate if an automatic adaptation of
