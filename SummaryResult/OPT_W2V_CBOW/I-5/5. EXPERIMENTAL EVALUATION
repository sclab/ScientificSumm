The first experiment show the  performance in a stable environment where a number of agents allocate tasks to servers that provide a constant amount of resources.
The first experiment shows our model in a stable 3-server environment that provide a total amount of 7000 resource units.
The total resource load of all shared resources is constant over the experiments, which indicates the all agents allocate their tasks to one of the shared resource (comp.
For this time the task consumes the assigned amount of server resources.
The resource consumption is assigned randomly to each task prior to its allocation from
