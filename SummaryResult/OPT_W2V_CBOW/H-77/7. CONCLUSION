In this paper, we showed that the approach can work for extraction from general documents as well.
We found that the accuracies did not drop substantially across different domains and across different languages, indicating that the models were generic.
All the above investigations were not conducted in previous work, and through our investigations we verified the generality and the significance of the title extraction approach. 
We found that the performance of the Perceptorn models was the best.
In this paper, we have investigated the problem of automatically extracting titles from general documents.
We have tried using a machine learning approach
