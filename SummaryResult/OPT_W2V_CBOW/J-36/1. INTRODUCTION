Thus even when it is easy to find Nash equilibria in each of the worlds of a Socratic game, we require new techniques to solve the Socratic game itself.
This approach contrasts with traditional game theory, in which players are usually modeled as having fixed, exogenously given  information about the structure of the game and its payoffs.
We give efficient algorithms to find Nash  equilibriai.e., tuples of strategies from which no player has unilateral incentive to deviate-in broad classes of two-player Socratic games in both models.
As in traditional game theory , the players in a Socratic game choose actions
