The results in this paper consider cases in which the  underlying worlds of a two-player Socratic game are either constant-sum games or strategically zero-sum games, a class that generalizes constant-sum games to include all games in which the sum of payoffs depends linearly on the interaction between the players.
In traditional game theory, players are typically endowed with exogenously given knowledge of the structure of the game-either full omniscient knowledge or partial but fixed information.
When the underlying worlds are  constant sum, we give polynomial-time algorithms to find Nash equilibria in both the observable- and unobservable-query models.
We imagine a
