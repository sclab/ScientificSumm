Thus the sum of  payoffs does depend on players" choice of strategies, but not on the interaction of their choices-i.e., for fixed functions gi and gii, we have ui(q, f) + uii(q, f) = gi(qi, fi) + gii(qii, fii) for all strategies q, f .
Then the following are equivalent : ( i ) G is strategically zero sum ; ( ii ) there exist labels ( i , ai ) for every player i ∈ { i , ii } and every pure strategy ai ∈ Ai such that , for all pure strategies a ∈ A ,
