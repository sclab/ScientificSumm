In the Socratic game, a pure strategy for Player i consists of a query qi ∈ Qi and a response function mapping any  result of the query qi to a strategy ai ∈ Ai to play.
After learning the results of the queries, the players select strategies a ∈ A and receive as payoffs u wreal i (a) − δi(qi).
• Qi is a set of available queries for Player i.
Formally , we will consider a mixed-strategy-function profile f = fquery , fresp to have two parts : • a function fquery i : Qi → [ 0
