Let alg be an arbitrary algorithm that finds a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in each of the derived Stage-2 games Gstage2(q), and let Galg stage1 be the derived  Stage1 game.
Define an unobservable-query  Socratic game G∗ with one possible world for each t ∈ T, one available zero-cost query qi for each Player i so that qi  reveals ti, and all else as in G. Bayesian Nash equilibria in G correspond directly to Nash equilibria in G∗ , and the worlds of G∗ are strategically zero sum.
By Lemma 5.5 , we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic
