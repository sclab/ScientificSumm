First, we observe that, by construction, the function Ë†fi  computed in Step 3 must be a best response to Player II playing fii, no matter what query Player I makes.
Verifying that this strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium requires checking that fresp i (qi, qi(w)) is a well-defined  function (from constraint VI), that fquery i and fresp i (qi, qi(w)) are probability distributions (from constraints III and IV), and that each player is playing a best response to his or her  opponent"s strategy (from constraints I and II).
Any feasible point for the LP in
