The main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following : • convert_improvements : converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done , into constraints on the next proposal to be made ; • convert_no_decrease : converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made ; • construct_proposal : constructs a new proposal according to the constraints obtained with convert_improvements , convert_no_decrease
