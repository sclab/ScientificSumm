Two topics that are very close on this graph give the same information, and therefore one of them could be discarded without changes in TREC results.
For this reason we have not attempted in this paper to point to the specific high hubness topics as being good for evaluation.
â€¢ If we use MAP as the measure of effectiveness, it is also true that the easiest topics are better at  distinguishing more or less effective systems.
Therefore, one might think that the normalizations are unuseful in this setting.
This is not surprising , since in practice the two functions are
