The analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics.
This is an initial work, and further analyses could be  performed.
More particularly, we propose Average Average Precision (AAP), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of  normalizing the average precision measure in TREC, on the basis of both MAP (Mean Average Precision) and AAP.
Our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the  topics and all the systems available.
For instance ,
