This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).
We then repeat the same normalization process (with GMAP and GAAP - Geometric AAP - replacing MAP and AAP): whereas authority values still perfectly correlate with GMAP (0.99) and GAAP (1.00), the correlation with hubness largely  disappears (values are −0.16 and −0.09 - slightly negative but not enough to concern us).
Finally , although one
