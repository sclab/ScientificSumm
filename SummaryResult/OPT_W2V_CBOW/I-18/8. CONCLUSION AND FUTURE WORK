Future works will focus on new strategies to solve new conflicts, specially those arising when relaxing the  independence assumption between the requests.
Through the tuning of the strategies (α, and λ) and their plastic interlacing within the protocol, it is  possible to coordinate agents without additional communication: the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same between informed simulations and simulations implementing strategies.
An observation satellite swarm is a cooperative  multiagent system with strong constraints in terms of  communication and computation capabilities.
Indeed , the chosen planning approach results in a combinatory explosion with big sets of requests : an
