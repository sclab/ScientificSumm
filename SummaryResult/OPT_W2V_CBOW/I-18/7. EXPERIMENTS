Isolation leading to a lower cost is due to the high  number of redundancies: many agents carry out the same  request at different costs.
We can notice that the use of 5 For instance, the rank-1-expert agent withdraws due to the altruist strategy and the cost increases by in the worst case, then rank-2-expert agent withdraws due to the altruist strategy and the cost increases by in the worst case.
For each scenario , six simulations have been performed : one with centralized planning ( all requests are planned by the ground station before the simulation ) , one where
