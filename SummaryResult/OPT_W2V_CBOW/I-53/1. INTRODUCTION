Hence, our objective is to overcome the computational complexity of finding the Shapley value for this game.
The main advantage of the Shapley value is that it provides a solution that is both unique and fair (see Section 2.1 for a discussion of the property of fairness).
Thus, our contribution lies in also in providing, for the first time, an analysis of the percentage error in the  approximate Shapley value.
Thus , many more real-life situations fit more easily into a coalitional form game , whose structure is more tractable than that of a non-cooperative game , whether that be
