It is possible for the marginal contribution of this player to be one if it joins a coalition in which the number of type 1 players is between zero and (q − 1)/w1.
In the same way, we obtain the Shapley value of the large party for the general case where ws > 1 as: ϕl = wl/ws /(m + 1) Now consider a small player.
On the other hand, if q = mj (m = |N| is the number of players), only the grand coalition is possible.
We know that the sum of the Shapley values of all the m+1 players is one
