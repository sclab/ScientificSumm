In particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game is known to be #P-complete in the general case.
For other general voting games, we overcome the problem of computational complexity by presenting a new randomized method for determining the  approximate Shapley value.
However, in this  paper, we show that there are some specific voting games for which the problem is computationally tractable.
Its main advantage is that it provides a unique and fair solution, but its main problem is that, for many coalition games, the Shapley value cannot be determined in polynomial time.
The time complexity
