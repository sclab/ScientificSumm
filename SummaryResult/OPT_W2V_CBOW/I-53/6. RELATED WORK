Our method also differs from [7] in that while [7] presents a method for the case where all the players" weights are distributed normally, our method applies to any type of distribution for these weights.
In order to overcome the computational complexity of finding the Shapley value, two main approaches have been proposed in the literature.
One approach is to use generating functions [3].
The method we propose differs from this in that they define the Shapley value by treating a player '' s number of swings ( if a player can change a losing coalition to a winning
