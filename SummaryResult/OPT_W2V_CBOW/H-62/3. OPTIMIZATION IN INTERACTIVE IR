In most cases, as we may expect, the system"s response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the  possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.
Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function , we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that , in order to choose the optimal response to at , the system should perform two tasks : ( 1
