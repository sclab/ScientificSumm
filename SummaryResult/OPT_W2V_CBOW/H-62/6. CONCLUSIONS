Unlike most previous work, we emphasize the use of  immediate search context and implicit feedback information as well as eager updating of search results to maximally benefit a user.
We further  propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately  preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.
The developed search agent thus can improve existing web search performance
