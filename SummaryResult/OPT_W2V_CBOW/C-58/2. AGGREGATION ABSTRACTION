The system associates an aggregation function ftype with each attribute type, and for each level-i subtree Ti in the  system, the system defines an aggregate value Vi,type,name for each  (at380 tributeType, attributeName) pair as follows.
Instead, if an attribute stores values as tuples (sum,count), the attribute satisfies the  hierarchical computation property while still allowing the applications to compute the average from the aggregate sum and count values.
Then the aggregate value for a level-i subtree Ti is the aggregation function for the type , ftype computed across the aggregate values of each of Ti '' s k
