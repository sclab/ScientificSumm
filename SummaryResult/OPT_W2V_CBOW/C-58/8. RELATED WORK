Some of these systems internally make use of the reduction forest not only for routing but also for caching [32], but for simplicity, these systems do not  generally export this powerful functionality in their external interface.
All these systems implicitly perform aggregation on some attribute, and each one of them must be designed to handle any reconfigurations in the underlying DHT.
Our goal is to develop and expose the internal reduction forest of DHTs as a similarly general and useful abstraction.
Although this strategy guarantees path convergence , it loses the aggregation tree abstraction property of DHTs as the domain
