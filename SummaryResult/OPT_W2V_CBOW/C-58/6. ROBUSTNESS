By reducing the number of nodes that have to be accessed to answer a probe, applications can reduce the  probability of incorrect results occurring due to the failure of nodes that do not contribute to the aggregate.
Probes for the file location can then be answered without accessing the root; hence they are not affected by the failure of the root.
In our system, however, all internal nodes have to be replicated along with the root.
