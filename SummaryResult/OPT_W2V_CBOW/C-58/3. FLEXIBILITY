The probe interface not only allows applications to obtain the aggregated value for a specified tree but also allows a probing node to continuously fetch the values for a specified time, thus  enabling an application to adapt to spatial and temporal heterogeneity.
In our implementation we choose to return results at all levels k < l for a level-l probe because ( i ) it is inexpensive as the nodes traversed for level-l probe also contain level k aggregates for k < l and as we expect the network cost of transmitting the additional information to be small for the
