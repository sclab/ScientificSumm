To serve as a basic building block, a SDIMS should have four properties: scalability to many nodes and attributes, flexibility to accommodate a broad range of applications, administrative  isolation for security and availability, and robustness to node and  network failures.
We present a Scalable Distributed Information Management  System (SDIMS) that aggregates information about large-scale  networked systems and that can serve as a basic building block for a broad range of large-scale distributed applications by providing  detailed views of nearby information and summary views of global  information.
We design , implement and evaluate a SDIMS that ( 1 ) leverages Distributed
