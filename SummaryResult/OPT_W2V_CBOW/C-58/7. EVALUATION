Observe that at some constant number of attributes, as the number of nodes increase in the system, the maximum node stress increases in the gossiping approach, while it decreases in our approach as the load of  aggregation is spread across more nodes.
Overall , our initial experience with using SDIMS for the PRACTII replication system suggests that ( 1 ) the general aggregation interface provided by SDIMS simplifies the construction of distributed applications-given the low-level PRACTI mechanisms , 388 we were able to construct a basic file system that uses SDIMS for several distinct control tasks in under two weeks
