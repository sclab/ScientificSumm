A SDIMS should adapt to reconfigurations in a timely fashion and should also provide mechanisms so that applications can tradeoff the cost of adaptation with the consistency level in the aggregated results when reconfigurations occur.
It is interesting to note that although these systems export a global hash table abstraction, many of them internally make use of what can be viewed as a scalable system of aggregation trees to, for example, route a request for a given key to the right DHT node.
However , meeting the SDIMS requirements forces a design to address four questions : ( 1 )
