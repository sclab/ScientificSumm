Finally, an other interesting question is to assess whether the structural decomposition techniques discussed in the  paper can be used to efficiently deal with generalizations of the winner determination problem.
In particular, this Award  allowed Gottlob to invite G. Greco for a research visit to  Oxford.
In the light of this observation, we note that proving some  approximability results for structured item graphs requires a deep understanding of the approximability of query  decompositions, which is currently missing in the literature.
For some special, yet relevant cases, a highly parallelizable algorithm is also discussed.
Interestingly , it also emerged that the
