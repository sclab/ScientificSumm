In fact, given the uniqueness of these vertices  selected for ensuring the connectivity, a one-to-one  correspondence can be established between the existence of a Hamiltonian path for G and the vertices of the form w(x,y).
Connectedness between blocks , and uniqueness of the connections : The second crucial observation is that in the path connecting a vertex of the form bs ( x ) ( resp. , bt ( y ) ) with a vertex of the form ns ( x , e ) ( resp. , nt ( y , e ) ) there is one special
