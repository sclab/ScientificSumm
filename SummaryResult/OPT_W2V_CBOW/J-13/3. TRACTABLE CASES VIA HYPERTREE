Then,  procedure TopDown is used to extend h∗ to all the other partial packings for vertices of T. In particular, at each vertex v, h∗ is extended with the packing hhv,c, for each child c of v. Example 5.
Then, the result follows, since in the top-down phase, the packing hr giving the maximum weight over χ(Tr) = E(H) is first included in h∗ , and then extended at each node c with the packing hhv,c conformingly with hv and such that the maximum value of v hv is achieved.
Intuitively , v hv stores the weight of
