Currently, the most general class of tractable combinatorial auctions has been singled out by modelling interactions among bidders with the notion of item graph, which is a graph whose nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any 152 Figure 1: Example MaxWSP problem: (a) Hypergraph H I0,B0 , and a packing h for it; (b) Primal graph for H I0,B0 ; and, (c,d) Two item graphs for H I0,B0 .
Note that a key issue of the tractability is to consider the hypertree width of the dual hypergraph Â¯H instead of the auction
