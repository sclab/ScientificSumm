While this problem is in general  NPhard, it is known to be feasible in polynomial time on those instances whose associated item graphs have bounded treewidth (called structured item graphs).
Even more surprisingly, we show that the class of tractable instances identified by means of our approach properly  contains the class of instances having a structured item graph.
In fact, the tractability of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed treewidth exists (and if so, computing one) was left as a crucial open problem.
In this paper , we solve this problem by proving that the existence of
