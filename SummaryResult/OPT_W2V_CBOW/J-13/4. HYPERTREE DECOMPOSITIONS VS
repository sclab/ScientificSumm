Note that, as far as the maximum weighted-set packing problem is concerned, given a hypergraph H, we can always assume that for each node v ∈ N(H), {v} is in E(H).
Then, a k-width tree  decomposition of an item graph for H exists if and only if ¯H has a (k + 1)-width strict hypertree decomposition2 .
Therefore , letting C ( shw , k ) denote the class of all the hypergraphs whose dual hypergraphs ( associated with maximum 2 The term +1 only plays the technical role of taking care of the different definition of width for
