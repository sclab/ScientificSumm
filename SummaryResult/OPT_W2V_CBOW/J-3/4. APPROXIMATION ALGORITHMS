To calculate the spend of this strategy consider two cases: if u = 0 then we are bidding h(v) with probability pv = α/v.
By Lemma 1 there is always a two-bid optimal uniform bidding strategy and so we may assume that the strategy achieving α clicks randomizes over two bids.
The click-price curve says that if we bid h(r ) on every keyword (and therefore every query), we get at least r traffic, since this bid would ensure that for all q such that b∗ q ≤ h(r ) we win as many clicks as Ω.
For any C ,
