For any possible bid b, if we use the aggregate landscape just as we would a regular landscape, we exactly represent the cost and clicks associated with making that bid  simultaneously on all queries associated with the aggregate  landscape.
Define a two-bid strategy to be a uniform strategy which puts non-zero weight on at most two bid vectors.
Given an instance of Budget Optimization in which there are a total of N points in all the landscapes, we can find the best uniform strategy in O(N log N) time.
Third , any algorithm that gives an approximation guarantee will
