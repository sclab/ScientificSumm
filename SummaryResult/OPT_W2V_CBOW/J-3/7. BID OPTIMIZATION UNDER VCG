We claim that in the VCG auction, the landscapes are  convex.
But, the equation above shows that each piece has its  incremental cpc equal to the bid that achieves it; thus in the case of VCG the pieces are also sorted by bid.
For the sake of the budget optimization problem we can define VCG by just redefining costq(b) (replacing Equation (2)): costq(b) = p−1 X j=i (α[j] − α[j + 1]) · b[j] where i = pos(b).
Observation 1 still holds , and we can construct a landscape as before , where each landscape point corresponds
