We can solve this problem by showing that given any laminar ordering, there is an equivalent one in which each keyword has at most 2 children.
In this case we say that j is a child of i.
Furthermore, G has at most twice as many nodes as G. Given a graph with at most two children per node, we  define F[i, b, U] to be the maximum number of clicks achievable by bidding at least b on each of keywords j s.t.
We call a solution deterministic if it consists of one bid vector , rather than a
