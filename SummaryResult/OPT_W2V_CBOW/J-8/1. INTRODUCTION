From a computational game theory point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior.
As far as we know, we are the first to provide a topological characterization for equilibrium existence in multi-commodity and single-source network games.
For the case of a single source and multiple sinks ( for example , in a multicast tree ) , we show that in a fair connection game there is a strong equilibrium if the underlying graph is
