An extension parallel graph (EPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 â†’e G2, where G1 and G2 are 5 We limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti and payment only on those edges.
More formally , the cost function of each player on an edge e , in a joint action S , is fe ( ne ( S ) ) = ce ne ( S ) , where ne ( S ) is the number of
