Let S be a SE in Λ1 that minimizes the cost of players in T2 (such a SE exists by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.2).
S1 = {a, b, c}, 7 In any NE of the game, player 1 will buy the edge e and player 2 will buy the edge f. This is since the alternate path, in the respective part, will cost the player 2.5.
By Theorem 3.7, it holds that for each game Λj, j = 1, .
Let Λ be a fair connection game on the graph G. We denote by Λ ( Γ ) the game played
