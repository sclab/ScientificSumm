Therefore, we further construct a  sub-domain model more related to the given query, by using a subset of in-domain documents that are related to the query.
MODELS As in previous studies, we exploit a set of documents already classified in each domain.
The score depending on the domain model is then as follows: ∑∈ = Vt D Dom QDom tPtPDQScore )|(log)|(),( θθ (8) Although the above equation requires using all the terms in the vocabulary, in practice, only the strongest terms in the domain model are useful and the terms with low probabilities are often noise.
