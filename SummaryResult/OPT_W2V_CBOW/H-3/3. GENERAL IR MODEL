In these cases, we construct two models for the query: the initial query model containing only the original terms, and a new model containing the added terms.
Here we can see that our strategy of enhancing the query model by contextual factors is equivalent to document re-ranking, which is used in [5][15][30].
In this paper, F Qθ is extracted using the 20 blind feedback documents.
Let us use 0 Qθ to denote the original query model , F Qθ for the feedback model created from feedback documents , Dom Qθ for a domain model and K Qθ for
