We point out here that the goal of this paper is not to design a better allocation rule for a  problem, but to design an algorithm to compute the payments efficiently when O is given.
In this paper, we have studied how to design a truthful  mechanism M = (O, P) for a given allocation rule O for a binary demand game.
We then formulate a general framework for designing payment P such that the mechanism M = (O, P) is truthful and computable in polynomial time.
Towards this research direction , Theorem 4 can be extended to a general allocation rule
