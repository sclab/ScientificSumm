Thus, for an agent i, we first focus on the output of one round r. In round r, if i is  selected by Algorithm 7, then it has the minimum ratio ci |Si−Tr| among all remaining agents.
Find the cut value: To calculate the cut value for agent i with fixed cost vector c−i, we follow the steps in Algorithm 4.
Remember the updating rule only updates the game setting but not the cost of the agent , thus we have gr ( x ) = x ≥ r for 1 ≤ r ≤ t. Therefore , the final cut
