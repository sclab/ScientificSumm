This theorem implies that there is a cut value for the compound output O ◦ F. We then discuss how to find the cut value for this output.
From Equation (2), the fact that index k is not selected by allocation rule O and the  definition of SMP, we have Oj(F(c )) = 1, Thus, agent i is selected by O ◦ F because of Oj(F(c )) = 1 and ψj i (c ) = 1.
An agent i is selected if and only if there is a j such that ( 1 ) i is selected in ψj ( c )
