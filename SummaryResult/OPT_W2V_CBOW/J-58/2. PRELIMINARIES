In addition, the binary demand game studied here is different from the traditional packing IP"s: we only require that the allocation to each agent is binary and the  allocation rule satisfies a certain monotonicity property; we do not put any restrictions on the objective function.
Thus, throughout his paper, we only consider these direct-revelation mechanisms in which every agent only needs to reveal its valuation vi = v(ti, 1).
Throughout this paper , unless explicitly mentioned otherwise , the setting S of the game is fixed and we are only interested in how to design P for a
