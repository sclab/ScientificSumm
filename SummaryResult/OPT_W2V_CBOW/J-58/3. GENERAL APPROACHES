Thus, its utility is κi(O, c−i) − ci > 0, which implies that the payment scheme satisfies the IR.
For any strategy-proof mechanism for a binary demand game G with setting S, if we fix the cost c−i of all agents other than i, the payment to agent i is a constant p1 i if Oi(c) = 1, and it is another constant p0 i if Oi(c) = 0.
This theorem implies that for the binary demand games we can always normalize the payment to an agent i such that the payment to the agent is 0 when it is
