Also, commitments have played a  significant role in the theory of equilibrium selection (see, e.g., [13].
Leadership games, as mentioned in the introduction, analyze commitments to pure or mixed  strategies in what is essentially a two-player setting [15, 16].
Commitments have by no means gone unnoticed (see, ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ (1, 3) (3, 2) (0, 0) (2, 1) ⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ Figure 1: Committing to a dominated strategy can be  advantageous.
Thus, Conitzer and Sandholm [2] have studied the computational complexity of computing the optimal strategy to commit to in normal form and Bayesian games.
The possibility to make commitments distinguishes cooperative
