In this example the strategic position of Mat is so weak if he is to  commit first, that even the possibility to commit inductively does not strengthen it, whereas, in a similar fashion as with conditional  commitments, Row can enforce a payoff of two to both himself and Mat if he is the first to commit.
Neither is it in general advantageous to commit first to a mixed strategy in a three-player game.
As can readily be observed, in any game, the inductive  commitments of the first two players to commit coincide with their conditional commitments.
Using pure conditional commitments
