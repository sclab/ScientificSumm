In our framework, a counterargument  consists of a justified prediction Aj, P, S , D generated by an agent Aj with the intention to rebut an argument α generated by another agent Ai, that endorses a solution class S different from that of α.S for the problem at hand and justifies this with a justification D .
By exchanging arguments and counterarguments (including  counterexamples), agents can argue about the correct solution of a given problem, i.e.
Using this information, we can define three types of arguments: justified predictions,  counterarguments, and counterexamples.
Thus a counterexample is also a counterargument , one that states
