Specifically, to assess the confidence of a justified prediction α, an agent obtains the set of cases in its individual case base that are subsumed by α.D.
Figure 2 illustrates the individual evaluation of the confidence of an argument , in particular , three endorsing cases and one counterexample are found in the case base of agents Ai , giving an estimated confidence of 0.6 Moreover , we can also define the joint confidence of an argument α as the confidence computed using the cases present in the case bases of all the agents in the group : C (
