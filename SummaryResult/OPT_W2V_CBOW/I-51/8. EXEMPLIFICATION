A3 comes up with the justified prediction α1 3 = A3, P, hadromerida, D4 , and broadcasts it to the rest of the agents with the message assert(α1 3).
The counterargument is sent to A3 with the message rebut(β1 2 , α1 3).
In particular, in this example: • α0 1 = A1, P, hadromerida, D1 • α0 2 = A2, P, astrophorida, D2 • α0 3 = A3, P, axinellida, D3 A1 starts owning the token and tries to generate  counterarguments for α0 2 and α0 3, but does not succeed, however it has one counterexample c13 for α0 3.
A3 generates a
