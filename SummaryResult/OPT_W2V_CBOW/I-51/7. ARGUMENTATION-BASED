• If Ai cannot generate any counterargument or  counterexample, the token is sent to the next agent, a new round t + 1 starts, and the protocol moves to state 2.
Specifically, each agent is allowed to send one  counterargument or counterexample each time he gets the token (notice that this restriction is just to simplify the protocol, and that it does not restrict the number of counterargument an agent can sent, since they can be delayed for subsequent rounds).
• If βt i is a counterargument , then , Ai locally compares αt i with βt i by assessing
