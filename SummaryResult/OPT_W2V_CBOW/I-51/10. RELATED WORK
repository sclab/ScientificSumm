In our framework we have addressed both argument selection and preference relations using a case-based approach. 
Concerning CBR in a multi-agent setting, the first research was on negotiated case retrieval [11] among groups of agents.

Although argument selection is a key aspect of automated argumentation ( see [ 12 ] and [ 13 ] ) , most research
