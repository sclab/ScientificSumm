Specifically, we have presented AMAL, a framework that allows a group of learning agents to  argue about the solution of a given problem and we have shown how the learning capabilities can be used to generate arguments and counterarguments.
The main contributions of this work are: a) an argumentation framework for learning agents; b) a case-based preference relation over arguments, based on computing an overall confidence  estimation of arguments; c) a case-based policy to generate  counterarguments and select counterexamples; and d) an argumentation-based approach for learning from communication.
Finally , in the experiments presented here a learning agent would retain
