In particular, Figure 3 shows how when an agent receives a new problem to solve (in this case, a new sponge to determine its order), the agent uses LID to generate an argument (consisting on a justified prediction) using the cases in the case base of the agent.
In this way, the justification provided by LID will always be subsumed by α.D, and thus the resulting counterargument will be more specific than α.
Moreover , one may think that it would be better that the agents generate counterarguments based on the joint confidence preference relation ; however it is not
