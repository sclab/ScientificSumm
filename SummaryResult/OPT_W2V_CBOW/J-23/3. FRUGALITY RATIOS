The resulting change in payments can be seen as the price of co-operation and corresponds to replacing condition (1) with the following weaker condition (1∗ ): be ≥ 0 for all e ∈ E. (1∗ ) By considering all possible combinations of these modifications, we obtain four different payment bounds, namely • TUmin(c, S), which is the solution to the optimisation  problem Minimise B subject to (1∗ ), (2), and (3).
For the payment bounds that are derived from  maximisation problems, (i.e., TUmax(c, S) and NTUmax(c, S)),  constraints of type (3) are redundant and can be dropped.
On the other
