We study the relationships between the different payment bounds, both for  general set systems and for specific set-system auctions, such as path auctions and vertex-cover auctions.
We show that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible worst-case bound; this is the first auction for this problem to have these properties.
Also , we consider two natural modifications of the definition of Karlin et al. , and we analyse the properties of the resulting payment bounds , such as monotonicity , computational hardness , and
