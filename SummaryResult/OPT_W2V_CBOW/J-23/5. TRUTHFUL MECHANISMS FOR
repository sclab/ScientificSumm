Let b be the corresponding bid vector and let c be a new cost vector with cv = bv for v ∈ S and cv = cv for v ∈ S. Condition (2) guarantees that S is an optimal solution to the cost vector c .
Suppose for contradiction that c is a cost vector with minimum-cost vertex cover S and NTUmin(c, S) < c(V \S).
Therefore, for the rest of the proof we assume that c(S) < c(V \ S).
Hence , we have NTUmax ( c , S ) = P v∈S bv = NTUmin ( c , S )
