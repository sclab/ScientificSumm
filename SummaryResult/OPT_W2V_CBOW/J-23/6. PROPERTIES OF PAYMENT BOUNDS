For any such P, one can construct a set system S and a vector of costs c such that NTUmin(c) is the optimal solution to P. PROOF.
6.4.2 NP-Hardness Another problem with NTUmin(c, S) is that it is NP-hard to compute even if the number of feasible sets is polynomial in n. Again, this puts it at a disadvantage compared to NTUmax(c, S) and TUmax(c, S) (see Remark 1).
To show that Ï†TUmin(VCG) is at most 1, one must prove that the VCG payment is at most TUmin(c).
