While our main result about vertex cover auctions (Theorem 4) is with respect to NTUmin = Î½, we make use of the new definitions by first comparing the payment of our mechanism to a weaker bound NTUmax, and then  bootstrapping from this result to obtain the desired bound.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first auction for this problem that enjoys these  properties.
They show that, for a large class of truthful mechanisms for this problem, the frugality ratio is as large as the number of edges in the shortest path.
This means that the solution quality of
