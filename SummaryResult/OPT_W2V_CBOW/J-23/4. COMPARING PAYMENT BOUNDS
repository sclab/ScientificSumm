For any n ≥ 3, we can construct an instance of the vertex cover problem on a graph of size n that satisfies NTUmin(c)/TUmin(c) ≥ n − 2. j+2ix ij P \ P ij+2P \ P yijixix j j+1 i j+2ij+1 y y i i j+2ie j e j+1 e ij+1 P \ P Figure 3: Proof of Theorem 3: constraints for ˆPij and ˆPij+2 do not overlap 4.4 Upper bounds It turns out that the lower bound proved in the previous  subsection is almost tight.
Then there is a cost vector c such that S is a cheapest feasible
