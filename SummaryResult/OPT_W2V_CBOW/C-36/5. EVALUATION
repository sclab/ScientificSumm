The difference can be explained partially by the encrypted events being larger in size, because they include both the plaintext and the encrypted content in this test.
The throughput when using attribute encryption with an event type with one attribute is 46% of the throughput achieved when events are sent in plaintext.
This test was designed to show that the use of the encrypted event content mechanism  between two authorised brokers incurs only a small  performance overhead.
The difference in performance with event encryption and attribute encryption with only one attribute is caused by the Java object serialisation mechanism :
