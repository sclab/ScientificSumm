In addition to providing attribute-level access control, attribute encryption enables partially authorised brokers to implement  contentbased routing based on the attributes that are accessible to them.
Attribute level encryption can be implemented in order to enforce fine-grained access control policies.
Our experiments show that i) by caching plaintext and  ciphertext content when possible, we are able to deliver  comparable performance to plaintext events, and ii) that  attribute encryption within an event incurs far less overhead than defining separate event types for the attributes that need different levels of protection.
This is particularly appropriate if broker-to-broker connections are secured by default
