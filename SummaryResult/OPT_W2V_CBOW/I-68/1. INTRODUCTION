In this context, we present VFP (= Value Function P ropagation), an efficient solution technique for the DEC-MDP model with  temporal constraints and uncertain method execution durations, that builds on the success of OC-DEC-MDP.
Finally, in section 7 we demonstrate empirically the impact of our two orthogonal improvements, i.e., we show that: (i) The new  heuristics correct the opportunity cost overestimation problem leading to higher quality policies, and (ii) By allowing for a systematic  tradeoff of solution quality for time, the VFP algorithm runs much faster than the OC-DEC-MDP algorithm
