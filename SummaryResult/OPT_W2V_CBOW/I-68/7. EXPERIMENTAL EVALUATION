We decided to test the runtime of the VFP algorithm running with three different levels of accuracy, i.e., different approximation  parameters P and V were chosen, such that the cumulative error of the solution found by VFP stayed within 1%, 5% and 10% of the solution found by the OC- DEC-MDP algorithm.
We show the results in Figure (7c) where, especially for larger meshes, the VFP algorithm runs up to one  order of magnitude faster than OC-DEC-MDP while finding a policy that is within less than 1% from the policy found by OC-  DECMDP. 
Since the VFP algorithm that we
