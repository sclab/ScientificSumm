This double dependency results from the fact, that the expected reward for starting the execution of method mj at time t also depends on the probability that method mj will be enabled by time t. Consequently, if time is discretized, one needs to consider Δ|M| candidate policies in order to find π∗ .
Second, while OC-DEC-MDP emphasizes on precise calculation of values Vj,[τ,τ ], it fails to address a critical issue that determines how the values Vj,[τ,τ ] are split given that the method mj has  multiple enabling methods.
While such state representation is beneficial , in that the
