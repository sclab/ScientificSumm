When the VFP algorithm propagates the value functions and  probability functions, it constantly carries out operations represented by equations (1) and (3) and we have already shown that these  operations are convolutions of some functions p(t) and h(t).
Probability Function , denoted as Pi ( t ) , that maps time t ∈ [ 0 , Δ ] to the probability that method mi will be completed before time t. Such functional representation allows us to easily read the current policy , i.e. , if an agent Ak is at method mi at time t , then it
