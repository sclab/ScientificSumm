For heuristic bH 1,1 , the opportunity cost function Vj0 is by  definition split in such manner, that PK k=0 Vik (t) â‰¤ Vj0 (t).
If m0 is the only methods that precedes method mk, then V ik,0 = Vik is propagated to method m0, and consequently the opportunity cost for completing the method m0 at time t is equal to PK k=0 Vik,0(t).
So far , we have taken the same approach as in [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] in that the opportunity cost function Vj0 , ik that the method mik sends back to the method mj0
