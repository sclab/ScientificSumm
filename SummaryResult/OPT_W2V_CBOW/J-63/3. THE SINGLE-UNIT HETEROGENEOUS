Similarly since j is allocated Ai in ˆT∗ , we have that using the allocation of ˆT∗ according to the true valuation gives an  allocation of value U satisfying ˆV ∗ − ˆvj(i)+vj(i) ≤ U ≤ V ∗ , which together with the previous inequality completes the proof.
If we  removed from the optimal allocation T ∗ the contribution of the buyer j - seller i pair, we are left with an allocation which excludes j, and has value V ∗ − (vj(i) − ci).
Consider a buyer j who is matched with seller i according to his true
