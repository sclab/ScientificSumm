We measure this by the percentage of queries that are actually stemmed, over all the queries that could possibly be stemmed.
Since we only care how much we can improve the naive model, we will only use these 408 queries (all the queries that are affected by the naive stemming model) in the experiments.
By predicting which word variants are going to be useful, we can dramatically reduce the  number of stemmed words, thus improving both the recall and the precision.
Document context sensitive stemming gives a significant lift to the performance , from 2.7 % to 4.2 % for
