Using word  pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29% of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG5) by 6.1% on these queries and 1.8% over all query traffic.
We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine.
Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants.
Traditionally , stemming has been applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming
