Whereas our framework seeks to minimize the difference between the global and local PageRank, the  objective used in [6] is to crawl the most highly (globally) ranked pages first.
Using their algorithm for our problem would require that either the entire global domain first be downloaded or a connectivity server be used, both of which would lead to very large web graphs. 
Many algorithmic improvements for computing exact  PageRank values have been proposed [9, 10, 14].
This is in contrast to our method, which  approximates the global PageRank and scales linearly with the size of the local domain.
Their approach
