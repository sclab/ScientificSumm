The problem with the latter method is in the choice of the ( + 1) length starting vector, ν. Consequently, the PageRank estimate given by the simple method differs from the true PageRank by at least 2αxj, where xj is the  PageRank of page j.
The L1NormDiff method is called on the components of these vectors which correspond to the pages in L, and it estimates the value of EL(y + (˜uT j f)z) 1 for each page j.
If fj is computed exactly for each global page j , then the PageRank algorithm would need to be run for each
