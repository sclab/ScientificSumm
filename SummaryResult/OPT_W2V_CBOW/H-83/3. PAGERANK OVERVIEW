In each step of the random walk, the ‘surfer" either follows an outlink from the current page (i.e.
This method first chooses a random starting vector r(0) , and iteratively multiplies the current vector by the PageRank matrix PU ; see Algorithm 1.
[3], is to replace each zero column of U by a non-negative, L1-normalized vector.
We define the PageRank matrix PU to be : PU = αUD−1 U + ( 1 − α ) veT , ( 1 ) where DU is the ( unique ) diagonal matrix such that UD−1 U is column stochastic , α is
