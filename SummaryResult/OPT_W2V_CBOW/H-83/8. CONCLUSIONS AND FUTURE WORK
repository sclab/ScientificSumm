The results of such a study can then be analyzed to determine the added benefit of using the global PageRanks computed by our methods, over just using the local PageRanks.
In this work, we contend that the use of global PageRank in a localized search engine can improve performance.
One way to integrate these pages into our framework is to start the FindGlobalPR algorithm with the current subgraph F equal to the set of pages that were crawled by the focused crawler.
We conclude that by crawling an additional n or 2n pages , our methods find an estimate of
