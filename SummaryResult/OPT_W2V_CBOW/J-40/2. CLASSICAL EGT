Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the  population [17].
The strategy s is an ESS if the expected fitness of an  organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t, for all t = s and all sufficiently small .
A strategy s is an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ESS ) for the 2-player , symmetric game given by fitness function F , if for every strategy t = s , there exists an t such that for all 0 < <
