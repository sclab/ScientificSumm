In this paper, we introduce and examine a natural  extension of classical evolutionary game theory (EGT) to a setting in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network.
We generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ) to networks , and show a pair of complementary results that exhibit the power of randomization in our setting : subject to degree or edge density conditions , the classical ESS of any game are preserved when the graph is chosen randomly and the mutation set is chosen adversarially , or when the graph
