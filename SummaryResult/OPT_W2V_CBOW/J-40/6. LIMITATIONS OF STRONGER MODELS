Theorem 5.3 stated that if s is a classical ESS, then for graphs where |En| ≥ n1+γ , for some γ > 0, and where each organism is labeled a mutant with probability , one edge must contract.
Similarly, in the proof of Theorem 6.2, observe that the only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself, which has fitness F(t|s).
If we assume that we adopt this notion of contraction for individual mutants , and require that all incumbent-mutant edges contract , we will next show that Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 still hold , and thus it is still impossible
