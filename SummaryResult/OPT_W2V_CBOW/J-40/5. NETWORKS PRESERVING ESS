By arguments similar to those following the proof of  Theorem 5.1, if we let G = {Kn}∞ n=0, each incumbent will have the same fitness and each mutant will have the same fitness.
The following theorem relaxes this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have n1+γ edges, for some constant γ > 0, in which case it shows there will alway be at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.
Then via a standard Chernoff bound argument , one can show that with high probability , the fraction of mutants neighboring i and the fraction of mutants
