One challenge is how to provide efficient access to shared  finegrained objects in the collaborative group without imposing performance overhead on the entire caching system.
The other challenge is to support fine-grain cache coherence in the presence of slow and failed nodes.
The performance problem facing the collaborative application is coordinating with the servers consistent access to shared objects.
With BuddyCache, a group of close-by collaborating clients, connected to storage repository via a high-latency link, can avoid interactions with the server if needed objects, updates or coherency information are available in some client in the group.
