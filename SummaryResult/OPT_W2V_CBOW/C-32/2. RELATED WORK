In contrast, BuddyCache uses application level multicast and a sender-reliable  coherence protocol to provide similar access latency  improvements for transactional objects.
Multiprocessor systems and distributed shared memory systems [14, 4, 17, 18, 5] use fine-grain coherence techniques to avoid the performance penalty of false sharing but do not address issues of availability when nodes fail.
[11, 15])  investigate issues of maintaining a directory of objects cached in nearby proxy caches in wide-area environment, using  distributed directory protocols for tracking cache changes.
This multicast transport level solution is geared to the single writer semantics of web objects.
These techniques use the
