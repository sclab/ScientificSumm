This argument can be extended to show that once agents start taking different paths through the FSM all actions taken until the point where they converge on a single state must be monotonic, and hence it is always possible to converge (because actions aren"t disabled), so the interaction is error free; and the resulting state once convergence occurs is the same (because monotonic actions commute).
The essence of the proof is to argue that as long as agents haven '' t yet converged to the same state , all actions must be monotonic , and hence that these
