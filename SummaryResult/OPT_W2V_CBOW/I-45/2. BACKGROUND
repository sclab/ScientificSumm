One way of visualising the interactions that are  possible with a given commitment machine is to generate the finite state machine corresponding to the CM.
An interaction is defined by specifying the entities involved, the possible contents of the interaction state (both fluents and  commitments), and (most importantly) the actions that each entity can  perform along with the preconditions and effects of each action,  specified as add and delete lists.
We define a basic configuration S = Q , N , B , P where Q is a ( global ) message queue ( modelled as a sequence5 where messages
