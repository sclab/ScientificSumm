By carrying out a hierarchic relationship between the several chosen analysers for an environment, the sensor resource is not overloaded with the task to send the data to all the analysers.
The complexity levels allow the distribution of the processing between several resources inside the same scope.
With this, the analysis of the data is made by two resources.
Second, there is a great diversity of data aggregation techniques, data correlation and analysis, and intrusion response that can be applied to the same environment; these techniques can be organized under several levels of complexity. 
If it is necessary to add
