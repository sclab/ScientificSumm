The integration of heterogeneous IDSs to increase the variety of intrusion detection techniques in the environment is mentioned as future work [13] DIDSoG thus aims at integrating heterogeneous IDSs [13].
In contrast, DIDSoG uses the Grid to compose a DIDS by integrating specific IDSs; the resulting DIDS could however be used to identify attacks in a Grid environment.
However, the possibility of applying heterogeneous detection systems is left for future work Another DIDS for Grids is presented by Choon and Samsudim [2].
[ 6 ] and [ 7 ] propose the use of Globus Toolkit for intrusion detection , especially
