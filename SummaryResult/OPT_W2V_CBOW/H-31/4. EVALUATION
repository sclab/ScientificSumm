Clearly, using K-Mixture to model the background model outperforms the single  Poisson background model in most cases, especially for verbose queries where the improvement is statistically significant.
With term dependent coefficients, the performance of the Jelinek-Mercer Poisson model is improved in most cases.
Experiment results show that the Poisson model with  perterm smoothing outperforms multinomial model, and the performance can be further improved with two-stage  smoothing.
We then use a simple Laplace method to slightly smooth the document model  before it goes into the EM iterations.
