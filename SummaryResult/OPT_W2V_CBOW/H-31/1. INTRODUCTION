We find that while with some  smoothing methods, the new model and the multinomial model lead to exactly the same formula, with some other  smoothing methods they diverge, and the Poisson model brings in more flexibility for smoothing.
In some sense, the Poisson model combines the advantage of multinomial in modeling term frequency and the advantage of the multivariate Bernoulli in accommodating per-term smoothing.
Compared with multivariate Bernoulli , multinomial distribution has the advantage of being able to model the frequency of terms in the query ; in contrast , multivariate Bernoulli only models the presence and absence of query
