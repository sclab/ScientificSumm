It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques.
The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by  Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment.
Through  simulations of color assignment (not connectivity) we are able to investigate the influence that the size of the coloring space has on the accuracy of localization.
To estimate the accuracy of our simple model , we plot the number of radio links that
