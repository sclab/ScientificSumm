The Central device of the StarDust system consists of the following: the Light Emitter - we used a  common-off-theshelf flash light (QBeam, 3 million candlepower); the  image acquisition was done with a 3 megapixel digital camera (Sony DSC-S50) which provided the input to the Image  Processing algorithm, implemented in Matlab.
We had 5 colors available, in addition to the standard CCR, which reflects all the  incoming light (white CCR).
For our performance evaluation we implemented a version of the StarDust framework, namely the one proposed in Section 3.3.5, where the constraints are based on color and connectivity.
