To address these challenges, we propose a framework for WSN localization, called StarDust, in which the  complexity associated with the node localization is completely  removed from the sensor node.
We investigate the range of a system built on our framework by considering realities of physical phenomena that occurs during light propagation through the atmosphere.
Through image processing techniques, the locations of the retro-reflectors (i.e., sensor nodes) is  deter57 mined.
Ultrasound has a short range and is highly directional.
The main contributions of our work are the following.
We evaluate the performance of a localization system for which we obtain location
