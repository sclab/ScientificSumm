We evaluate the performance of a localization system based on our framework by localizing a network of 26  sensor nodes deployed in a 120 Ã— 60 ft2 area.
An image processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes.
The problem of localization in wireless sensor networks where nodes do not use ranging hardware, remains a  challenging problem, when considering the required location  accuracy, energy expenditure and the duration of the  localization phase.
In the StarDust framework, sensor nodes are equipped with optical retro-reflectors.
We propose and develop localization techniques based on four types of constraints : node
