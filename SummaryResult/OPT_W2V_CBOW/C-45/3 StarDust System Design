As shown in Figure 5, the spatial-based relaxation is a recursive process to assign the probability that a nodes has a certain label by using the distances between the location of a node with  multiple label locations.
The support for the label λk of sensor node ni , resulting from the interaction ( i.e. , within radio range ) with sensor node nj is given by : Qs ni ( λk ) = M ∑ m=1 gλkλm Ps nj ( λm ) ( 6 ) As a result , the localization algorithm ( Algorithm 3 consists of the following steps
