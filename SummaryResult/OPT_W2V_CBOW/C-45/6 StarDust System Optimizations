6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in  extremely rugged environments.
The hope, and our  original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.
To demonstrate the power that can be obtained by combining them, we proposed and evaluated one  combination of such primitives: color and connectivity.
It would be interesting to associate with a node , more than one label ( implicitly more than one location ) and defer the label
