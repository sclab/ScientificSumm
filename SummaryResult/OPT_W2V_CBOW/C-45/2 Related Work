To address these  challenges, and others (hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small range, localization time), several range-free localization schemes have been proposed.
A mobile node is  located by the best match, in the signal strength space, with a previously acquired signature.
The ToF localization technique that is most widely used is the GPS.
Many of the above localization solutions target specific sets of requirements and are useful for specific applications.
From the  spatiotemporal knowledge for the created events and the temporal information provided by sensor nodes, nodes" spatial  information can be obtained.
