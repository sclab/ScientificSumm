To test whether this  difference is statistically significant, we shuï¬„e predictions from two methods, randomly label half of predictions as NF and the other half as Log-All-u, and compute the difference of mean absolute error of the newly formed NF and Log-All-u data.
The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction  accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts.
Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and  LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance  measures across all 210 games.
When there are more than 500
