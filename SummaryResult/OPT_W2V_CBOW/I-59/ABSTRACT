We have developed an approach for privacy-preserving Recommender Systems based on Multi-Agent System  technology which enables applications to generate  recommendations via various filtering techniques while preserving the privacy of all participants.
The ability to preserve the privacy of all participants is an  essential requirement of the underlying Information Filtering architectures, because the deployed Recommender Systems have to be accepted by privacy-aware users as well as  information and service providers.
Recommender Systems are used in various domains to  generate personalized information based on personal user data.
