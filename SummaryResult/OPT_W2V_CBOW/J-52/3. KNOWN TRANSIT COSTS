We found that in the absence of per-hop information, the expected cost of each intermediate node equals its expected payment.
In addition, if all nodes are incentivized to forward packets, the  probability that the packet reaches the destination is the same in both scenarios, thus the expected benefit of the principal is the same.
Under the optimal contract that induces high-effort behavior from all intermediate nodes in the Nash Equi118 librium2 , the expected payment to each node is the same as its expected cost , with the following payment schedule : sB i = si ( x = xB
