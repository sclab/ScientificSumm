Third, we show that in the absence of a priori information about transit costs on the packet forwarding path, it is possible to generalize existing mechanisms to overcome scenarios that involve both hidden-information and hidden-action.
In settings where the intermediate nodes are  independent agents (such as individual nodes in ad-hoc and  peer-topeer networks or autonomous systems on the Internet), this poses an incentive problem; the intermediate nodes may incur significant communication and computation costs in the forwarding of packets without deriving any direct benefit from doing so.
However , the actions of the intermediate nodes are often hidden from the
