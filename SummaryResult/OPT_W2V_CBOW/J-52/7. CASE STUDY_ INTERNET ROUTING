Recently, several new architectures have been proposed in the context of the Internet to provide the principal not only with a set of paths from which it can chose (like BGP does) but also with the performance along those paths and the network topology.
In addition, the current protocol does not have the  infrastructure to support implementation of direct contracts between endpoints and the network.
However, the various proposals for acquiring network topology and performance information do not deal with strategic behavior by the intermediate nodes.
In this case , the principal ( e.g. , a multi-homed site or a
