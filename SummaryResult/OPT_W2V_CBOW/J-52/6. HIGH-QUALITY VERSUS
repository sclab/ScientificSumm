Therefore, it may be possible for the principal to  maximize its utility by contracting with only m of the n nodes along the path.
LOW-QUALITY FORWARDING So far, we have considered the agents" strategy space to be  limited to the drop (a = 0) and forward (a = 1) actions.
Under the optimal contract, sB i = (1−k+q)i c(k−1) q < 0 Therefore, under any other contract the sender will have to  compensate each node with an expected payment that is higher than its expected transit cost.
In particular , at the optimal contract , the low-outcome payment sB i is
