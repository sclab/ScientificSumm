We will show that FPSS induces an equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal their transit costs and forward packets if they are on the LCP.
The expected utility of a node not on the LCP is 0.
In addition to the generalization of FPSS into FPSS , we can also consider the generalization of the first-price auction (FPA) mechanism, where the principal determines the LCP and pays each node on the LCP its bid, pi(b) = bi.
4.2 Discussion More generally , for any mechanism M that induces a bid vector b in equilibrium by making a payment of pi
