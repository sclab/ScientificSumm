We also distinguish between direct contracts, where the principal signs an individual contract 1We use the notion of ex ante individual rationality, in which the agents choose to participate before they know the state of the system.
In other routing  scenarios, the sender does not have this a priori information.
Each action is associated with a cost (to the agent) C(ai), and we assume: C(ai = 1) > C(ai = 0) At this stage, we assume that all nodes have the same C(ai) for presentation clarity, but we relax this assumption later.
The outcome is a function of the
