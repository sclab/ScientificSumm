This is one of the few known results that shows how to export  approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms in a black-box fashion.
These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain.
We study a well-motivated special case of this problem, where the processing time of a job on each machine may either be low or high, and the low and high values are public and job-dependent.
However , whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in singledimensional domains , ours is the first work
