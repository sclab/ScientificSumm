This is one of the very few known results that use an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem.
Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem.
The possibility of constructing a truthful mechanism for makespan minimization is strongly related to assumptions on the players" processing times, in particular, the  dimensionality of the domain.
These are the first truthful mechanisms with non-trivial
