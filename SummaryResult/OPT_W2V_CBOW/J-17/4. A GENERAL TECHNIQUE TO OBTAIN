Theorem 4.4 Suppose algorithm A satisfies the conditions in Algorithm 1 and returns a makespan of at most c·OPT(p) for every p. Then, the algorithm A constructed above is a 2c-approximation, cycle-monotone fractional algorithm.
We will show that for every such maximal segment k , k +1, .
Algorithm 1 Let A be any algorithm that on any input p outputs a possibly fractional assignment x such that xij > 0 implies that pij ≤ T, where T is the makespan of x.
We first show that any algorithm that returns a fractional assignment having certain properties satisfies cycle monotonicity.
