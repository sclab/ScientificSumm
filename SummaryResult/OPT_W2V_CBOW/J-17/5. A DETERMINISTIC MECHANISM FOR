So if we augment x to a max-flow for (p1 , TL ), then by Lemma 5.8 (with p = pL and p = p1 ), all the jobs corresponding to n2,1 L must be assigned in this max-flow.
We remark that for the { Lj , Hj } -case where there is a common ratio r = Hj Lj for all jobs ( this generalizes the restricted-machines setting ) one can obtain a fractional truthful mechanism ( with efficiently computable prices ) that returns a schedule of makespan at most OPT ( p ) for every p. One can view each job j as
