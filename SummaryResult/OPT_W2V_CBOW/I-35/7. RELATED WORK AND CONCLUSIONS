We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a  generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic  content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.
Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.
The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is  intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to  incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 
The algorithm presented in the current paper can be
