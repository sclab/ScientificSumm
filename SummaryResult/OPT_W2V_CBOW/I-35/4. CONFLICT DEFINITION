That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under σ.
A (deontic) conflict arises between two  normative positions N and N under a substitution σ, denoted as conflict(N, N , σ), if and only if N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I ) and unify(¯I,¯I , σ).
The situations when an action is simultaneously obliged and  prohibited are, however, deontic conflicts, as both obligations and prohibitions influence behaviours in a conflicting  fashion.
However , in this paper we adopt the view of [ 7 ] in which the authors suggest that a
