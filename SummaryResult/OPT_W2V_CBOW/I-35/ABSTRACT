The distributed management of norms is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly  distributed computational realisations of normative models.
In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a  normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative positions  (obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents" actions.
We show this by  formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets and borrowing well-known theoretical results from that field.
Within a NS , conflicts may arise
