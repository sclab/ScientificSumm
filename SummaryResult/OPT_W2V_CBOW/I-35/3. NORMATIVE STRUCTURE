We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are  associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity.
Each rule is triggered once for each substitution that  unifies the left-hand side V of the rule with the state of the corresponding normative scenes.
These  conditions are either utterances or normative positions  associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g.
The first two points ensure that every atomic formulae on the LHS of a normative transition rule labels an arc entering the appropriate normative transition in the normative structure , and that the atomic formula on
