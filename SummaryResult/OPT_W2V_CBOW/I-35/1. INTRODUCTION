Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed  normative aspects into the agents" design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents.
However, there are very few proposals for computational realisations of normative models - the way norms can be integrated in the design and execution of MASs.
Since the regulation of a MAS entails that participating agents need to be aware of the validity of those actions that take place within it , such conflicts ought to be identified and possibly
