For instance,  rankby-revenue will yield the same revenue as rank-by-bid if we set credits to cs = es. 
An indirect way to influence the allocation is to introduce bidding credits.3 Suppose bidder s is only required to pay a fraction cs ∈ [0, 1] of the price he faces, or equivalently a (1 − cs) fraction of his clicks are received for free.
Hence the equilibrium revenue will be as if we had used weights w rather than w. The bids will be scaled versions of the bids that arise with weights w ( and no credits ) , where each
