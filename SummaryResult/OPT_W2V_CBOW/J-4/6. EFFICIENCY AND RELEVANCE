We would expect efficiency to be maximized at q = 1, since in this case a bidder"s weight is exactly his relevance.
After the swap, total relevance will have changed by the amount esxk−1 + etxk − etxk−1 − esxk = (es − et)(xk−1 − xk) > 0 As relevance strictly increases with each swap in the sort, total relevance is strictly greater when using q + rather than q.
As we see total value can be reinterpreted as total profits to the bidders and auctioneer combined.
for any set of bidders), they also hold in  expectation.
