The smallest possible bid profile that can arise in  symmetric equilibrium is given by the recursion xsws+1bs+1 = (xs − xs+1)ws+1vs+1 + xs+1ws+2bs+2.
It is straightforward to adapt his analysis to the case where bidders are assigned arbitrary weights and have separable click-through rates.2 As a result we find that in symmetric equilibrium, bidders are ranked in order of decreasing wsvs.
Let K ( r ) be the number of bidders with wsvs ≥ r , and assume it is at most K. We can impose a reserve score of r by introducing a bidder with value r and weight 1
