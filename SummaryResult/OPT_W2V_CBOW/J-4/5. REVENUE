There is no weighting scheme g such that the virtual score equals the score, for any density f. Proof.
Absent this  regularity condition, the optimization problem seems quite difficult because it is so general: we need to maximize expected  revenue over the space of all functions g. To simplify matters, we now restrict our attention to the family of weights ws = eq s for q ∈ (−∞, +∞).
It then follows from ( 7 ) that q = 0 will yield more revenue in equilibrium than q = 1.5 5 It may appear that this contradicts the revenue-equivalence theorem [
