We used a Gaussian copula to create dependence between value and relevance.7 Given the marginal distributions for value and relevance together with this copula, we simulated the revenue effect of varying q for different levels of  Spearman correlation, with 12 slots and 13 bidders.
The reason why efficiency and relevance suffer more with a reserve score is that this approach will often exclude  bidders entirely, whereas this never occurs when tuning weights.
At zero correlation, they give about the same  expected revenue in this instance.
To add a measure of reality to our simulations , we fit distributions for value
