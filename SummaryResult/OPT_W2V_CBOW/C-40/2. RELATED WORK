Q-Index [13, 11] is one of the earlier work that re-discovers the usefulness of grid-based space partitioning for emerging  moving object environments.
The basic idea of the Q+Rtree [14] is to separate indexing structures for  quasistationary objects and moving objects: fast-moving objects are  indexed in a Quadtree and quasi-stationary objects are stored in an Râˆ— -tree.
Recently, a number of publications have addressed the  scalability issue on how to support massive numbers of objects and queries in highly dynamic environments.
SINA [10] was proposed to provide efficient query  evaluations for any combination of stationary/moving objects and  stationary/moving queries.
