Query processing for the spectator S means to search the node structure whose cell region intersects with S. In Figure 3(a), E2 is indexed on the same cell, thus being delivered to the client S after the query evaluation.
Once we know the node structure of the leftmost cell per row, we can compute that of its right-hand cell from the leftmost node structure and the row-wise edges.
Once all the cells are evaluated, the moving edges are destroyed and the reconstruction step follows.
In summary , as shown in Figure 3 ( c ) , our edge indexing
