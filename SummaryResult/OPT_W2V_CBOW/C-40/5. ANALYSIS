Figure 6 shows that full update of edge indexing when the  maximum reachable distance is less than the side length of any moving entities takes constant time to update the corresponding edge  structures, which mainly depends on the side length of the given AOI.
The expected time of any single entity update for edge indexing with full update is : T edgefull per update = Èo∈O T edgefull per update ( o ) |O| = 2 ( m + 1 ) ( Ta + Td ) ( 5 ) The analysis of the expected time of any single entity update
