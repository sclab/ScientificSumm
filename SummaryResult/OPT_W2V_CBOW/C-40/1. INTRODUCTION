As a result, this  extensible gaming environment has accelerated the deployment of  usercreated content and provides users with unlimited freedom to  pursue a navigational experience in its space.
One of the main operations in MMOG applications that stream 3D objects is to accurately calculate all objects that are visible to a user.
To address these challenges, we propose a method that identifies the most relevant visible objects from a given geometry database (view model) and then put forth a fast indexing method that  computes the visible objects for each user (spatial indexing).
The traditional visibility determination approach , however ,
