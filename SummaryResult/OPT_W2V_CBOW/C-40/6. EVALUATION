However, the performance gain obtained by the incremental policy of the single-table is decreased compared with that in the slowly moving environment.
As a result, we can roughly anticipate that at least the 20Ã—20 grid cell partitioning retrieves a higher quality of visible sets than the RQ-OP.
To estimate the degree of real-time support of our  indexing method, we used the total elapsed time of updating all moving entities and computing visible sets for every cell.
A lower value of P implies that the query result set contains a large number of unnecessary objects that do not have to be
