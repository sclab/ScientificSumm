Now, suppose that there is a pure strategy for the leader that will give the leader a utility of 1.
We claim that an optimal strategy to commit to gives the leader an expected utility of at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | if and only if there is a solution to the INDEPENDENT-SET instance.
For every pure follower strategy t , we compute a mixed strategy for the leader for every one of the leader '' s types such that 1 ) playing t is a best response for the follower , and 2 ) under this constraint ,
