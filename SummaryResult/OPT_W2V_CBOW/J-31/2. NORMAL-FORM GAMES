We claim that there is an optimal strategy profile in which players 1 and 2 both obtain 1 (their maximum utility) if and only if there is a solution to the  BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER problem.
In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.)
Then , if the leader chooses as her mixed strategy the optimal settings of the variables ps
