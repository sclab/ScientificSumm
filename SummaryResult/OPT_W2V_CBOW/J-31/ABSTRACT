In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously.
Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.
The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the  exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the  designer is implicitly in a leadership position).
In this paper , we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both
