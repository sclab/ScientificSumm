In Bayesian games, the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the follower has only a single type, although two-player games in which the leader has only a single type can be solved efficiently.
While the correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a strategy that , if the following players play optimally , performs almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this definition becomes problematic when we consider that the other players may also be playing
