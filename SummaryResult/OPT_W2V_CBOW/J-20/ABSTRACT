Our algorithm replaced CPLEX as the clearing algorithm of the Alliance for Paired Donation, one of the leading  kidney exchanges.
We present the first algorithm capable of clearing these markets on a nationwide scale.
Also, in barter-exchanges generally, more agents are affected if one drops out of a longer cycle.
Solving it exactly is one of the main challenges in establishing a national kidney exchange.
Long cycles are forbidden, since, for incentive reasons, all transplants in a cycle must be performed simultaneously.
We adapt two paradigms for the task: constraint generation and column generation.
