This means we can largely avoid the expensive per node pricing step: whenever the constrained restricted LP has the same optimal value as its parent in the tree search, we can prove LP optimality, as in Section 5.2.3, without having to include any additional columns in the restricted LP.
However, motivated by the observation that an exchange solution can include only a tiny fraction of the cycles, we explored the approach of using column (i.e., cycle) generation.
If we attempt to find more positive-price columns than there are to be found , or if the columns are far apart in
