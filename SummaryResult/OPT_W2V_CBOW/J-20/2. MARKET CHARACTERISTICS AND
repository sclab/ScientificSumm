Note that there can be a large amount of variability in the  markets - in one 5000 patient market, less than 1000 patients were in the maximum-cardinality exchange.
If the patient and potential donor are incompatible, the two are entered into the  market.
Several papers have used variations of this process to demonstrate the effectiveness of a national kidney exchange (extrapolating from small instances or restricting the  clearing to 2-cycles) [6, 20, 14, 13, 15, 17].
