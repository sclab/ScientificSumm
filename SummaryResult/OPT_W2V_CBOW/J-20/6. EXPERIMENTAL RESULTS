In each of the next two algorithms, we turn one of these optimizations off to highlight its effectiveness.
The first algorithm is CPLEX on the full cycle  formulation.
By taking advantage of the properties of our problem, we manage to clear a market with 10,000 patients in about the same time it would otherwise have taken to clear a 6000 patient market. 
302 The combination of these optimizations allows us to easily clear markets with over 10,000 patients.
We begin with the following settings ( all optimizations are switched on ) : Category Setting Column Seeder Combination of greedy exchange
