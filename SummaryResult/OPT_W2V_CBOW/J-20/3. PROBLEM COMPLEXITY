One straightforward idea is to construct a tripartite graph with vertex sets X ∪ Y ∪ Z and directed edges (xa, yb), (yb, zc), and (zc, xa) for each triple ti = {xa, yb, zc} ∈ T. However, it is not too hard to see that this encoding fails because a perfect cycle cover may include a cycle with no corresponding triple.
It is clear that all vertices are covered, since M partitions X × Y × Z. Conversely, suppose we have a perfect cover by short  cycles.
Note that the construction only has short cycles of lengths 3 and L
