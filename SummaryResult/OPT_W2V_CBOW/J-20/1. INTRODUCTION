In contrast, the natural formulations of the kidney exchange problem (with L = 3) take at least cubic space in the number of patients to even model, and therefore memory becomes a bottleneck much before time does when using standard tree search, such as  branch-andcut in CPLEX, to tackle the problem.
In this paper, we 296 present an alternative algorithm for this integer program that can clear markets with over 10,000 patients (and that same number of willing donors).
However , the kidney exchange clearing problem ( with a limit of 3 or more on cycle size ) is different from
