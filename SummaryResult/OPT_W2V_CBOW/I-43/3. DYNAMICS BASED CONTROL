The other alternative would be to rely on the  estimation procedure provided by the User Level-to utilize the  Environment Design Level model of the environment to choose actions, so as to manipulate the dynamics estimator into believing that a  certain dynamics has been achieved.
DBC"s target dynamics specification can use the environment"s state space as a means to describe, discern, and preserve changes that occur within the system.
3.2 DBC View of the State Space It is important to note the complementary view that DBC and POMDPs take on the state space of the environment.
