EMT-based control is based on the Markovian environment definition, as in the case with POMDPs, but its User and Agent Levels are of the Markovian DBC type of optimality.
Notice that both of these limitations of EMT-based control are absent from the general DBC framework, since it may have a  tracking algorithm capable of considering pure sensory actions and,  unlike Kullback-Leibler divergence, a distribution deviation measure that is capable of dealing with negative preference. 
The prediction is based on the environment model provided by the Environment Design level , so that if we denote by Ta the environment '' s
