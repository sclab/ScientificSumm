This is followed by a review of the Extended Markov Tracking (EMT) approach as a DBC-structured control regimen in Section 4.
As actual system behavior may deviate from that which is specified by target dynamics (due to the stochastic nature of the system), planning in such  environments needs to be continual [4], in a manner similar to classical closed-loop controllers [16].
Experimental data demonstrates that even with a simple model of the environment and a simple design of target dynamics , high success rates can be produced both in catching the quarry , and in surprising the quarry ( as
