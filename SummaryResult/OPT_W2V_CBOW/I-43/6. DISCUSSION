The importance of the second source was underlined by the Tag Game experiment data, in which the greedy EMT algorithm, applied to a POMDP-type state space specification, failed, since target description over such a state space was incapable of encoding the necessary behavior  tendencies, e.g., tie-breaking and commitment to directed motion.
For instance, POMDPs have prohibitively large off-line time requirements for policy computation, but can be readily used in simpler settings to expose beneficial behavioral trends; this can serve as a form of target dynamics that are provided to EMT in a larger domain for on-line operation.
