Thus, for now, we assume that the cost is set as a function of the number of agents in the system (and that there is no possibility for agents to satisfy a request for less than the official cost or for requesters to offer to pay more than it). 
We then change the price of fulfilling a request so that the optimal ratio is maintained.
For example, changing the cost of fulfilling a request from $1 to $2 is equivalent to halving the amount of money that each agent has.
