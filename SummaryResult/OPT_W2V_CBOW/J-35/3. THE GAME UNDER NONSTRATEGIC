Since ∆k m is easily seen to be a closed convex set of distributions, it follows that there is a unique distribution in ∆k m that we denote d∗ k,m whose entropy is greater than that of all other distributions in ∆k m. We now show that, for n sufficiently large, the Markov chain Mk,n,M is almost surely in a state s such that ds is close to d∗ k,M/n.
If there are n agents , then the state of the game can be described by identifying how much money each agent has , so we
