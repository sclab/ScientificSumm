Learning a model to optimize for such measures might result in suboptimal MAP performance.
The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea.
Specifically, we present an SVM algorithm that globally optimizes a hinge-loss relaxation of MAP.
In contrast to recent work directly optimizing for MAP performance by Metzler & Croft [16] and Caruana et al.
In this paper, we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that maximize MAP performance.
The first approach is to learn a model that estimates the probability of a
