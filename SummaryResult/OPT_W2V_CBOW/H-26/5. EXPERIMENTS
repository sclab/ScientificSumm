Table 11 shows the performance of the models when trained on the TREC submissions with the best submission removed.
When trained on Indri retrieval functions (see Table 9), the performance of SVM∆ roc was slight, though not significantly, worse than the performances of SVM∆ map.
Tables 9 and 10 present the results of SVM∆ map, SVM∆ roc, and SVMacc when trained on the Indri retrieval functions and TREC  submissions, respectively.
5.1 Comparison with Base Functions In analyzing our results , the first question to answer is , can SVM∆ map learn a model which outperforms the best base TREC 9
