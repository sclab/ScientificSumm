We computed the scores of these five retrieval methods over the three indices, giving 15 base functions in total.
While our method is agnostic to the meaning of the  features, we chose to use existing retrieval functions as a simple yet effective way of acquiring useful features.
For the first set, we generated three indices over the WT10g corpus using Indri5 .
For both TREC 9 and TREC 10 , we used the description portion of each query and scored the documents using five of Indri '' s built-in retrieval methods , which are Cosine Similarity , TFIDF , Okapi ,
