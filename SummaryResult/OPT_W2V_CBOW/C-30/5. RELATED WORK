Since its foremost emphasis is reliability, the system does not attempt to improve the bandwidth delivered to the overlay participants by sending disjoint data at each level.
More importantly, the multicast recovery methods are limited by the bandwidth through the tree, while Bullet strives to provide more  bandwidth to all receivers by making data deliberately disjoint throughout the tree.
The key design goal of the tree construction mechanism is to have each node be an intermediate node in at most one tree ( while observing both inbound and outbound node bandwidth constraints ) , thereby reducing the impact of a
