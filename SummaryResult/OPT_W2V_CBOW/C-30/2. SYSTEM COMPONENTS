This is the process used to ensure that membership in a collect set propagated by a node to its parent is both random and uniformly representative of all members of the sub-tree rooted at that node.
It then  attempts to establish a number of these peering relationships with the goals of minimizing overlap in the objects received from each peer and maximizing the total useful bandwidth delivered to it.
This  random subset contains summary tickets of the objects available at a subset of the nodes in the system.
For instance , if multimedia data is being distributed to a set
