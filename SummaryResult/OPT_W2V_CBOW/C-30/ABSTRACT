Key contributions of this work include: i) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally likely to appear at any node, ii) a scalable and decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover missing data items, and iii) a complete implementation and  evaluation of Bullet running across the Internet and in a large-scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth  improvements under a variety of circumstances.
This paper presents Bullet , a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes spread across the Internet to self-organize into a
