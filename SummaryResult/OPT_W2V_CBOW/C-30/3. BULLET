In the general case, our owning strategy attempts to make data disjoint among children subtrees with the guiding premise that, as much as possible, the expected number of nodes receiving a packet is the same across all packets.
Essentially, this identifies which lfi fraction of packets of the received data stream should be forwarded to each child to make use of the available bandwidth to each.
When a data packet is received by a parent, it calculates the proportion of the total data stream that has been sent to each child, thus far, in this epoch.
In this case ,
