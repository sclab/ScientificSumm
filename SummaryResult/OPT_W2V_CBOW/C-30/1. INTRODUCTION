Rather than sending identical copies of the same data stream to all nodes in a tree and designing a scalable mechanism for recovering from loss, we propose that participants in a multicast overlay cooperate to strategically 282 transmit disjoint data sets to various points in the network.
One important benefit of our approach is that the  bandwidth delivered by the Bullet mesh is somewhat independent of the bandwidth available through the underlying overlay tree.
For example , the failure of a single node should result only in a temporary reduction in the bandwidth delivered to a small subset of participants
