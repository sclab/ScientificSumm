Given the sensors" observational uncertainty, the targets" uncertain transitions and the distributed nature of the sensor nodes, these sensor nets provide a useful domains for applying distributed POMDP models.
This paper focuses on a set of target tracking problems that arise in certain types of sensor networks [6] first introduced in [10].
We assume that there are two independent targets and that each target"s movement is uncertain and unaffected by the sensor agents.
Thus, sensors have to act in a coordinated fashion.
To track a target and obtain associated reward , two sensors with overlapping scanning
