The expected value for this joint policy is used to prune out the nodes in level 2 (the ones with upper bounds < 234) When creating policies for each non-leaf agent i, SPIDER  potentially performs two steps: 1.
On the other hand, when considering a leaf agent, SPIDER  computes the best response policy (and consequently its expected value) corresponding to fixed policies of its ancestors, πi− .
The key idea in SPIDER is to avoid computation of expected values for the entire space of joint policies , by utilizing upper bounds on the expected values of policies and the interaction structure of
