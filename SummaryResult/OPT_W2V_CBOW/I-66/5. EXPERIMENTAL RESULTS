Figure 5(d) provides the time to solution for all the  configurations with VAX (for varying epsilons).
In 3-chain and 4-star configurations, it is  remarkable that both PAX and VAX obtained almost the same actual  quality as the global optimal algorithms, despite the approximation  parameter and Î´.
