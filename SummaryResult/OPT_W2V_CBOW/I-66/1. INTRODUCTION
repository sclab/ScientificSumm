To address these problems with the existing approaches, we  propose approximate techniques that provide guarantees on the  quality of the solution while focussing on a network of more than two agents.
The first category consists of highly efficient approximate techniques, that may not reach globally  optimal solutions [2, 9, 11].
There are two key novel features in SPIDER : ( i ) it is a branch and bound heuristic search technique that uses a MDP-based heuristic function to search for an optimal joint policy ; ( ii ) it exploits network structure of agents by organizing agents into a Depth
