Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes  required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.
The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.
These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a  treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.
In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general , it is
