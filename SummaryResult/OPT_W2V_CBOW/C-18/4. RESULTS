We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3.
In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented.
Address Scanning : • Random : = addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space , namely , a 224 address space ; and • Local Bias : = addresses are selected at random from either
