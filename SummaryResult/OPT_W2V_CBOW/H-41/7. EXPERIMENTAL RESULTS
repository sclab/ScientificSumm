Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the  feature combinations.
In principle, we could do this by sorting the documents in each result set by their feature value, and compare the resulting NDCGs.
In order to keep the graphs readable , we will not show the performance of all the features , but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones : PageRank
