This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the  effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text  retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).
Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA.
In particular , we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness , the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam , and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently
