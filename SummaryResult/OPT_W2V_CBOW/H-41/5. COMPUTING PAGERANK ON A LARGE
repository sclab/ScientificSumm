But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.
For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.
In order to experiment with HITS and other query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms that require non-regular accesses to arbitrary nodes and edges in the web graph , we implemented a system called the Scalable Hyperlink Store , or
