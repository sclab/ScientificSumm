Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidder"s valuation multiplied by the probability of not  winning any of the other auctions.
To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single  secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.
Proof To prove this , we first show that G ( · ) and
