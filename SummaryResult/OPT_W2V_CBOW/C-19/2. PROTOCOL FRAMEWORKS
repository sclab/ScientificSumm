a protocol module can interact with all other  protocol modules in the same stack, not only with the protocol modules directly above and below.
A stack is a set of protocol modules (of different protocols) that are located on the same machine.
Below, we define the  different kinds of interaction between protocol modules.
A protocol is a  distributed algorithm that solves a specific problem in a  distributed system, e.g.
Stack 1 S1 Q1 R1 P1 Network Figure 1: Example of a protocol stack In Figure 1, we show an example protocol stack.
