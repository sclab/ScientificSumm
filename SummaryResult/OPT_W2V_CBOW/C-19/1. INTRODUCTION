In this paper, we propose a new approach for  building modular protocols, that is based on a service  abstraction.
We show that protocol frameworks based on services have several advantages, e.g.
Section 4 describes our new approach, which is based on service abstraction.
Protocol frameworks, such Cactus [5, 2], Appia [1, 16], Ensemble [12, 17], Eva [3], SDL [8] and Neko[6, 20], are  programming tools for developing modular network protocols.
To validate our claims, we have  implemented SAMOA - an experimental protocol framework that is purely based on the service-based approach to module composition and implementation.
Protocol frameworks such as
