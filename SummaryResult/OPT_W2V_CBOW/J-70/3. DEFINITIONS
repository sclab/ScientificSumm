We consider the following kinds of  mechanism: • A deterministic mechanism without payments consists of an outcome selection function o : Θ1 × Θ2 × .
In any automated mechanism design  setting with an IR constraint, there is a fallback outcome o0 ∈ O where, for any agent i and any type θi ∈ Θi, we have ui(θi, o0) = 0.
, θN ) gives the payment made by agent i when the reported types are θ1, .
A self-interested designer has an objective function given by g ( o ) + N i=1 πi , where g : O → R indicates the designer
