This does, however, turn out to be the case: given any mechanism, we can construct a nonmanipulable  mechanism whose performance is identical, as follows.
The agents report their preferences (or types) to the interface layer; subsequently, the interface layer inputs into the original mechanism the types that the agents would have strategically reported to the original mechanism, if their types were as declared to the interface layer.
However, because here we focus on flatly represented outcome and type spaces, this is not a concern here.)
Since the interface layer acts strategically on each agent '' s behalf , there is
