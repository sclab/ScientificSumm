Then, the utility that an agent receives for  reporting a type (given the true type) in either solution is the same, so we have incentive compatibility in the optimal  auction solution.
It follows that there exists a solution to the optimal auction design instance.
To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary  paymentmaximizing deterministic AMD instance, with a single agent and a uniform distribution over types, to the following  optimal combinatorial auction design problem instance with a single bidder with best-only preferences.
(Unless o = o0, in which case we allocate {} to the bidder.)
Also , suppose that the bidders '' preferences
