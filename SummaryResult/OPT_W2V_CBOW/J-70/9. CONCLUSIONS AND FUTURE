Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their  preferences truthfully, and a desirable outcome is chosen.
In this setting, we showed that designing an optimal  deterministic mechanism is NP-complete in two important  special cases: when the center is interested only in the payments made to it, and when payments are not possible and the  center is interested only in the outcome chosen.
We also want to study the complexity of automated mechanism design in settings where the outcome and type spaces have special structure so they can
