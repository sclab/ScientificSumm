The probability that j"s updated model is, say mt+1,1 j,lâˆ’1 , depends on the probability of j performing the action and receiving the observation that led to this model, and the prior distribution over the models at time step t. Because the chance node At j assumes the distribution of each of the action nodes based on the value of Mod[Mt j ], the  probability of the action is given by this chance node.
In order to obtain the probability of j '' s possible observation , we introduce the chance node Oj , which depending on the
