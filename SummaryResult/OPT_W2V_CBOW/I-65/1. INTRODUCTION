I-DIDs address this gap by allowing the representation of other agents" models as the values of a special model node.
Analogous to DIDs, I-DIDs may be used to compute the policy of an agent online as the agent acts and observes in a setting that is populated by other interacting agents. 
These formalisms seek to explicitly model the structure that is often present in real-world problems by decomposing the situation into chance and decision variables, and the dependencies between the variables.
In the previous representation of the I-DID , the update of the agent '' s belief over the
