I-DIDs may be seen as concise graphical representations for  IPOMDPs providing a way to exploit problem structure and carry out online decision-making as the agent acts and observes given its prior beliefs.
We showed how DIDs may be extended to I-DIDs that enable online sequential decision-making in uncertain multiagent settings.
work significantly by being more transparent, semantically clear, and capable of being solved using standard algorithms that target DIDs.
I-DIDs extend NIDs to allow sequential decision-making over multiple time steps in the presence of other interacting agents.
We are currently investigating ways to solve I-DIDs approximately with provable bounds on
