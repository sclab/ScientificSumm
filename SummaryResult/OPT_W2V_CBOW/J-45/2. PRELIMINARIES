When the game is finite (i.e., A and I are both finite), the probability that a ∈ A is played under s is written s(a) = s(ai, a−i).
When the distribution s is not  correlated, we can simply say si(ai) when referring to the probability player i plays ai under s. Next, we define the payoff (utility) function of each player i by ui : A1 ×· · ·×Am → R, where ui(ai, a−i) indicates the payoff to player i to playing pure strategy ai when the remaining players play a−i.
We can extend this definition to mixed
