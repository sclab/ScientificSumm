If we also have fixed the parameter θ of the simulator, the resulting data point becomes part of our data set D. This data set, then, contains data only in the form of pure strategies of  players and their corresponding payoffs, and, consequently, in order to formulate the designer"s problem as optimization, we must first  determine or approximate the set of Nash equilibria of each game Γθ.
Since our data comes in the form of payoff experience and not as the value of an objective function for given settings of the control variable , we can no longer
