Then ˆθ is a consistent estimator of θ∗ if W (N(θ), θ) is defined as a supremum, infimum, or  expectation over the set of Nash equilibria.
We first note that the function (s) is continuous in a finite game.
By the Corollary, for any game with a finite set of pure strategies and for any > 0, all Nash equilibria lie in the set of empirical -Nash equilibria if enough samples have been taken.
Then n(s) → (s) a.s. uniformly on S. Recall that N is a set of all Nash equilibria of Γ.
In this section , we
