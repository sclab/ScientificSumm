Additionally, there is an extensive  literature on optimal auction design [10], of which the work by Roger Myerson [11] is, perhaps, the most relevant.
[14] compared two mechanisms based on expected social utility with expectation taken over an empirical distribution of equilibria in games defined by heuristic strategies, as in [18]. 
In this work the authors used a common learning strategy for all agents and defined an outcome of a game induced by a mechanism parameter as the outcome of joint agent learning.
When payoff functions of players are unknown , a search using simulations has been explored as an
