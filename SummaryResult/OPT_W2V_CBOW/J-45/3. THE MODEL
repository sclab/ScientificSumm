Typically we care about W (N(θ), θ), the worst-case outcome of playing some solution.4 On some problems we can gain considerable advantage by  using an aggregation function to map the welfare outcome of a game 3 We generally adopt Nash equilibrium as the solution concept, and thus take N(θ) to be the set of equilibria.
Additionally , we wish to study games where the payoffs are not explicitly given , but must be determined from simulation or other experience with the game.5 Accordingly , we assume that we are given a ( possibly noisy ) data set of
