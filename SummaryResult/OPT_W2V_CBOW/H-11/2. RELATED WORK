The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental design are: â€¢ D-optimal design: determinant of Hsse.
2.2 Optimal Experimental Design We consider a linear regression model y = wT x + (1) where y is the observation, x is the independent variable, w is the weight vector and is an unknown error with zero mean.
We define f ( x ) = wT x to be the learner '' s output given input x and the weight vector w. Suppose we have a set of labeled sample points ( z1 , y1 )
