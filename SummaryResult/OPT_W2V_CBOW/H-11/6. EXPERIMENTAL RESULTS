Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images.
For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.
This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance.
It is important to note that the automatic relevance  feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].
It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system.
After the user provides
