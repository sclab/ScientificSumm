Then CTM calculates the first and second moment of these maps as a representation of the natural color image pixel distribution.
The  classifier is then used to re-rank the images in database.
This process can be viewed as an on-line learning process in which the image retrieval system acts as a learner and the user acts as a teacher.
The system selects some images from the database and request the user to label them as relevant or  irrelevant.
Our Laplacian Optimal Design algorithm is applied in the second step for selecting the most informative images.
