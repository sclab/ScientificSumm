The (n + 1)-th point zn+1 can be selected by solving the following optimization problem: max Zn+1=(Zn,zn+1) Tr KXX KXZn+1 KZn+1X + λ1KXXLKXX + λ2KXX −1 KXX (15) The kernel matrices KXZn+1 and KZn+1X can be rewritten as follows: KXZn+1 = KXZn , KXzn+1 , KZn+1X = KZnX Kzn+1X Thus, we have: KXZn+1 KZn+1X = KXZn KZnX + KXzn+1 Kzn+1X We define: A = KXZn KZnX + λ1KXXLKXX + λ2KXX A is only dependent on X and Zn .
Thus , the ( n + 1 ) -th point zn+1 is given by : zn+1 = arg min zn+1 Tr KXX A + KXzn+1 Kzn+1X −1 KXX ( 16 )
