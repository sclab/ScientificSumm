A common way to deal with this ill-posed problem is to introduce a Tikhonov regularizer into our loss function: J(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 + λ1 2 m i,j=1 wT xi − wT xj 2 Sij +λ2 w 2 (5) The Hessian of the new loss function is given by: H = ∂2 J ∂w2 = ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I := ZZT + Λ where I is an identity matrix and Λ = λ1XLXT + λ2I.
The loss function with our choice of symmetric weights Sij (Sij = Sji) incurs a heavy penalty if neighboring points xi and xj are mapped far apart.
