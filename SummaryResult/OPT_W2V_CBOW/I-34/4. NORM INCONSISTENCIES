The conflict resolution algorithm can be applied without change to accumulate a maximal conflict set ΣMAX c for each prohibition in Ω that unifies with obligations. 
The obligation demands that an agent performs an action that is forbidden.
With Definition 7, we 3 The combinatorial effort is not necessary anymore if instead we maintain a set of norms conflict-free: each time a new norm is to be introduced then we compare it with the existing ones, thus making the maintenance process of linear complexity.
Similarly , a situation of inconsistency can be defined reusing this definition and replacing the P
