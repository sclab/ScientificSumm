More  generally, we can capture a useful notion of inter-agent (and inter-role) delegation of actions and norms associated to them, and use it to address conflicts/inconsistencies caused by action delegation.
With an explicit account of norms, openness in virtual  organizations can be achieved: new components, designed by  various parties, can be seamlessly accommodated.
However, any realistic account of norms should address their  dynamic nature: norms will change as agents interact with each other and their environment.
Our approach neatly  accommodates the domain-dependent interrelations among actions and the indirect conflicts/inconsistencies these may cause.
Due to the changing nature of norms or
