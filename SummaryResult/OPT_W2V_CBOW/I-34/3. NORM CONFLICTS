In order to provide an Ω that reflects all these conflicts for a specific prohibition, we have to form ΣMAX c containing all conflict sets σc for a given  prohibition ω.
Our algorithm is correct in that it provides, for a given Ω, a new Ω in which i) all ground prohibitions which conflict with  permissions have been removed; and ii) all remaining annotated  prohibitions (Fτ:τ ¯ϕ) Σc, td, ta, te will not unify with any of the permissions in Ω , provided the unifier does not appear in Σc.
The first requirement is addressed by the first for each
