Further experiments found that, of the page features, those based on the text of the page (as opposed to the URL) performed the best.
Perhaps the most interesting result is that the Page-level features had the highest performance out of all the feature sets.

At each row, the feature set that gave the greatest increase in accuracy was added to the list of features (i.e., we conducted a greedy search over feature sets).
Because we evaluated the pages on queries
