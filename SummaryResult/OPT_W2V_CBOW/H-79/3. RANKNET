The goal of the ranking problem, then, is to learn a function f such that, )()(,, ji ffji xxZ >∈∀ 708 Note that, as with learning a regression function, the result of this process is a function (f) that maps feature vectors to real values.
By directly optimizing the ordering of objects, these methods are able to learn a function that does a better job of ranking than do regression techniques.
The only difference is the technique used to learn the function.
As with back-prop , RankNet attempts to minimize the value of a cost function by adjusting each weight in
