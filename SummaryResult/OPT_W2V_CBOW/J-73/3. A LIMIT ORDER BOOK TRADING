The  simplest way to instantiate this latter assumption in the order book model is to assume that each sequence S ∈ Σ starts by placing a huge number of sell orders (more than Vmax ) at price pmax .
We define {pj} to be the multiset of prices of  individual shares that are either executed or are buy limit order shares that remained unexecuted, excluding the activity of our algorithm (that is, assuming our algorithm places no  orders).
By placing an order at the beginning of the day , the algorithm undercuts all sell orders that will be placed during the day
