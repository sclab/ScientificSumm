It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q, we can in fact achieve a VWAP competitive ratio of 1.
In the price-volume model under the volume variability assumption, there exists an algorithm A that  always sells between N and QN shares and that the average price per sold share is exactly VWAPM (S).
In contrast to the VWAP , another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading ( OWT ) competitive ratio [ 3 ] with respect to a set of sequences Î£
