We emphasize that in these models, only the distribution of maximum volume and price is known to the algorithm.
In the remaining, we assume that Q is a power of 2 and the base of the logarithm is 2.
In the volume distribution model, we assume only that there exists a distribution Pvol over the total volume V traded in the market for the day, and then  examine the worst-case competitive ratio over sequences  consistent with the randomly chosen volume.
4.1 Results in the Macroscopic Distribution Model We begin by noting that the algorithms examined so far work by binning
