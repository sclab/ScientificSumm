For the upper bound, we can get a √ R competitive ratio, by buying all the shares once the price drops below √ Rpmin .
The Q upper bound is derive by running an algorithm that assumes the volume is Vmin .
(Sketch of Theorem 10) We use the idea of  guessing the total volume from Theorem 1, but now allow for the possibility of an arbitrary (but known) distribution over the total volume.
( Sketch of Theorem 4 ) The algorithm simply sells ut = ( vt/Vmin ) N shares at time t. The total number of shares sold U is
