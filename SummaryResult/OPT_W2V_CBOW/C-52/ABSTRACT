An additional property of the proposed  algorithms is that they require less number of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.
To mitigate this effect, we propose a budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing.
This algorithm makes the game very fair at the expense of  increasing the overall mean error of all players.
Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make this
