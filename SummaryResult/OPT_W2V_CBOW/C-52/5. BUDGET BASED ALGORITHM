The first two steps of the algorithm are the same as in the probabilistic algorithm; the trigger points are increased to lower the threshold and accumulated errors are used to compute the probability that a receiver will  receiver a DR vector.
This leads the receivers to build up more error in the probabilistic case as compared to the 1/3 base case where the receivers receive a DR vector almost periodically.
This algorithm ensures that every receiver has a guaranteed schedule of receiving DR vectors and hence there is no irregularity in sending the DR vector to any receiver as was
