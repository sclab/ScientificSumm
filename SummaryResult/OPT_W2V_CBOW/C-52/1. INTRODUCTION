Both the algorithms are based on delaying (or dropping) the sending of DR vectors to some players on a continuous basis to try and make the export error the same at all the players.
The drawback of this algorithm is that it tends to push the error of all the players towards that of the player with the worst error (which is the error at the farthest player, in terms of delay, from the sender of the DR).
It improves the fairness of the game but at the same time does so without pushing up the mean error of the
