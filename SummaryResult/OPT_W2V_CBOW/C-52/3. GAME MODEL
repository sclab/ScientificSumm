We assume a linear DR vector in that the information contained in the DR vector is only enough at the receiving player to compute the trajectory and render the entity in a straight line path.
This trajectory is followed until a new DR vector is received which changes the position and/or velocity of the entity.
The goal of the DR vector scheduling algorithm to be described in the next section is to make this  (cumulative) export error equal at every player independently for each of the entities that make up the game. 
This is not shown in the figure but
