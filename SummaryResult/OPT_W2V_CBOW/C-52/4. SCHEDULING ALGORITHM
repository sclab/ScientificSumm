, N, when a sender  generates a DR vector and decides to schedule them to be sent, it first computes the Ei values for all of them from the accumulated  relative export errors and estimates of delays.
Thus, if there is no accumulated relative export error, all that the sender needs to do is to choose the Î´"s in such a way that they counteract the difference in the delay to the two receivers, so that they receive the DR vector at the same time.
We also mentioned that the goal of the DR vector scheduling algorithm is to
