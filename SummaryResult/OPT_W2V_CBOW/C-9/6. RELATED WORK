Due to this  orientation they focus on different service models, provide no support for object mobility if even supporting a distributed object approach at all.
ARM can be compared to EDAS but supports no resource aware distribution.
JGroup focus on the active replication of objects but lacks support for more flexible services like EDAS does.

JavaSymphony [12] and Ibis [13] provide object mobility but are limited to the Java programming language and focus on object oriented high performance computing.
Actively replicated objects are provided by Jgroup [14] based on RMI.
