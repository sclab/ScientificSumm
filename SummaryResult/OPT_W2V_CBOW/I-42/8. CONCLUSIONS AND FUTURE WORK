We have also shown through some examples and experimental data that DCPOP can achieve greater performance for some problem  instances by extending the allowable input set to include cross-edged pseudotrees.
We have shown that the performance penalty is minimal to generate multiple heuristics, and that we can choose the best generated pseudotree in linear space-time complexity.
Given the importance of a good pseudotree for performance, future work will include new  heuristics to find better pseudotrees.
We have shown that DCPOP fully extends DPOP by performing the same operations given the same input.
We placed particular emphasis on the role that
