Each other node then receives a value propagation message from its parent and chooses the assignment for its domain that has the best utility given the assignments received in the  message.
The local utility hypercube is then joined with all of the hypercubes from the child messages.
A value propagation message with this assignment is sent to each node in C(Z).
At this point the agent at node Z  simply chooses the assignment for its domain that has the best utility.
It has been shown that this size directly corresponds to the induced width of the pseudotree generated in
