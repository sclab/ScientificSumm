We define an edge-traversal based method as any method that produces a pseudotree in which all parent/child pairs share an edge in the original graph.
This definition also yields two additional types of relationships that may exist between nodes : • BP ( X ) - the branch-parents of a node X : the set of nodes higher in the pseudotree that are connected to X but are not in the primary path from X to the root ( In Figure 2 , D = BP ( E ) ) • BC ( X ) - the branch-children of a
