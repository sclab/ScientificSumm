The algorithm also solves instances with traditional pseudotree arrangements  using the same procedure as DPOP.
We compare our algorithm with DPOP using several metrics  including the induced width of the pseudotrees, the maximum  dimensionality of messages and computation, and the maximum  sequential path cost through the algorithm.
Several current algorithms that solve general DCOP instances,  including ADOPT and DPOP, arrange agents into a traditional  pseudotree structure.
We introduce an extension to the DPOP algorithm that handles an extended set of pseudotree arrangements.
We prove that for some problem instances it is not possible to generate a traditional pseudotree using edge-traversal
