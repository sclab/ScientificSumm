To date, both categories of algorithms arrange agents into a traditional pseudotree to solve the problem.
We then show that our Distributed Cross-edged Pseudotree Optimization Procedure (DCPOP) performs significantly better in practice than the original DPOP algorithm for some problem  instances.
Current algorithms that solve complete DCOPs use two main approaches: search and dynamic programming.
This extension to the original DisCSP approach has become popular in multi-agent systems, and has been labeled the Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) [1].
Instead of finding an assignment that satisfies all constraints , these approaches find an assignment that produces a high level of
