Improved DFS based heuristics use a special procedure to choose the root node, and also provide an ordering function over the neighbors of a node to determine the order of path recursion.
The root then broadcasts the total complexity for that heuristic to all nodes.
In our experiments we used several evaluation functions that took as arguments an ordered list of ancestors and a node, which  contains a list of neighbors (with each neighbor"s placement depth in the tree if it was placed).
This increases the complexity of the place operation , but for all placements the total
