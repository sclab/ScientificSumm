Considering the worst (L04), average (P01) and best (NB) node in the grid, the speedups obtained were superlinear, close to linear and sublinear, respectively.
In the first experiment, a local  workload (formatdb) was introduced when the last task of the first TSS allocation starts and was stopped immediately  after the processing of one segment.
Three scenarios were simulated (table 5): 1) with PSS strategy, but without workload; 2) with PSS strategy and workload (PSS 2x), to use grid environment knowledge obtained in the preceeding iteration; and 3) Execution without PSS and with workload.
TSS also obtained a reduction of 5.56
