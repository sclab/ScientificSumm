The slave processes τ database segments and notifies the master, which uses the last Ω notifications to compute the next allocation block size based on the  selected allocation strategy and the weight provided by PSS.
It distributes the work units generated by the previous module and collects the notifications.
Besides that, we propose PSS (Package Weighted  Adaptive Self-Scheduling), a new strategy that adapts the chosen allocation policy to a grid with local workload.
Just as in mpiBLAST ( section 4 ) , we decided to use database segmentation in PackageBLAST with an NCBI tool called formatdb , which was modified
