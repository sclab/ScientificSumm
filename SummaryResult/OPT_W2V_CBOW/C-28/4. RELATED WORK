Having decided which sequences will be compared by each node, GridBlast sends the sequences, the executable files and the whole database to the chosen node.
GBTK is a master/slave application that receives the sequences and the name of the genetic database.
Master SlaveSlaveSlave Internet database segment but only part of it is processed in each node The database is replicated in the nodes, Figure 2: PackageBLAST segmentation and  distribution mechanism. 
Then, the queries are evenly distributed among the nodes.
When the search finishes, the results are compacted and sent to the master.
A method is proposed that associates data fragments
