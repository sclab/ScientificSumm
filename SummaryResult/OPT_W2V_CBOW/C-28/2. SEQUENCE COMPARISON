In the seeding step, a query  sequence is split in portions called words of size W. These words are matched to database sequences and used as  alignment seeds if their scores are higher than a threshold T. In the extension step, alignments are generated from seeds.
To compare two sequences, we must find the best  alignment, which is to place one sequence above the other making clear the correspondence between similar characters [7].
In this scenario, the use of exact methods such as SW is prohibitive.
