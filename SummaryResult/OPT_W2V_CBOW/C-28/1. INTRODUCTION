As far as we know, this is the first grid service that runs BLAST with multiple task policies with a segmented database in a heterogeneous non-dedicated platform.
Section 2 presents the sequence comparison problem and the BLAST algorithm.
Biological sequence comparison (or sequence alignment) is one of the most important problems in computational  biology, given the number and diversity of the sequences and the frequency on which it is needed to be solved daily.
SW [14] is an exact algorithm that finds the best local alignment between two sequences of size n in quadratic time and space.
This led to
