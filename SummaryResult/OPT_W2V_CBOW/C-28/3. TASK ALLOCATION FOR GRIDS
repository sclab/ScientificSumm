A(N, S) = 1, while work units are still left to allocate (4) In SS, the maximum imbalance is limited by the  processing time of a work unit in the slowest node.
Usually, grid applications are modelled as master/slave, where one problem is divided in many independent work units (tasks) of smaller size that can be distributed to slave nodes for parallel processing.
3.2 Task Allocation Strategies Given a master/slave application composed by a master m and S slaves , the allocation function allocate ( m , si , N , S ) determines how many tasks out of N
