Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to  execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as  compared to traditional approaches.
Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.
However , to the best of our knowledge , modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware
