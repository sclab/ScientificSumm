A promising approach to meeting these end-to-end QoS requirements effectively, therefore, is to develop and apply adaptive middleware [10, 15], which is software whose functional and QoS-related properties can be modified either statically or dynamically.
We have  implemented HyARM atop The ACE ORB (TAO) [13], which is an implementation of the Real-time CORBA  specification [12].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows : Section 2 describes the architecture , functionality , and resource utilization model of our DRE multimedia system case study ; Section 3 explains the structure and functionality of HyARM ; Section 4 evaluates the adaptive
