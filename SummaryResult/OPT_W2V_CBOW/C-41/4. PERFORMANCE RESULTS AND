Figure 4 shows that HyARM maintains system utilization close to the desired utilization set point during fluctuation in  input work load by transmitting video of higher (or lower) QoS for QoS-enabled (or best-effort) class of applications during over (or under) utilization of system resources.
As a result of over-utilization of resources, QoS of the received video, such as average latency and jitter, was affected significantly.
To evaluate the QoS provided by HyARM, we monitored CPU utilization at the two UAVs, and network bandwidth utilization between the UAV and the base station.
Figures 6 and 7 show that the values of
