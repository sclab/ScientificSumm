These techniques aid in  overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly and result in a rigidly scheduled system that adapts poorly to change.
HyARM can therefore be applied to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of control variables.
Although existing FCS algorithms have shown promise, these algorithms often assume that the system has continuous control variable(s) that can continuously be adjusted.
These variables are modified by HyARM to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved  application QoS. 
The DRE multimedia system as described in Section 2 is an example DRE system that
