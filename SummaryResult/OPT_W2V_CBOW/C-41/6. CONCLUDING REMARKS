To meet end-to-end QoS in dynamic environments, DRE systems can benefit from an adaptive middleware that monitors system resources, performs efficient application workload  management, and enables efficient resource provisioning for  executing applications.
HyARM employs hybrid control techniques to  provide the adaptive middleware capabilities, such as resource monitoring and application adaptation that are key to  providing the dynamic resource management capabilities for open DRE systems.
This paper described HyARM, an adaptive middleware, that provides effective resource management to DRE  systems.
Overall, HyARM ensures efficient, predictable, and adaptive resource management for DRE systems. 
We employed HyARM to a representative DRE multimedia system
