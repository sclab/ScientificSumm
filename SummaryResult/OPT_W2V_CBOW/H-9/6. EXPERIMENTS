In this  table, we can see that in both test collections, our method is better than both the baseline and the cluster-based methods.
In order to test the hypothesis that log-based method help more those queries with diverse results, we compute the size ratios of the biggest and second biggest clusters in our log-based  results and use this ratio as an indicator of diversity.
We use examples to show the difference between the cluster-based and the log-based  methods.
In our experiments , we observe that the sizes of the best clusters are all larger than 5 , and this ensures
