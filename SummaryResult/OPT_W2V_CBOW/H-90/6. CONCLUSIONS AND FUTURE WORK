The current work can be extended in several ways: First, we have only explored some very simple language models for  incorporating implicit feedback information.
In this paper, we have explored how to exploit implicit  feedback information, including query history and clickthrough history within the same search session, to improve information retrieval performance.
Finally, we should further study a general retrieval framework for sequential decision making in interactive  information retrieval and study how to optimize some of the parameters in the context-sensitive retrieval models. 
We will also do a user study to evaluate effectiveness of these models in the real web
