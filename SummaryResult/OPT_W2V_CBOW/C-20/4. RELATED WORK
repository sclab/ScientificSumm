In the context of network support, our work is related to the RouterFarm approach [2], which makes use of orchestrated  network changes to realize near hitless maintenance on provider edge routers.
At the core of our technique is the ability of encapsulate  applications within virtual machines that can be migrated without  application downtimes [15].
Recently, we proposed the notion of semantic-aware replication [13] where the system supports both synchronous and asynchronous  replication concurrently and use signals from the file system to  determine whether to replicate a particular write synchronously and asynchronously.
The Ursa Minor system argues that no single fault
