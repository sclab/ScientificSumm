Unfortunately in a wide area environment (WAN), live server migration is not as easily achievable for two reasons: First, live migration requires the virtual server to maintain the same network address so that from a network connectivity viewpoint the migrated server is indistinguishable from the original.
Second, while fairly sophisticated remote  replication mechanisms have been developed in the context of disaster recovery [20, 7, 11], these mechanisms are ill suited to live data center migration, because in general the available technologies are unaware of application/service level semantics.
In particular , since the virtual server retains the same network address as
