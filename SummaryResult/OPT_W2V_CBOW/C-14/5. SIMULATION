The graph shows that the confidence level to obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the number of sensors deployed.
For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure.
When  randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a placement providing a desirable minimum exposure.
The region monitored is of size 20Ã—20 with a noise ( AWGN ) of variance 1 , so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is 8 or more units length
