The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target  detection in a region of interest.
This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor networks performing target detection over a region of  interest.
The set of paths to be considered may be constrained by the environment.
An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4 and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in section 6 to determine the optimum solution for a given  environment.
In this study , the deployment is assumed to be random which corresponds to
