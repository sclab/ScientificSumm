For the proposed solution, we assume that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the minimum exposure ed is not reached.
As the minimum exposure e is a random variable , the cost of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure is reached is also a random variable C. We now derive the expression for the expected value of C. Let ni be the total number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum number of steps S so that nS = M. Note
