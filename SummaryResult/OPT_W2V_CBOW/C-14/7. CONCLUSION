We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to  deployment and sensors.
In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in steps is developed.
The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment.
The  solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by  considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step and this multiple variables problem requires further  investigation.
