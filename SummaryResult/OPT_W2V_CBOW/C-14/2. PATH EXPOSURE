A target traversing the sensor field using path P is detected if it is detected at some point u âˆˆ P. The exposure of path P is the net probability of detecting a target that traverses the field using P. The target is assumed to be able to follow any path through the field and the problem is to find the path P with the least exposure.
The problem of finding the least exposed path from west periphery to east periphery is then equivalent to the problem of finding the least weight path from a to b on this grid
