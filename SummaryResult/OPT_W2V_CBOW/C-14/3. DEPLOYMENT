By assigning a cost to both single  sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be deployed at first and thereafter can be determined.
However, a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and  deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the cost of single sensors.
The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.
The problem is to find a deployment
