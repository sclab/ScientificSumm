As can be seen, the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of  workflows grows; at 1000 workflows, the GA produces a 115%  improvement over the next-best alternative.
On the other hand, the random-proportional  algorithm uses many service providers, but because business processes are proportionally assigned with more assignments going to the better providers, there is a tendency for a smaller percentage of providers to become saturated.
Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows ( up to 1000 in our experiments ) , we implemented a simulation program that
