For every hotel we take the sequence of reports, and for each report (regardless of it value) we classify it as being good or bad However, to perform these tests, we need to estimate the objective value, vf , that is the average of the true quality observations, vi f .
vi f is assumed normally distributed around some value vf ; • δf ∈ [0, 1] can be seen as a measure of the bias when reporting feedback.
For a given hotel , we make the assumption that the quality experienced by the users is normally distributed around some value vf ,
