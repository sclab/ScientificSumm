In order to  investigate how a tighter limit in the result size affects the  performance of our algorithms, we performed two additional crawls to the generic-dmoz site: we ran the generic-frequency and adaptive policies but we retrieved only up to the top 1,000 results for  every query.
For the dmoz/Arts crawl ( Figure 12 ) , the difference is even more substantial : the adaptive policy is able to download 99.98 % of the total sites indexed in the Directory by issuing 471 queries , while the frequency-based algorithm is much less effective using the same number of queries ,
