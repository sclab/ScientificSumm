These classes,  summarized in Table 1, were designed to evaluate key aspects of a set of Coordinators distributed scheduling agents, such as their ability to handle unexpected execution results, chains of nle"s involving multiple agents, and effective scheduling of new activities that arise unexpectedly at some point  during the problem run.
The evaluation team employed an MDP-based solver capable of unrolling the entire search space for these problems, choosing for an agent at each execution decision point the activity most likely to produce maximum global quality.
In about half of the TT problems the year 1 agent under-performs
