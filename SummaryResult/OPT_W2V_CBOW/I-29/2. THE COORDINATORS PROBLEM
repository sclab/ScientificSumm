a may also inherit these constraints from ancestor tasks at any higher level in the task structure, and its effective execution window will be defined by the tightest of these constraints.
Instead, each agent receives only a subjective view containing just the portion of the task network that relates to ground tasks that it is responsible for and any remote tasks that have interdependencies with these local tasks.
Each task has an associated quality value which accrues if it is successfully executed within its constraints, and the overall goal is to maximize the quality obtained during execution.
