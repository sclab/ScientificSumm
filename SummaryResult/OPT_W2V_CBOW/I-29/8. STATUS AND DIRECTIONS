To provide more global perspective to local scheduling  decisions, we are introducing mechanisms for computing,  communicating and using estimates of the non-local impact of remote nodes.
To fully address various scale up issues, we are  investigating a number of more advanced coordination mechanisms.
Finally, we plan to explore the use of more advanced STN-driven coordination mechanisms,  including the use of temporal decoupling [7] to insulate the actions of inter-dependent agents and the introduction of probability sensitive contingency schedules. 
In addition to verifying that the performance on Year 1 problems is matched or exceeded , we have recently run some successful
