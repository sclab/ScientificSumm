We assume a team of  collaborative agents, each responsible for executing a portion of a globally pre-established schedule, but none possessing a global view of either the problem or solution.
Then, as time permits, the core local problem solving infra-structure is used to drive an inter-agent option generation and query process, aimed at identifying  opportunities for solution improvement through joint change.
The former hedges against temporal uncertainty by allowing execution to proceed from a set of feasible solutions , and the latter acts to revise the agent '' s schedule when execution is forced outside of this set of solutions
