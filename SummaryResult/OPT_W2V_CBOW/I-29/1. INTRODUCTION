In this paper, we consider the problem of managing and executing schedules in an uncertain and distributed environment as defined by the DARPA  Coordinators program.
Layered over this is a non-local option generation and evaluation process (similar in some respects to [5]), aimed at identification of opportunities for global improvement through joint changes to the schedules of  multiple agents.
Such factors as geographical separation of executing agents , limitations on communication bandwidth , constraints relating to chain of command and the high tempo of execution dynamics may all preclude any single agent from obtaining a complete global view of the
