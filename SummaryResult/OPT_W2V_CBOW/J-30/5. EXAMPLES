We can now apply  Theorem 2, and show that if the decision function f of the firm is multilinear (i.e., the decisions are made to maximize a set of multilinear functions), then the firm can design the education system such that the expected loss will be O( 1 k2 ), with a dominant-strategy equilibrium.
In this example, we assume that every agent has a  singlecrossing valuation function over the alternatives.
We show that the overall probability of success in such networks is multilinear in pi, and thus the optimal k-action social-choice function is dominant-strategy  implementable.
That is , there exists an
