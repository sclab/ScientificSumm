We devise a general framework for the study of mechanism design in single-parameter environments with  restricted action spaces.
Second, we identify necessary  conditions for the optimality of action-bounded mechanisms, and fully characterize the optimal mechanisms and strategies in games with two players and two alternatives.
While traditional mechanism design typically assumes  isomorphism between the agents" type- and action spaces, in many situations the agents face strict restrictions on their action space due to, e.g., technical, behavioral or regulatory reasons.
Our results apply to various economic and computational settings , and we demonstrate their applicability to signaling games , public-good
