In both families of algorithms, neighborhoods are formed by first computing the similarity between all pairs of users (for user-based) or items (for item-based).
The item-based algorithm we use is the one defined by Sarwar et al.
items and the recommended order , and is defined as τ = C − D p ( C + D + TR ) ( C + D + TP ) ( 6 ) where C is the number of pairs that the system predicts in the correct order , D the number of pairs the system predicts in the wrong order , TR
