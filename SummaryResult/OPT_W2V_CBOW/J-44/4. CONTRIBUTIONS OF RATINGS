A user"s neighborhood is characterized by a triple that represents the weighted sum of the role values of individual ratings involved in making recommendations.
We assume that we have a test set of the users" ratings of the items presented in the recommendation list.
Consider a user u and his ordered list of recommendations L. An item i 254 in the list is weighted inversely, as K(i), depending on its  position in the list.
For every pair of items rated by a user in the test data , we check whether the predicted order is concordant
