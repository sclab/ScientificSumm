These roles find direct uses in  improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of items and, most importantly, in helping monitor the health of the system as a whole.

We present a novel study that disaggregates global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles played by ratings in  nearestneighbor collaborative filtering.
For instance , they can be used to track the evolution of neighborhoods , to identify rating subspaces that
