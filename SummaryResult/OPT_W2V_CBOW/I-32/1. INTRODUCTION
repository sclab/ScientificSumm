In addition, we use the results presented in [9] to  discuss the importance of opponent modeling in our  ConnectFour adversarial domain.
In this paper, we develop a formal, axiomatized model for bounded rational agents that are situated in a zero-sum adversarial environment.
In addition, traditional search methods (like Min-Max) do not make use of a model of the opponent, which has proven to be a valuable addition to adversarial planning [9, 3, 11].
Early research in multiagent systems ( MAS ) considered cooperative groups of agents ; because individual agents had limited resources , or limited access to information (
