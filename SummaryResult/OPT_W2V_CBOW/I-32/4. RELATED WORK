The Mâˆ— algorithm presented by Carmel and Markovitch [2] showed a method of incorporating  opponent models into adversary search, while in [3] they used learning to provide a more accurate opponent model in a  2player repeated game environment, where agents" strategies were modeled as finite automata.
The research mentioned above dealt with adversarial search and the integration of opponent models into classical  utilitybased search methods.
However, the basic limitations of those search methods still apply; our model tries to overcome those  limitations by presenting a formal model for a new, mental state-based adversarial specification.
