As mentioned above, a  fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and  interact with it.
State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other  potentially interested sentient objects in the system.
We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of  information while interacting with sentient objects.
Object-to-environment interactions : correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment
