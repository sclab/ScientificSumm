The work presented in the paper is a contribution towards the  seamless interaction in such an environment which should not be restricted by technical obstacles.
The paper presented the general model of a sentient  object to describe composition, encapsulation and interaction in such an environment and developed the Generic Event  Architecture GEAR which integrates the interaction through the environment and the network.
One direction of future research will be the inclusion of real-world communication channels established between sensors and actuators in the temporal analysis and the  ordering of such events in a cause-effect chain.
Therefore , one of the main
