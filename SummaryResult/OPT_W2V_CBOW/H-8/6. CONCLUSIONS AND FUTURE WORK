We have many more experimental results that we  unfortunately did not have space for but that reinforce the notion that RTC is highly robust: with just a few judgments per topic, we can accurately assess the confidence in any  pairwise comparison of systems.
The confidence estimates of RTC, in addition to being  accurate, provide a guide for obtaining additional judgments: focus on judging documents from the lowest-confidence  comparisons.
In this work we have offered the first formal definition of the common idea of reusability of a test collection and presented a model that is able to achieve reusability with very
