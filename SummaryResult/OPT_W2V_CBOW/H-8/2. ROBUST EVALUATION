We argue that the best possible distribution of relevance p(Xi) is the one that explains all of the data (all of the observations made about the retrieval systems) while at the same time making no unwarranted assumptions.
If this is what it means, we can trust the confidence estimates.
For the confidence estimates to be  accurate, we need at least α · |Zα| of these pairs to actually have ΔMAP = −1 after we have judged every document.
By that we mean that if we have made some relevance judgments and have , for example , 75 % confidence that
