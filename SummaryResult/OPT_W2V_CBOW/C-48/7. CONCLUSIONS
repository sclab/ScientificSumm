In this paper, we have discussed the design and evaluation of a distributed data structure called DIM for efficiently  resolving multi-dimensional range queries in sensor networks.
Unlike traditional database indices that re-balance trees upon data insertion, in sensor networks it might be feasible to re-structure the zones on a much larger timescale after obtaining a rough global estimate of the data  distribution.
We have a working prototype, both of GPSR and DIM, and plan to conduct larger scale  experiments in the future.
There are several interesting future directions that we intend to pursue.
