Many of these attributes have scalar values, so one natural way to query events of interest is to use a  multidimensional range query.
In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are  sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, even for moderately sized network.
Such queries are useful for correlating events occurring within the network.
Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable  assumptions about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well with network size (both insertion and query costs scale as O( âˆš N)).
In this paper , we describe
