For sensor networks, we  assert that a centralized index for multi-dimensional range queries may not be feasible for energy-efficiency reasons (as well as the fact that the access bandwidth to this central index will be limited, particularly for queries emanating from within the network).
The underlying mechanism in these systems allows nodes to consistently hash an event to some location within the network, which allows efficient  retrieval of events.
Much work remains, including efficient support for skewed data distributions, existential queries, and node heterogeneity.
For example , if in a habitat monitoring application , a bird alighting on its nest
