If the algorithm succeeds in finding a Nash equilibrium s that satisfies EPVi (s ) ≥ T∗ − for all i = 1, .
For example, we may want to ensure that no player gets a negative expected payoff, or that the expected payoff to player i is at least Pi max − ξ, where Pi max is the maximum entry of i"s  payoff matrix and ξ is a fixed parameter.
This observation allows us to approximate Nash equilibria in which all players" expected payoffs differ by at most ξ for any fixed ξ > 0.
