Our approach is different in that we insist on outputting an exact Nash equilibrium, which is -close to  satisfying a given requirement.
This is in sharp contrast with the fact that graphical games on trees always possess a Nash equilibrium in which all players" strategies are rational numbers.
At the moment however, it is perhaps more important to  inves170 tigate whether Nash equilibria of graphical games can be computed in a decentralized manner, in contrast to the algorithms we have  introduced here.
Then checking if there is a Nash equilibrium in which none of the players assigns a nonzero
