In fact, in [13] the authors mention that this is indeed possible if one is interested in finding an (approximate) -Nash equilibrium.
It seems to be a novel feature of the setting we consider here, that an optimal Nash equilibrium is hard to represent, in a situation where it is easy to find and represent a Nash equilibrium.
From [2] it is also known that there exist 2-player, 2-action games for which the expected total payoff 163 of the best correlated equilibrium is higher than the best Nash  equilibrium, and we discuss this issue further in Section 7. 
Finally ,
