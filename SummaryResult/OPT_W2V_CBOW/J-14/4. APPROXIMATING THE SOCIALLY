Lemma 3 implies Pn i=1 |EPVi (s) − EPVi (t)| ≤ 24nPmaxδ, so by choosing δ < /(24nPmax), or, equivalently, setting N > 24nPmax/ , we can ensure that the total expected payoff for the strategy profile t is within from optimal.
That is, we cannot hope to have an algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium with total payoff at least (1 − )M(G).
If G has n players, let q(n) be an upper bound on the number of event points in the representation of any best response policy.
Hence , 167 we consider all pairs ( xk n ,
