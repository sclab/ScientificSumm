As we assume that Vn is a dummy  vertex whose payoff is identically 0, the Nash equilibrium with these payoffs exists as long as Tn ≤ 0 and B(Vn, Vn−1, T) is not empty.
, n. Let zl,k i = 1 if there is a discrete strategy profile such that for any j < i the strategy of the player Vj is a potential best response to the strategy of Vj+1, the expected payoff of Vj is at least Tj − , and, moreover, Vi−1 plays xl i−1, Vi plays xk i .
, n. We construct a strategy profile ti = max
