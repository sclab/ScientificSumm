It  follows that to find a Nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff, we have to maximize Pk−1 i=1 Ti subject to conditions u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui) for i = 1, .
• The expected payoff to V−1 is 0 if it plays 0 and u0 − (x − x )u−1 −x if it plays 1, where u0 and u−1 are the strategies of U0 and U−1, respectively.
It is easy to check that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the vector (u, 1/2, f(u)) is a Nash equilibrium.
Clearly
