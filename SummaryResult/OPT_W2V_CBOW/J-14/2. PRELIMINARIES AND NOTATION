Given an edge (V, W ) of the tree G, and a mixed strategy w for W , let G(V,W ),W =w be the instance obtained from G by (1) deleting all nodes Z which are separated from V by W (i.e., all nodes Z such that the path from Z to V passes through W ), and (2) restricting the instance so that W is required to play mixed  strategy w. Definition 1.
When a node V is instructed by its parent to adopt mixed strategy v , it does the following for each child U - It finds a
