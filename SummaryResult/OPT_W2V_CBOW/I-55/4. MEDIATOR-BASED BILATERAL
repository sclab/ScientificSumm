Note that when xh is an interior point of Oc then the  situation is symmetric for the two agents 1 and 2, and the mediator has the choice of either finding a point on IC1(xh) to  improve the utility of agent 2, or finding a point on IC2(xh) to improve the utility of agent 1.
That is, we will be searching for a point on the indifference curve of agent i, ICi(xh), while trying to improve the utility of agent j.
When it isn '' t possible to obtain a compromise direction for joint improvements at a
