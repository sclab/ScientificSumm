4 There is another Inverse Property 1 (IP1) that is required in an OT system for achieving the correct undo effect [21], but IP1 is not related to IT functions.
284 There are generally two ways to achieve OT correctness with respect to these transformation properties: one is to design transformation functions capable of preserving these properties; the other is to design control algorithms capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties.
To explore alternative solutions to these properties, we explicitly state the Pre-Conditions (PC) for CP1, CP2, IP2, and IP3 as follows: 1.
Given any operation Ox and
