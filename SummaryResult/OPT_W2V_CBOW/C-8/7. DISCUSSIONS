This has not only resulted in a cleaner and simpler logical structure to the algorithm itself, but also allowed a range of performance optimizations at the  operation buffering level.
In  GOTOANYUNDO, the do-part (a normal operation) and the  undopart (an inverse operation) need to be coupled for the  purpose of preserving IP2 [21].
The avoidance of RP, CP2, IP2, and IP3 has significantly simplified the design of transformation  functions and the OT system as a whole.
We have devised and implemented a buffering structure in which not only original operations but also transformed versions can be saved ; and all
