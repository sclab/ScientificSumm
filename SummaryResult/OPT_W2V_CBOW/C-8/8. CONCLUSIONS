The theory of operation context and the COT algorithm shall serve as new  foundations for addressing the technical challenges in existing and emerging OT applications.
The theory of  operation context is capable of capturing essential relationships and conditions for all types of operation in an OT system; it provides a new foundation for better understanding and resolving OT problems.
The COT algorithm has been implemented in a generic collaboration engine and used for supporting a range of novel collaborative applications [24].
We have contributed the theory of operation context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
The COT algorithm provides uniformed
