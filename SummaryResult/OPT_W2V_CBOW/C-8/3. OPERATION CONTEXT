When O is an original inverse operation, C(O) must include the operation to be undone by O (see Definition 4-Item 2), so CC1 preserves the do-undo ordering among normal and inverse operations [21].
2 It should be noted that the context-dependency relation is defined only between an original (either normal or inverse) operation and another operation of any type (original or transformed).
Since every transformed operation must come from an original operation, we use the notation org(O) to denote the original operation of O.
To achieve the undo effect in [ 21 ] , an original inverse operation
