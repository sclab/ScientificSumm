In this paper, we report the main results of this effort: the theory of operation  context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
This puzzle was solved in various ways, but the theory of causality as well as its limitation were inherited by all follow-up OT algorithms.
In Section 4, we present the basic COT  algorithm for supporting consistency maintenance (do) and group undo under the assumption that underlying  transformation functions are able to preserve some important  transformation properties.
The dOPT algorithm was the first OT algorithm and was based solely on the concurrency relationships among operations [ 4 ] :
