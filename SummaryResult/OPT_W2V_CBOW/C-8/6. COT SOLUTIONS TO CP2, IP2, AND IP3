An  inverse O is IP3-safe with respect to CD if it is made from a transformed version of O, which has included all operations in CD that are context-independent of O.
285 {O}; (2) select all operations from CD which are  contextindependent of O and create a new context difference NCD; (3) transform O against operations in NCD (by recursively invoking transform()); (4) create a new inverse from the transformed O; and (5) create a new CD by subtracting NCD from the old CD (the new CD must maintain the  total order as required for solving CP2).
