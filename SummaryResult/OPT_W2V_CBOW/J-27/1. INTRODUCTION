This approach is useful when there is reason to make these stipulations, it gives an explicit utility function which can be used to make precise forecasts on demand for  unob36 served prices.
However, these methods do not consider the complexity of the demand functions and do not use any probabilistic model of the observations.
This gives an  improvement on Varian"s original bounds, though the basic idea is still to rule out demands that are revealed inferior.
Given observations of price and demand , under what circumstances can we conclude that the data is consistent with the behavior of
