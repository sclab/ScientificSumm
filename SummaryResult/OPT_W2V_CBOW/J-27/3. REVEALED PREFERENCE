D(A) has no negative cycles, hence G is acyclic and breadth first search can assign potentials φi such that φj ≤ φi + wij for (i, j) ∈ S ∪ E. We relabel the vertices so that φ1 ≥ φ2 ≥ .
Now, C has weight svavu+ X (k,l)∈C\(v,u) skak,l ≥ svav,u+sp(n−1) max (i,j)∈S {aij } ≥ 0, i.e., C has non-negative weight ✷ Algorithm 1 returns in polynomial time a hypothesis that is a piecewise linear function and agrees with the labeling of the observation namely sample error zero.
