The demand function of the agent is the correspondence fu : Rn + → Rn + satisfying f(p) = argmax{u(x) : p · x ≤ I} In general this correspondence is not necessarily single  valued, but it is implicit in the proof of Afriat"s theorem that any set of observations can be rationalized by a demand function that is single valued for unobserved prices.
However, in such cases the demand will be an interior point of the budget set and the less preferred bundles won"t be observed.
The second assumption we make on the utility is that all
