, pn is shattered it suffices to find for every b a demand function fb supported by concave utility such that fb(pi) = yb i .
, pid be price vectors satisfying the following conditions: 1. the budget sets Bs i are supporting hyperplanes of a convex polytope Λi 2. yi is a vertex of Λi 3.
, yid be points on the facets of Λi that intersect yi, such that ||pjr||1 · ||yi − yis||∞ = o(1) for all j, s and r. We call the set of points yi, yi1, .
, ( ynd , pnd ) is consistent with monotone concave utility
