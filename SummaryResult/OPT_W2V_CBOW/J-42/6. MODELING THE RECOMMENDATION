The number of senders and receivers have large negative  coefficients, showing that successfully recommended products are more likely to be not so widely popular.
The only two  attributes with a positive coefficient are the number of  recommendations and price.
We use a regression of the following product attributes to correlate them with recommendation success : • r : number of recommendations • ns : number of senders of recommendations • nr : number of recipients of recommendations • p : price of the product • v : number of reviews of the product • t : average product rating 235
