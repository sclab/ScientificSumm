Further, a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy, which expands the text of the Web page to reduce  vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement, can yield extra gains in average precision of 50%.
They suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms.
Our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem (referred to as AAK for ads and keywords) can yield gains in average precision figures of 60% compared to a trivial vector-based strategy.
The current boom of the Web is associated with the revenues originated from on-line
