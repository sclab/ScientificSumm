For the first time in the area of TDT, we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic events.
Nevertheless, we believe our simple and effective method will be useful for all TDT  practitioners, and will be especially useful for the initial exploratory analysis of news streams. 
Future work includes evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news stream , and comparing our model against the closest equivalent methods , which currently are limited to the methods of Kleinberg [ 12 ] ( which can only detect certain type of bursty events depending
