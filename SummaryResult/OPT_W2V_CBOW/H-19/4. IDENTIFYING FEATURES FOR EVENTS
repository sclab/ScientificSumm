(Dominant Power Spectrum) The  dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.
Clearly, the trajectory of your is very different from beenb, which means that the former has to be considered separately.
Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas.
At first glance , we may be
