We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.
, yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) Ã— log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF)  containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of  documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 
Let
