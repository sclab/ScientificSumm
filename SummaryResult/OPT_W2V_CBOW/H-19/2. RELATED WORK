In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 
Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.
Their focus was on detecting multiple  periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.
Our work differs from [ 9 ] in several ways : 1
