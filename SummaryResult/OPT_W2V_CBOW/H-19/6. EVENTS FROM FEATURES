We define the degree of document overlap  between two features fi and fj as follows.
The set of features similar to fi can then collectively describe an event.
1 is employed to compute the similarity between two periodic features, Next, we define the overal similarity among a set of  features R using the maximum inter-feature KL-Divergence value as follows.
2. fi and fj have a high document overlap.
Specifically, we need to find a subset Ri of HH that minimizes the following cost function: C(Ri) = KL(Ri) d(Ri) fj ∈Ri Sfj , Ri ⊂ HH.
Furthermore , trivial events
