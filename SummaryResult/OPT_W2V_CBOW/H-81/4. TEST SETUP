Especially, no collection from the MPEG-7 dataset was used in the evaluation because the evaluations should show, how well the descriptors and the recommended distance measures perform on "unknown" material.
The other basic shape descriptor, Contour-based Shape, was not used, because it produces structurally different descriptions that cannot be transformed to data vectors with elements measuring on interval-scales.
The querying process was performed in the following steps : ( 1 ) random selection of a ground truth group , ( 2 ) random selection of a query object from this group , ( 3 ) distance comparison
