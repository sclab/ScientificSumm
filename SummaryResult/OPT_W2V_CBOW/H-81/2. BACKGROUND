Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.
To overcome this shortage, researchers from different areas have developed alternative models that are mostly predicate-based (descriptors are assumed to contain just binary elements, e.g.
In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 
If distance is defined minimal, the query object is always in the origin of distance space and similar candidates should form clusters around the origin that are as large as possible.
