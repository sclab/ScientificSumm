Remarkably for a predicate-based measure, Tversky's Feature Contrast Model (P1) is also in the group of very good measures (even though it is not among the best) that ends with Q5, the correlation coefficient.
For each descriptor the best measure and the performance of the MPEG-7 recommendation are shown.
For artificial images the pattern difference and the Hamming distance produce comparable results as well.
135 best distance measures per descriptor , Section 5.2 shows the best overall distance measures and Section 5.3 points out other interesting results ( for example , distance measures that work particularly good on specific
