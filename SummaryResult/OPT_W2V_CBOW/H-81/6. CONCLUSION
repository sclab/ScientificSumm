In the evaluation the best overall distance measures for visual content - as extracted by the visual MPEG-7 descriptors - turned out to be the pattern difference measure and the Meehl index (for homogeneous descriptions).
This work offers suitable distance measures for various situations.
The evaluation presented in this paper aims at testing the recommended distance measures and finding better ones for the basic visual MPEG-7 descriptors.
In consequence, the distance measures identified as the best will be implemented in the open MPEG-7 based visual information retrieval framework VizIR [4].
To be able to use predicate-based distance measures next to quantitative measures
