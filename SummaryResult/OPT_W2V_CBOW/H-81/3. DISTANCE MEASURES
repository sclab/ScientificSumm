Since MPEG-7 descriptions are purely quantitative but some of the most sophisticated distance measures are defined exclusively on predicates, a model is mandatory that allows the application of predicate-based distance measures on quantitative data.
For example, the L1 metric (Manhattan metric) degenerates to the Hamming distance (from [9], without weights): distanceHammingcbxxL k jkik =+≡−= ∑1 If it can be shown that the quantisation model is able to reconstruct the quantitative measure from the degenerated predicate-based measure, the model is obviously able to extend predicate-based measures to the quantitative domain.
In the following it will be used to extend successful predicate-based
