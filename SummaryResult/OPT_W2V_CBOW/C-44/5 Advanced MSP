For each scan, all the nodes are sorted according to the gap, which is the diameter of the polygon along the direction of the scan, to produce a second, gap-based node sequence.
Four Cases in DBE Process no neighbor node in the original event-based node sequence shares an overlapping area, or if the neighbors have not been processed due to bigger gaps, a uniform distribution Uniform() is applied to this isolated node (the Alone case in Figure 8).
We noted that in basic MSP , only the anchors are used to narrow down the polygon of each target node ,
