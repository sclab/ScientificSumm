To overcome limitations in  existing solutions, we present a Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments.
Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and  effective range of sensor devices.
This  evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on  sensor nodes nor precise event distribution.
The novel idea behind MSP is to reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences , easily
