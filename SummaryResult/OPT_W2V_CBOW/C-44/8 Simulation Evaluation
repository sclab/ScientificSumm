Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we compare regular scan with random scan under different  number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.
For example, when the number of scans is 30, errors in sequence-based MSP are about 20% of that of basic MSP.
For example, adaptive MSP improves  localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10.
The two curves present the performance of  iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to sequence-based MSP.
