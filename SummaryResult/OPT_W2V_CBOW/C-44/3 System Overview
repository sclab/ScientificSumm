As each event propagates, as shown in Figure 1(a), each node detects it at some particular time  instance.
For a single event, we call the ordering of nodes, which is based on the sequential detection of the event, a node  sequence.
Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).
For the sake of clarity in presentation , we present our system in two cases : â€¢ Ideal Case , in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct , and nodes
