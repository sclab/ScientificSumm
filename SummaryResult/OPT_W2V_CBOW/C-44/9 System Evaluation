Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.
Impact of the Number of Anchors and Scans 9.1.3 On Number of Anchors and Scans In this experiment, we show a tradeoff between hardware cost (anchors) with soft cost (events).
As shown in Figure 25, 20 motes were placed as five groups in front of the speaker, four nodes in each group at roughly the same distances to the speaker.
In the  outdoor system, a Dell A525 speaker is used to generate 4.7KHz sound as shown in Figure 20.
