This solution is based on the fact that nodes have a high probability of flipping in the sequence if they are near to each other along the event propagation direction.
In a practical implementation, supposing that the ultrasound event is used, if the maximum error of system time synchronization is 1ms, two nodes might flip with high  probability if the timestamp difference between the two nodes is smaller than or equal to 1ms.
The sequence flip problem would appear even in an accurately synchronized system due to random jitter in node detection if an event arrives at multiple nodes almost
