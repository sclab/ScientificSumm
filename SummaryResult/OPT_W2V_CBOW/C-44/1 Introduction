To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in  deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors.
â€¢ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive events.
We  demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly  improve localization accuracy.
Second , compared to a range-free approach , MSP needs only a small number of anchors ( theoretically , as few as two )
