For each node, GetBoundaries() in line 5 searches for the  predecessor and successor anchors in the sequence so as to  determine the boundaries of this node.
Since the locations of the anchor nodes are available, the anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area vertically and horizontally into 16 parts, as shown in Figure 2.
Basic MSP only makes use of the order information  between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence.
