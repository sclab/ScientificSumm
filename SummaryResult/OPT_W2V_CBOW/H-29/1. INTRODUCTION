Next, a single feedback model vector is computed according to some sort of average,  centroid, or expectation over the set of possibly-relevant  document models.
Figure 1: Estimating the uncertainty of the feedback model for a single query. 
In this way, retrieval algorithms may attempt to quantify the risk or uncertainty associated with their  output rankings, or improve the stability or precision of their internal calculations.
With this in mind , we wish to treat many important quantities calculated by the retrieval system , whether a relevance score for a document , or a weight for a query expansion term ,
