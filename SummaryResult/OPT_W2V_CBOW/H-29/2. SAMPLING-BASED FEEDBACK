Our sample space is the set of all possible language  models LF that may be output as feedback models.
Although the Dirichlet is a unimodal distribution, and in general quite limited in its expressiveness in the sample space, it is a  natural match for the multinomial language model, can be  estimated quickly, and can capture the most salient features of confident and uncertain feedback models, such as the overall spread of the distibution.
The prior probability of a word '' s membership in the relevant class is given by the probability of the original query in the entire enhanced expansion
