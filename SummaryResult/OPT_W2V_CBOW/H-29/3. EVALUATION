In this section we present results confirming the usefulness of estimating a feedback model distribution from weighted resampling of top-ranked documents, and of combining the feedback models obtained from different small changes in the original query.
Also shown are the actual number of queries hurt by feedback (nâˆ’) for each method and collection.
Because we found that the baseline (Indri) expansion method performed better using a stopword list with the feedback model, all experiments used a stoplist of 419 common  English words.
If we turn off the stopword list , however , we obtain results such as those shown in
