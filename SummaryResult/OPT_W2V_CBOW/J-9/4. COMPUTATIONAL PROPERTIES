Note that, by Theorem 1, p∞ is exactly agent i"s conditional expectation of the value of f(x), given her final possibility set S∞ i .
It is possible that the equilibrium price p∞ of the security F will not be either 0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it.
If she observes x1 = 0, her expectation of the value of F is the conditional probability that x2 = 1, which is also 1 2 .
7 We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in the sense that it assigns
