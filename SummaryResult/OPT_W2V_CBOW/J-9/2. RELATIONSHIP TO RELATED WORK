That is, the  dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality of the event space over which information is to be  aggregated.2 In this ideal case, all private information becomes common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function of the private information can be directly evaluated by any agent or observer.
We show that properties of the function itself play a major role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information and security spaces.
per, we investigate cases in which even this partial  aggregation fails.
Still , it is generally assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions represented in
