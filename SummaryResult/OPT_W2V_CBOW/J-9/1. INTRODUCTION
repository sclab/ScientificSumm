As a result, market prices  encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all  information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.
In this paper, we investigate the nature of the  computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information  markets.
We prove that only Boolean securities whose payoffs can be expressed as  threshold functions of the distributed input bits of information are guaranteed to converge as predicted by rational expectations theory.
