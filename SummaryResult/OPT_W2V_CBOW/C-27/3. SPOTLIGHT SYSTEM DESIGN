The implementation of the Point Scan EDF The Point Scan EDF can be generalized to the case where nodes are placed in a two dimensional plane R2 .
It is important to remark that the localization error is independent of the number of sensor nodes in the network.
At t = 4 the section where each node resides can be determined A more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the plane, hence the number of bits in the code will increase.
- Uncertainty in Detection : the sampling rate of the sensor nodes is finite , consequently , there will be
