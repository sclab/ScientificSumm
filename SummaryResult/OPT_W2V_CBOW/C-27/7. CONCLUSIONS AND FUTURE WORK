the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.
A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 
The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.
All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.
This error is currently state of art , even for range-based localization systems and it is 75 %
