Event Size for the Point Scan EDF The obtained localization error varied from as little as 2cm to over 11cm for the largest event.
Event Size for the Point Scan EDF 5.2 Line Scan - Î¼Spotlight system In a similar manner to the Point Scan EDF, for the Line Scan EDF we were interested in the dependency of the localization error and duration on the size of the event and scanning speed.
The parameters that we varied during the performance evaluation of our system were : the type of scanning ( Point , Line and Area ) , the size of
