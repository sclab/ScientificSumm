In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.
To overcome the challenges posed by the range-based localization schemes, when applied to sensor networks, a different approach has been proposed and evaluated in the past.
This approach is called range-free and it attempts to obtain location information from the proximity to
