After giving specific (worst-case) relative price sequences in which small perturbations  generate large changes in basic statistics (for example, altering the number of shares traded by a factor of two), we proceed to demonstrate that the difference in stability properties of the two models is more than merely theoretical.
Specifically , we are interested in the following natural question : To what extent are simple models of limit order markets either susceptible or immune to butterfly effects - that is , the infliction of large changes in important activity statistics ( such as the 120 number of shares traded or
