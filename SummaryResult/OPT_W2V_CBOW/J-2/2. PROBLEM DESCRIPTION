Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.
After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribution payment.
(This assumption is not harmful: in environments where anyone can join the auction, running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway, because everyone would want to join to collect part of the redistribution.)
, an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
We do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi ; because of
