Moreover, there are actually infinitely many mechanisms that redistribute 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case-for example, any convex combination of the above two will redistribute 100% if both ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 and ˆvm+3 = 0.
Thus, this mechanism also redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case.
Thus, it seems most natural to compare mechanisms by the percentage of total VCG payment that they redistribute in the worst case.
MECHANISMS Among all linear VCG redistribution mechanisms , we would like to be able to identify the one that redistributes the greatest percentage of the total
