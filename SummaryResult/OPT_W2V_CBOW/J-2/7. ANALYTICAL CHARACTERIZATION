, n − 1 is a feasible solution and ˆk ≥ k∗ , then since all the inequalities in Claim 4 are satisfied, we must have ˆxi = x∗ i and ˆk = k∗ .
, n−m−1, we get (m + i)x∗ m+i−1 + (n − m − i)x∗ m+i = m if i is even (m + i)x∗ m+i−1 + (n − m − i)x∗ m+i = k∗ m if i is odd Finally by adding all the equations, we get nx∗ n−1 = m if n − m is even; nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m if n − m is odd.
Moreover , we will prove that when
