There exist ways of determining the payments that the agents make in such an auction that  incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that is, the payments make the auction strategy-proof.
One way of trying to  design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the agents" incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained), and that will maintain the other properties.
Around the same time
