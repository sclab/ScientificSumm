So j > m. Incidentally, this claim also shows that if m = n − 1, then ci = 0 for all i.
, n−1 (when m + 2 > n − 1, this set of equalities is empty) qn = −(n − 1)cn−1 By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, .
, n. Because ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to Qm+1ˆvm+1 + Qm+2ˆvm+2 + .
+ qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n Pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m So, the non-deficit constraint can be written as a set of linear inequalities involving only the ci.
We
