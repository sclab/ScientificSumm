For n = 20, this is 5.26e − 3, whereas the remaining percentage for the worst-case optimal mechanism is 3.62e−5 in the worst case.
of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed by the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism in the worst case (which is equal to 2 n ).
Hence the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed is ˆv2− 2 n ˆv3− n−2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 , which has an expected value of E( 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 ) = 2 n − 2 n E ˆv3 ˆv2 .
Correspondingly , the third
