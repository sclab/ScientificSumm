If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent always receives a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism is individually rational.
Example 1 (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism): Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n and ci = 0 for all other i.
Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any bid vector, zn ≥ 0.
The mechanism is strategy-proof, because for all i, zi is independent of ˆvi.
If all redistribution payments are always nonnegative , then the mechanism must be individually rational ( because the VCG mechanism is
