Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on  designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents" preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).
This work is part of a growing literature on designing mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case.
Here we proposed a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment 38 back to the agents.
In such settings , the worst-case criterion provides no guidance
