We address this problem and extend CTLK (computation tree logic with knowledge) with a notion of plausibility, which allows for practical and counterfactual reasoning.
The new logic CTLKP (CTLK with plausibility) includes also a  particular notion of belief.
In particular, we show that, for a natural class of models, belief is a KD45 modality.
Logics of knowledge and belief are often too static and  inflexible to be used on real-world problems.
A plausibility update operator is added to this logic in order to change plausibility assumptions  dynamically.
Furthermore, we examine some important  properties of these concepts.
We also show that
