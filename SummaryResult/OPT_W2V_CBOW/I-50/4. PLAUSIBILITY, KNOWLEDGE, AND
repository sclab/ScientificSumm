Then Kaϕ → Baϕ is strongly valid, and in the class of p-serial models we have even that |≡ Kaϕ ↔ Baϕ.
Note that this characterization has a strong commonsense reading: believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all plausibly imaginable situations.
4.3 Properties of the Update The first notable property of plausibility update is that it influences only formulae in which plausibility plays a role, i.e.
It is easy to see that the axiom is not valid in general : as we have no restrictions on plausibility sets Υa , it may be as well that
