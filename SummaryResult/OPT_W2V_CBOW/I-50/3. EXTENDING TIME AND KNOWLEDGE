The idea of defining beliefs is given by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of Ω(q,a); formally, this can be stated as Baϕ ≡ Ka( →a ϕ).
Ultimately, we are going to be interested in normal (not strong) validity, as parameterizing the satisfaction relation with a set P is just a technical device for propagating sets of plausible paths Υa into the semantics of nested formulae.
In our models , plausibility is also global , i.e. , plausibility sets do not depend on the
