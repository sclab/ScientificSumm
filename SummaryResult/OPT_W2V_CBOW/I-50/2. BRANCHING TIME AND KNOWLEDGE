We assume that relation R is serial and that all ∼a are equivalence relations.
The semantics of CTLK is based on Kripke models M = Q, R, ∼1, ..., ∼k, π , which include a nonempty set of states Q, a state transition relation R ⊆ Q × Q, epistemic  indistinguishability relations ∼a⊆ Q × Q (one per agent), and a valuation of propositions π : Π → P(Q).
a sequence q0q1 ... such that q = q0 and there are q0 , ... , qi such that q0 ... qi q0q1 ... ∈ ΛM.2 The semantics of CTLK is defined as
