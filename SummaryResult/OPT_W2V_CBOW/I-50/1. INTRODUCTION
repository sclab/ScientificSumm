In our approach, plausibility can be seen as a temporal property of behaviors.
In this paper, we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior: this notion is added to the language of CTLK [19], which is a  straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5].
Our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that  allows the study of strategies, time, knowledge, and  plausible/rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect  information.
In  Section 4, properties of knowledge, belief, and plausibility are explored.
