We add the new notion of plausibility to the logic of CTLK [19], and obtain a language which  enables reasoning about what can (or must) plausibly happen.
We use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates.
We also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility  update operator (in a way similar to [13]).
In particular, we show that knowledge is an S5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general, and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models.
In this paper a notion of
