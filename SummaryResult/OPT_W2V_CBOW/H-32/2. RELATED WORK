Predominantly, this approach has been used as a backup method for identifying definitional sentences when the primary method of  lexicalosyntactic patterns failed to find a sufficient number of  informative nuggets [1].
Still, relevance based retrieval methods can be used as a starting point in identifying interesting nuggets.
Systems can then use this centroid to identify definitional  answers by using a variety of distance metrics to compare against  sentences found in the set of retrieved documents for the topic.
