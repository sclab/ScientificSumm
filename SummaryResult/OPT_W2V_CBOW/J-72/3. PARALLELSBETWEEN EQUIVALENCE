Since revealing Lindahl prices is a necessary condition for establishing an optimal allocation, and since Lindahl prices contain the same  information as valuation functions (in the worst-case), allowing for dependence on size(v1, .
The agent"s manifest valuations are in fact valid Lindahl prices, and we refer to them as maximal Lindahl prices.
We say that the Lindahl prices support the optimal allocation.
Thus demand  queries can also implicitly communicate manifest valuations, since Lindahl prices will typically be an additive constant away from these by equality (4).
Considering now why demand and equivalence queries are direct analogs , first
