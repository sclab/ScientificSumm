Our result allows us to apply the wealth of available learning algorithms to the problem of preference elicitation.
At the heart of this result is the fact that demand queries may be viewed as modified equivalence queries,  specialized to the problem of preference elicitation.
In the learning setting, we usually assume that oracles will provide honest responses to queries; in the  elicitation setting, agents are usually selfish and will provide possibly dishonest responses so as to maximize their utility.
This is the  preference elicitation problem.
We have shown that exact learning algorithms with membership and equivalence queries can be used
