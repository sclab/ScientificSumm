Thus the value and demand queries, and the  responses to these queries, are always of polynomial size.
If the learning algorithm"s equivalence  queries are all proper, it may then also be possible to provide tight bounds on the communication requirements of the  resulting elicitation algorithm.
Thus communicating the manifest valuation requires size at most p(size(vi), m), for some polynomial p that upper-bounds the runtime of the efficient learning algorithm.
Nisan and Segal [ 12 ] show that for a variety of rich valuation spaces ( such as general and submodular valuations ) , the worst-case communication
