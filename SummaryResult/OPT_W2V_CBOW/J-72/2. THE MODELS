To make an analogy to computational learning theory, we assume that all representation classes considered are  polynomially interpretable [11], meaning that the value of a bundle may be computed in polynomial time given the valuation function"s representation.
, Vn can be polynomial-query elicited from value and demand queries if there is a fixed polynomial p(·, ·) and an  algorithm L with access to value and demand queries of the agents such that for any (v1, .
We have dropped the term exactly since the valuation functions need not be determined exactly in order to compute an optimal allocation.
