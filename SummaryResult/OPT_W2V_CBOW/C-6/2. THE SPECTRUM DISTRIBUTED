A key aspect of the policy manager is that it allows different policies to be simultaneously applied to the same content (or parts of the same content).
Finally, the storage manager also has a discard routine that may be used by the policy manager to inform the store to remove content from the store. 
The higher-level reasons for choosing a given policy are handled by the content and application manager.
The need for this sort of separation might occur for scalability reasons or when different specialized storage devices or appliances are required to be controlled by a single policy manager
