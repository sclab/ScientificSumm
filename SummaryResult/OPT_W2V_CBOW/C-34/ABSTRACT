Furthermore, the working performance of the newly proposed pairwise key establishment algorithm is seriously inspected.
By utilizing nice properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, a new general framework for pairwise key predistribution and a new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed, which combines the idea of KDC(Key Distribution Center) and polynomial pool schemes.
Theoretic analysis and experimental figures show that the new algorithm has better performance and provides higher possibilities for sensor to establish pairwise key, compared with previous related works.
Security schemes of pairwise key establishment , which enable sensors to communicate with each other
