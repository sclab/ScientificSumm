So according to the theorem 1, we can know that nodes A, I1,…,It-1, B form a correct key path between node A and B.
If any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series A, I1,…,It-1, B can communicate directly, then node A can establish indirect pairwise key with node B through those t-1 intermediate nodes.
If d=1 , then node A obtains the direct pairwise key between itself and node B according to the following theorem 1 : Theorem 1 : For any two sensor nodes A ( i1i2…in , j1j2…jm ) and B ( i'1i'2…i'n
