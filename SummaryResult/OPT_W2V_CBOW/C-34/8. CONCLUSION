The new algorithm uses the good characteristics of node codes and high fault-tolerance of H(k,u,m,v,n) model to route and predistribute pairwise keys, in which nodes are not needed to be able to communicate with each other directly such as that the algorithms proposed by [7] shall need.
And Based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model, an innovative pairwise key predistribution scheme and algorithm are designed respectively, by combing the good properties of the Polynomial Key and Key Pool encryption schemes.
So , the traditional pairwise key predistribution algorithm based on hypercube model
