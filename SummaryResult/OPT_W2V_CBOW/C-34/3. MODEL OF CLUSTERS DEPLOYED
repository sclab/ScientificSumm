Supposing that the sensors form a connected graph in any cluster after deployment through airplanes, and then the Fig.1 presents an actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks.
Supposing that the deployment rounds of sensors are k, and the communication radius of any sensors is r, then the sensors deployed in the same round can be regarded as belonging to a same Cluster.
From Figure.1 , it is easy to know that , for a given node A , there exist lots of nodes in the same cluster of A , which can be communicated directly with A , since
