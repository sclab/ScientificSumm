Theorem 6: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor network, and the fraction of compromised nodes is pc, then when u>v, the number of affected nodes of the H(v,p) model based key predistribution scheme, is bigger than that of the H(k,u,m,v,n) model based key predistribution scheme.
Since u > v ⇒ x > m ⇒ pc ××N ( m+n ) < pc ××N ( x+n ) = pc ××N p. Supposing that the scale of the sensor network is N=10000 , Figure.7 presents the comparison between pc and the
