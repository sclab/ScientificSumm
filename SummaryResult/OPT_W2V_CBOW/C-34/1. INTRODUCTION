In this paper, we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution model of sensor networks, and for which, we propose a new pairwise key pre-distribution scheme.
The analysis shows that hypercube-based scheme keeps some attractive properties of the grid-based scheme, including the guarantee of establishing pairwise keys and the resilience to node compromises.
Though hypercube-based scheme (we consider the grid-based scheme is a special case of hypercube-based scheme) has many attractive properties, it requires any two nodes in sensor networks can communication directly with each other.
All of those schemes above improve the security over the basic probabilistic key pre-distribution
