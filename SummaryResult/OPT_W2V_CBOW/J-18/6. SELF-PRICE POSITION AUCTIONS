The proof in this example can be easily generalized to show that the VCG outcome function can be implemented by a valid  mediator in a self-price position auction, in which there is one position and an arbitrary number of players, n â‰¥ 2.
Hence, no mediator can implement the VCG outcome function in G.2 The proof of Theorem 6 heavily uses the fixed priority rule assumption.
There is no mediator that  implements the VCG outcome function in G. Proof.
In order to implement such an outcome , a mediator must bid 5 on behalf of player n ( so that
