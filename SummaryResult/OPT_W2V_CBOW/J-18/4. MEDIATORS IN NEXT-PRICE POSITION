We first show it for s(v, i) = 1, that is δ(v, 1) = i.
We define a mediator m, which will implement the VCG outcome function in G: For every v ∈ V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is defined as follows: For every player i such that 2 ≤ s(v, i) ≤ m let bi(v) = pvcg s(v,i)−1(v).8 For every i ∈ δ(v, m + 1), bi(v) = pvcg m (v).
That is v ( j+1 ) = vi , and therefore by the second part of Lemma 1
