We next provide the construction of the valid mediator, which will implement the VCG outcome function in a position  auction G, which satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3: Algorithm for building m for G: • For every v ∈ V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is some bid profile such that ϕG (b(v)) = ϕvcg (v) • For every i and for every v−i ∈ V−i, let vi = (v−i, M(v−i)), where M(v−i) = 1 + maxj=ivj.
There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G if and only if the following two conditions hold : (
