Assume both 7 Actually, it can be shown that if a strategy profile b in a position auction is an ex post equilibrium then for every player i bi is a dominant strategy.
A mediator for G is valid, if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a  nonnegative level of utility.
We define a family of mediators mc , c â‰¥ 1, each of them implements the VCG position auction.
Indeed, assume player 2 reports his type v2 to the mediator, and consider player 1.
FUNCTION BY MEDIATION In general , except for the VCG position auction we do not
