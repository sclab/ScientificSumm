That is, bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and only if i < k. Given this fixed priority rule we can make the following definitions, which apply to all position auctions: We denote by s(b, i) the position player i is assigned to when the bid profile is b.
Hence, the action set of player i in the mediated game is Bi ∪Vi, where conveniently Vi denotes both, (0, ∞) , and a copy of (0, ∞), which is disjoint from 6 We use the standard payment function of the VCG  mechanism.
It is useful to define
