One of their approaches, called the tail game, is related to the reverse rule of Chun [1].
A key axiom that we introduce gives us a bound on cost share of a job in a group of jobs which have the same ratio of unit time waiting cost and  processing time (these jobs can be ordered in any manner between themseleves in an efficient ordering).
We also extend the envy results in [2] to our setting and discuss a class of reasonable cost sharing mechanisms. 
First best implementation means that there exists an efficient mechanism in which jobs in the
