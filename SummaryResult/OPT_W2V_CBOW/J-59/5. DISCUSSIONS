For adjusted  noenvy, if (σ, t) is an allocation for some q ∈ Q, let tij be the 237 transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with respect to ordering σij .
Any efficient and reasonable allocation rule ψ that satisfies ETE is a rule implied by the Shapley value rule.
As before denote σij be an ordering where the position of i and j is swapped from an ordering σ.
An allocation rule satisfies no-envy if for all q ∈ Q , ( σ , t ) ∈ ψ ( q ) , and i ,
