Consider any job i, in an efficient ordering σ, if we increase the value of γj for some j = i such that σj > σi, then the set Pi ( preceding jobs) does not change in the new efficient ordering.
Using this argument for every i ∈ N and using the expression for the Shapley value in Lemma 3, we get the Shapley value rule.
By ECB and Lemma 4 the cost share of job i + 1 in any allocation rule in ψ must be πi+1 = pi+1θi+1 + 1 2 ¡£j<i+1 pjθi+1¢.
This gives us the Shapley values of jobs i through
