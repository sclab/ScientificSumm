Some initial simplifications already appear in [16], where we provide an alternative axiom to ECB and also discuss the implication of transfers between jobs (in stead of transfers from jobs to a central server).
Investigating the strategic power of jobs in such mechanisms is another line of future research. 
In future, we plan to further simplify some of the fairness axioms.
We also plan to look at cost sharing mechanisms other than the Shapley value.
We took a cooperative game theory approach and show that the famous the  Shapley value rule satisfies many nice fairness properties.
We studied the problem
