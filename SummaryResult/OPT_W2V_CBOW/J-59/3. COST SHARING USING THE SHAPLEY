Formally, the cost of a coalition S ⊆ N is, C(S) =   i∈S   j∈S:σ∗ j ≤σ∗ i θjpj, where σ∗ = σ∗ (S) is an efficient ordering considering jobs from S only.
For |S| = 3, let S = {i, j, k}.
This gives ∆({i}) = C({i}) = piθi ∀i ∈ N. For any i, j ∈ N with i = j, we have ∆({i, j}) = C({i, j}) − C({i}) − C({j}) = min(piθi + pjθj + pjθi, piθi + pjθj + piθj) − piθi − pjθj = min(pjθi, piθj).
