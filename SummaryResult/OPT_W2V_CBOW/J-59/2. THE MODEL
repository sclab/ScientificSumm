σ : N → N is an ordering of jobs in N and σi denotes the position of job i in the ordering σ.
An allocation for q = (N, p, θ) ∈ Q has two components: an ordering σ and a transfer ti for every job i ∈ N. ti denotes the payment received by job i.
If σ∗ = σ be an efficient ordering and t∗ i = ci(σ∗ ) − πi ∀ i ∈ N, then (σ∗ , t∗ ) is also an efficient allocation.
Since σ∗ is an efficient ordering, £i∈N ci(σ∗ ) = C(N).
For any S ⊆ N , let
