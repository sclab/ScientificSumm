The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .
Then, the total cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )], and the total payoff of all the moves is equal to the payoff of the single move [(x, y) → (x , y )].
Note , the potential is positive for x off the positive
