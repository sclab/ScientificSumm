Although stated for  logscoring rules, the theorem holds for any scoring rules that induce a potential with a unique local and global minimum at p, such as the quadratic scoring rule and others. 
Similarly to the projection game, define the profit potential of a probability r in MSR to be the change in profit for moving from r to the optimum p, φMSR(s(r), p) = profitMSR[s(r), s(p)].
Consider the projection game restricted to the non-negative unit circle where strategies x have the natural one-to-one correspondence to probability distributions r = ( r , 1 − r
