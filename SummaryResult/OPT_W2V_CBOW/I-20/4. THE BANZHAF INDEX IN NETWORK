Let Ec ⊂ E be a subset of edges that is a perfect matching in G. Then the maximal flow between s and t using only the edges in Ec is exactly k. PROOF.
In all of this section , we take the input to the # MATCHING problem to be G = < U , V , E > with |U| = |V | = k , the network flow graph constructed in the reduction to be G = < V , E > with capacities c : E → R as defined in Section 4.3 , the edge
