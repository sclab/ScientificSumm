The Shapley-Shubik index [19] is the direct application of the Shapley value to simple coalitional games.
Since the number of possible coalitions is exponential in the number of agents,  calculating power indices in time polynomial in the number of agents can only be achieved in specific domains.
Matsui and Matsui [13] have shown that calculating both the Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices in weighted voting games is NP-complete.
In his seminal paper, Shapley [18] considered coalitional games and the fair allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition (the coalition of all agents) to its members.
Since the Shapley value
