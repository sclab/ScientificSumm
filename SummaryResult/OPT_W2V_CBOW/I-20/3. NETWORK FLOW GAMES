Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i âˆˆ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.
When a coalition of edges
