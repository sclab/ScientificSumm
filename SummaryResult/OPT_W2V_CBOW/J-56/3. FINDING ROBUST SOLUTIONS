Backtracking may then occur for one of two reasons: we cannot extend the assignment to satisfy the given constraints, or the current  partial assignment cannot be associated with a repair solution whose cost of repair is less than Î² should a break occur.
The procedure reparable searches for partial repair solutions using  backtracking and attempts to extend the last repair found, just as in  (1,b)super solutions [9]; the differences being that a repair is provided for a set of breakage variables rather than a single variable and the cost of repair is considered.
