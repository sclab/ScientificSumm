An analysis of the resultant behavior of  bidders must incorporate the possibility of a bidder winning an item and having it withdrawn in order for the bid-taker to formulate a repair solution after a break elsewhere.
In this manner the least brittle solution of adequate revenue may be chosen. 
In the case where no robust solutions are found, it is possible to optimize robustness, instead of revenue, by finding a solution of at least a given revenue that minimizes the probability of an  irreparable break.
Harstad and Rothkopf have analyzed bidder aggressiveness [ 8 ] using a strictly game-theoretic model
