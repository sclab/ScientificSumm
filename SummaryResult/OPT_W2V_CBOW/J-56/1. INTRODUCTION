We have called this the Bid-taker"s Exposure Problem that bears similarities to the Exposure  Problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items.
In terms of combinatorial auctions, a robust solution is one that can  withstand bid withdrawal (a break) by making changes easily to form a repair solution of adequate revenue.
Revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such  auctions, but another desirable attribute is solution robustness.
We then propose an auction model in Section 4 that enhances reparability by introducing mandatory
