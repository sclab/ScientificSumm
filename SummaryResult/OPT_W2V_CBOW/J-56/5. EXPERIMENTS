The revenues of repair  solutions are bounded by at least 90% of the optimum in our  experiments thereby allowing a direct comparison with robust solutions already found using the same revenue constraint but not providing for backtracking.
A notable side-effect of robust solutions is that fewer bids  participate in the solutions.
It can be clearly seen from Table 4 that when revenue constraints on repair solutions are tight, there are fewer winning bids in the optimal robust solution on average.
The numbers in brackets are derived from the sensitivity analysis of optimal solutions that reveals the fact that almost all
