The strategies for each player  (security agent or robber) in the transformed game correspond to all combinations of possible strategies taken by each of that player"s types.
Using these values we construct a base payoff table as the payoff for the game against robber type a.
Since there are two types assumed (denoted as a and b), we construct two payoff tables (shown in Table 2) corresponding to the security agent playing a separate game with each of the two robber types with probabilities α and 1 − α.
Given the common assumption , taken in [ 5
