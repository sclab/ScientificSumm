The problem of choosing an optimal strategy for the leader to commit to in a Stackelberg game is analyzed in [5] and found to be NP-hard in the case of a Bayesian game with multiple types of followers.
In addition, since the Nash equilibrium assumes a simultaneous choice of strategies, the advantages of being the leader are not considered.
Section 3 introduces the Bayesian game, the Harsanyi transformation, and existing methods for finding an optimal leader"s strategy in a  Stackelberg game.
To see the advantage of being the leader in a Stackelberg game , consider a simple game
