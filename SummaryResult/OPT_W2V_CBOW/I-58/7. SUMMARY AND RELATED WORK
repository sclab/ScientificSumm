This contrasts with ASAP, where our emphasis is on a highly efficient heuristic approach that is not focused on equilibrium solutions.
Second, it provides  strategies which are simple to understand, represent, and implement.
Finally the patrolling problem which motivated our work has  recently received growing attention from the multiagent community due to its wide range of applications [4, 13].
