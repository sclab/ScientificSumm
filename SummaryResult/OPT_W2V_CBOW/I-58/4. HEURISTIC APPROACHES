(3) From strong duality and complementary slackness we obtain that the follower"s maximum reward value, a, is the value of every pure strategy with qj > 0, that is in the support of the optimal mixed strategy.
We will show that q, zij = xiqj is a feasible solution of (6) of same objective function value.
( 4 ) Problem ( 4 ) maximizes the leader '' s reward with the follower '' s best response ( qj for fixed leader '' s policy x and hence denoted q ( x ) j ) by selecting a uniform policy from
