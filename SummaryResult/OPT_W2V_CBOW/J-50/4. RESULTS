We observe that this fooling set has size (2m )n = 2n m , and that candidate a wins in each vector of votes in the fooling set (a is approved by 2n + 1 voters, whereas each other candidate is approved by only 2n voters).
If candidate c was the ith candidate to be eliminated ( that is , there were m − i + 1 candidates remaining before c '' s elimination ) , it follows that at most n/ ( m − i + 1 ) voters had candidate c as their most preferred candidate among the remaining candidates ,
