For the purposes of this paper, we will consider a nondeterministic protocol correct if for every input vector, there is some  sequence of nondeterministic choices the players can make so that the players know the value of f when the protocol  terminates.
For example, for  every one of our lower bounds it is the case that for infinitely many values of m, there are infinitely many values of n such that the lower bound is proved for the pair (m, n). 
Nevertheless, we always prove the lower bound for a representative set of (m, n) pairs.
This will strengthen our
