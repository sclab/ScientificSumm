That is one of the point where our system still has to be improved by adding another set of rules.
Then , the non cooperation degree μ ( A ) of agent A is : μ ( A ) = max ( μH ( A ) , μB ( A ) , μM ( A ) ) ( 4 ) Then , we have three cases determining which kind of action A will choose : • if μ ( A ) = μH ( A ) then A will use the head coverage algorithm we detailed in the previous subsection
