That is why a system like ASIUM [6] tries to soften the problem with a system-user collaboration by showing to the ontologist the created classes after each step of reasoning.
Indeed, the hierarchy created by the system is meant to be modified by the ontologist since it is the result of a statistic  computation.
Because of this, the similarity computations are done twice for each agent pair.
It is bootstrapped in the following way : • a TOP agent having no parent is created , it will be the root of the resulting taxonomy , • an agent is created
