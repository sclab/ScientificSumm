In our work, we propose an interaction between the ontologist and the system, our external resource lies both in the texts and the ontologist.
Our aim is not to build an exhaustive, general hierarchical ontology but a domain specific one.
They"re sometimes used to ease the  ontology building process, in particular for collaborative contexts [3], but they rarely represent the ontology itself [16].
Then, in section 3 we discuss the  distributed clustering algorithm used in Dynamo and compare it to a more classic centralized approach.
Our research focuses on Dynamo ( an acronym of DYNAMic Ontologies ) ,
