After being presented as a promising solution, ensuring model quality and their terminological richness, ontology building from textual corpus analysis is difficult and costly.
The current state of our software allows to produce simple structures, to propose them to the ontologist and to make them evolve depending on the  modifications he made.
Our system makes use of a terminological network  resulting from an analysis made by Syntex.
This  dynamic ontologies can be seen as complex problem solving, in such a case self-organization through cooperation has been an efficient solution.
Of course , our system still requires more evaluation and validation
