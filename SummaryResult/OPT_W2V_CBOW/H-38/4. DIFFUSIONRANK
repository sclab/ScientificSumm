(6) in the case of a random graph, in which f(0) is set to be a special initial heat  distribution so that the trusted Web pages have unit heat while all the others have zero heat.
Formally the DiffusionRank is described in  Algorithm 1, in which,the element Uij in the inverse transition matrix U is defined to be 1/Ij if there is a link from i to j, and 0 otherwise.
For such f(0) in a random graph, we can find the heat distribution at time 1 by using Eq.
By such a setting , DiffusionRank is
