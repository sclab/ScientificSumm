By this normalization, we can  compare the results on graphs with different sizes since the  average rank value is one for any graph after such normalization.
After these investigations, we find that in all the graphs we tested, DiffusionRank (when Î³ = 1) is most robust to  manipulation both in value difference and order difference.
3 stand for the numbers of newly added points, and vertical axes show the corresponding rank values of the  manipulated nodes.
In each sub-figure, the trusted sets are  computed below.
