In such a random graph, the expected heat difference at node i between time t + âˆ†t and time t will be equal to the sum of the expected heat that it receives from all its antecedents, deducted by the expected heat that it diffuses.
As a result, heat flows in a one-way manner, only from a to b, not from b to a.
Note that every static graph can be considered as a special  random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1.
The graph is considered as an approximation to the underlying manifold , and
