Otherwise, if the probability of delivering the message to its destination through this receiver node within Î”T is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, the message is stored in the receiver"s storage to forward 1 In our simulation, however, we accurately model the  communication costs and some short contacts will not succeed in transfer of all messages.
When two nodes meet, they exchange a meta-message,  containing an unordered list of node IDs for which the sender of the  metamessage has a contact probability greater than the threshold.
