Many routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to address the problem, but few were evaluated in a realistic opportunistic  network setting.
We use simulation and contact traces (derived from logs in a production network) to evaluate and compare five  existing protocols: direct-delivery, epidemic, random, PRoPHET, and Link-State, as well as our own proposed routing protocol.
Traditional mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) routing protocols  assume that contemporaneous end-to-end communication paths exist between data senders and receivers.
In some mobile ad-hoc networks with a sparse node population , an end-to-end communication path may break frequently or may not exist at any
