[15] use a high-dimensional space to represent a mobility pattern, then routes messages to nodes that are closer to the destination node in the mobility pattern space.
When two nodes are in the same connected cloud, DSDV [19] routing is used.
If m of the blocks are received at the  destination, the message can be restored, where m < k. In a uniformly distributed mobility scenario, the delivery probability increases  because the probability that the destination node meets m relays is greater than it meets k relays, given m < k.
