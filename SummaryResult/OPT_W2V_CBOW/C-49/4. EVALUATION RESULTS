For direct delivery, random, and the probability-based routing protocols, relatively few messages were delivered for short TTLs, so many messages expired before they could reach their destination; those messages had infinite delivery delay and were not included in the median or mean measurements.
The direct and random protocols for one-hour TTL had delivery ratios that were too low to be visible in the plot.
Indeed, the figures show only the delay time for delivered messages.
Obviously, the direct delivery protocol had the lowest number of message transmissions - the number of message delivered.
