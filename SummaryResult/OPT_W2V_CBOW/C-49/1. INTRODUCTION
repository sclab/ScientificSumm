To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic network, using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of a production network with more than 5, 000 users.
Mobile  opportunistic networks differ from the Internet in that disconnections are the norm instead of the exception.
In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people.
One fundamental problem in opportunistic networks is how to route messages from their source to their destination.
Opportunistic networking is one promising approach for those children
