A node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.
The message has some chance of  being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires.
Nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight.
DTN routing protocols could be described in part by their transfer probability and replication probability ; that is , when one node meets another node , what is the probability
