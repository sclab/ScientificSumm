The prediction-based  routing protocols had a delivery ratio more than 10 times better than that for direct-delivery and random routing, and fewer  transmissions and less storage usage than epidemic routing.
All the prediction-based routing protocols that we have  evaluated had similar performance.
Indeed, there is an opportunity for some adaptation; for example, high priority messages may be given higher transfer and  replication probabilities to increase the chance of delivery and reduce the delay, or a node with infrequent contact may choose to raise its transfer probability.
None of these protocols ( direct-delivery , random and epidemic routing ) are practical
