Within the energy exploration strategic application area, we have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [7] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the TIGRE environment and the GridWay [8] metascheduler.
The secondary goal is to demonstrate the TIGRE capabilities to enhance research and educational opportunities in strategic application areas of interest to the State of Texas.
Application description and the need for Grid-enabling EnKF methodology is provided in Section 3.
The purpose of TIGRE is to create a higher education Grid to sustain and extend research and educational opportunities across Texas
