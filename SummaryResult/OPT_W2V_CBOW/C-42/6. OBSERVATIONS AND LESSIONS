Since the reservoir modeling research involves proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial efforts initially in educating the application researchers on the ability of Grid services in supporting the industry standard data security through role- and privilege-based access using X.509 standard.
The main issues are industry standard data security and QoS comparable to cluster computing.
LEARNED The Grid-enabling efforts for EnKF application have provided ample opportunities to gather insights on the visibility and promise of Grid computing environments for application development and support.
This approach also helps users to match their applications and abilities Grids can offer
