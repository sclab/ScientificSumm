In this approach, the geological models are treated as slaves and are distributed across the available processors.
The simulation runtime of the EnKF methodology depends on the number of geological models used, number of ECLIPSE licenses available, production history of the field, and propagated uncertainties in history matching.
Since each geological model checks out an ECLIPSE license, parallelizability of the simulation depends on the number of licenses available.
When the available number of licenses is less than the number of models in the ensemble , one or more of the nodes in the MPI group have to handle more than
