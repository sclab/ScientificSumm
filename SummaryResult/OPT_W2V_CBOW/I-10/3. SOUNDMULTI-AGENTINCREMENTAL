A positive example of f, like {not − a, b, not − c}, represents a model for f. 3.2 Incremental learning process The learning process is an update mechanism that, given a current hypothesis H, a memory E = E+ ∪ E− filled with the previously received examples, and a new positive or negative example e, produces a new updated  hypothesis.
Terms of the final hypothesis H that are less general than others are discarded from H. We will now describe the case where e = e− is a covered negative example.
In the following , a hypothesis H for the target
