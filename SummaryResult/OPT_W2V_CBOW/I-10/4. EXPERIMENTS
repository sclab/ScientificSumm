We think that these benefits, which can be important with an increasing number of agents, are due to the fact that each agent really  memorizes only part of the total number of examples, and this part is partly selected by other agents as counter examples, which cause a greater number of current hypothesis updates and therefore, a better exploration of the hypotheses space.
Therefore, this first contradictory example brings the MAS to reach consistency relatively to the whole set of examples present in agents" memories.
After 1450 examples have been presented both 1-MAS and 10-MAS have exactly learned the
