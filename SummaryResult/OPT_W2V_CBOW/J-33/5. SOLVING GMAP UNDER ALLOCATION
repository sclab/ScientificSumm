For example, if sellers submit bounded sets of XOR points, we only need to consider the points in the  combined set offered by the sellers, and the reduction to network flow is polynomial regardless of the number of homogeneous attributes.
A match in our bipartite representation corresponds to a  potential trade in which assignment constraints are satisfied.
Therefore, the next generalization allows any combination of the two boolean constraints, that is, any trader chooses among four bid types: NI Bid AON and not aggregating.
For the divisible case , the distinguished quantities are those where the unit price changes ,
