The Multiattribute Matching  Problem (MMP) is to find a best trade for a given pair of traders, MMP(b, s) = arg max t∈OT b ∩OT s σ(t).
Divisibility, linear pricing, and configuration parity  (Definitions 1, 10, and 9), with combination offer set defined as the minimal set consistent with configuration aggregation  (Definition 6).2 Then the solution to GMAP consists of a set of trades, each of which employs a configuration that solves MMP for its specified pair of traders.
Let MMPd ( b , s ) denote a modified version of MMP , where OT b and OT
