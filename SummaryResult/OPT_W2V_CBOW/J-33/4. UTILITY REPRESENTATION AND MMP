A key point from our perspective is that the complexity of the matching is similar to the complexity of optimizing a single  function, since the sum function is in the form (2) as well.
First, as noted above, the theory is developed for utility functions, which may behave  differently from willingness-to-pay functions.
The complexity of MMP depends pivotally on the representation by bids of offer sets, an issue we have  postponed to this point.
Associating a single quantity and payment with a set of configurations expresses indifference among them ; hence we refer to such a set as an indifference
