In particular, we use the framework to  explore tradeoffs between expressive power of agent bids and  computational properties of auction clearing.
Constructing an optimal overall matching may require consideration of many different  combina1 In the interim between clears, call markets may also disseminate price quotes providing summary information about the state of the auction [24].
As with analogous studies of combinatorial auctions [18], we intend that tradeoffs quantified in this work can be combined with incentive factors within a comprehensive overall approach to multiattribute auction design.
In a call market , in contrast , bids accumulate until designated times (
