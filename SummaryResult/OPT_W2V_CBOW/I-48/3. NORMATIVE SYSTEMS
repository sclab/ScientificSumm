Thus K † (η C) is the Kripke structure that results if only the agents in C choose to comply with the normative system.
• η C denotes the normative system that is the same as η  except that it only contains the arcs of η that do not correspond to actions of agents in C. We call η C the exclusion of C from η, and it is defined as: η C = {(s, s ) : (s, s ) ∈ η & α(s, s ) ∈ C}.
Formally , let K = S , S0 , R , A , α , V
