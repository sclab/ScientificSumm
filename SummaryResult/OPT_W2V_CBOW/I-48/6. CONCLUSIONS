We have proposed a logical framework to reason about such scenarios, and we have given some computational costs for settling some of the main  questions about them.
And, for a system designer, how to be sure that the system will behave socially, that is, according to its norm.
The question then, for an agent is, how to be sure that others will comply with a norm.
An obvious issue is to consider is the complexity of the questions we give for more practical  representations of models (cf.
Game theory is a very natural tool to analyse and answer these questions
