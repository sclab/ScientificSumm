Though the algorithms for  accomplishing such an arrangement are legion, our analysis focuses on k-means clustering5 , during which, each  observation oi is assigned to the cluster Ck whose centroid is closest to it, in terms of Euclidean distance.
In consultation with employees of the BLS, we continued our analysis on documents that form a series titled From the Editor"s Desk6 .
In future work we will turn to model-based clustering [7] as a more principled method of selecting the number of clusters and of representing clusters.
It also allowed the clustering process to learn on a relatively clean data
