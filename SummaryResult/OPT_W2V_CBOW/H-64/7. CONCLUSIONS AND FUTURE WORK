However, we also found evidence that learning topics from a subset of the collection may lead to overfitted models.
Instead of clustering documents to find topics and then fitting a model to the learned clusters, our goal is to expand the unsupervised portion of our analysis beyond a narrow subset of the collection, such as The Editor"s Desk.
As we have argued in this paper, these methods may also be brought to bear on the design and implementation of advanced user interfaces.
While it is not surprising that editor-generated keywords should give strong evidence for such learning ,
