To use these weights in the relation browser we currently assign to each document the two topics on which it scored highest.
Also, evaluation of the utility of the learned topics for users will be undertaken. 
Specifically, using k-means, we clustered each of the 1279  documents into one of k clusters, with the number of clusters chosen by analyzing the within-cluster mean squared  distance at different values of k (see Section 6.1).
They define a  decision boundary by finding the maximally separating  hyperplane in a high-dimensional vector space in which document classes become linearly separable.
The output of this process
