In general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case of RBR is the efficient value). 
We first studied the short-run setting with incomplete information, corresponding to the case where agents have just approached the mechanism.
We also studied the long-run case where agents have experimented with their bids and each settled on one they find optimal.
We hope that the tools we used to establish these results ( revenue equivalence , the
