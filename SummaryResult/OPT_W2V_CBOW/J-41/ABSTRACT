In this paper we analyze the  incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of two slot  auction designs: rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), which correspond to stylized versions of the  mechanisms currently used by Yahoo!

We also consider first- and second-price payment rules  together with each of these allocation rules, as both have been used historically.
We show that
