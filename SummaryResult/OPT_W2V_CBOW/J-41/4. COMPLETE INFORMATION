Since xσ(i) ≤ xσ(j) for i > j, the system of inequalities in Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the allocation is the result of some Nash equilibrium bid profile.
Since this holds for any two consecutive bidders, it follows that in a Nash equilibrium all bidders must be bidding 0 (since the bidder ranked last matches the bid directly below him, which is 0 by default because there is no such bid).
By the same type of argument but appealing to Lemma 2 for RBR , there exists a Nash equilibrium bid profile such that bidders are ranked according
