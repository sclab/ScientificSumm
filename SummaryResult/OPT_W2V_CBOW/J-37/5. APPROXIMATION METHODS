Also, for any feasible solution to the LP, we can get bounds on the quality of the strategies by examining the primal and dual solutions.
(When using the primal simplex method, dual solutions may be read off of the LP tableau.)
(A  variation of this technique may also be applied in n-person games where only one player"s strategies are held fixed.)
Thus , with this threshold as a parameter , we have a knob to turn that in one extreme ( threshold = 0 ) yields an optimal abstraction and in the other extreme ( threshold = âˆž
