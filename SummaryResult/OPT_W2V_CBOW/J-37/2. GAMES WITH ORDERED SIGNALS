By an abuse of notation, we will say player i receives an expected payoff of ui(σ) when all players are playing the strategy profile σ.
Each signal θ ∈ Θ may only be revealed once, and in each round every player receives the same number of private signals, so we  require Pr j=1 κj + nγj ≤ |Θ|.
, n} is a finite set of players.
A behavior strategy for player i in round j is σj i = (σj i,v1 , .
The private information revealed to player i ∈ I in round j is βj i ∈ Θγj and the private
