That game tree size has required us to use the approximation version of GameShrink (as well as round-based abstraction) [16, 15].
It is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller, so GameShrink has time and space complexity sublinear in 8 Bridge is also a game of imperfect information, and partition search does not find the equilibrium for that game either.
Using GameShrink , we found a minimax equilibrium to Rhode Island Hold '' em , a poker game with 3.1 billion nodes in the game tree-over four orders of magnitude more than in
