By evaluating this dynamic program from bottom to top, Algorithm 1 determines, in time polynomial in the size of the signal tree, whether or not any pair of equal depth nodes x and y are ordered game isomorphic.
Once it finishes, there are no contractible nodes (since it compares every pair of nodes at each level of the signal tree), and it outputs the corresponding information filter F. The correctness of GameShrink follows by a repeated application of Theorem 2.
In general , if an ordered game has r rounds , and each round '' s stage game has at
