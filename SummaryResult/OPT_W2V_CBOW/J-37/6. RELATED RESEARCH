However, a significant difference to our work is that Sprouts is a game of perfect information.
However, it is not game theory-based (it does not consider information sets in the game tree), and thus does not solve for the equilibrium of a game of  imperfect information, such as poker.8 Another difference is that the abstraction is defined by an expert human while our abstractions are determined automatically.
There has been some research on the use of abstraction for imperfect information games.
One of the first pieces of research to use abstraction in multi-agent settings was the development of partition search
