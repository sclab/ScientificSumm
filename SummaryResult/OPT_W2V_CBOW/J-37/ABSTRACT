Finding an equilibrium of an extensive form game of  imperfect information is a fundamental problem in computational game theory, but current techniques do not scale to large games.
Using GameShrink, we find an equilibrium to a poker game with 3.1 billion nodes-over four orders of magnitude more than in the largest poker game solved previously.
For a multi-player sequential game of imperfect information with observable actions and an ordered signal space , we prove that any Nash equilibrium in an abstracted smaller game , obtained by one or more applications of the transformation , can be easily converted into a
