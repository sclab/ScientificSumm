It is easy to check that in the  abstracted game (where Player 1 treats J1 and J2 as being equivalent) the Nash equilibrium does not correspond to a Nash equilibrium in the original game.7
Associated with every ordered game Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u and information filter F is a  filtered signal tree, a directed tree in which each node  corresponds to some revealed (filtered) signals and edges  correspond to revealing specific (filtered) signals.
Let σ be a Nash equilibrium of the induced game ΓF .
The payment from player 2 to player 1 is given
