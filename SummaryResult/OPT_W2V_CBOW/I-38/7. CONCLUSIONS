With this auction, we can even envision completely eliminating the auctioneer and, instead, have  every agent performe the task of the auctioneer.
We believe that distributed solutions to the winner  determination problem should be studied as they offer a better fit for some applications as when, for example, agents do not want to reveal their valuations to the auctioneer or when we wish to distribute the computational load among the bidders.
As expected the revenue generated by a PAUSE auction is lower than the revenue of a revenue-maximizing solution found by a centralized winner determination algorithm , however we found
