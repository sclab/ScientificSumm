Notice also that our value generation algorithm (Figure 5) generates a number of bids that is exponential on the number of items, as might be expected in many situations.
As such, these results do not support the conclusion that time grows  exponentially with the number of items when the number of bids is independent of the number of items.
The first experiment we performed simply ensured the proper 1 Note that we could not use CATS [6] because it generates sets of bids for an indeterminate number of agents.
We fixed the number of agents to be 5 and we
