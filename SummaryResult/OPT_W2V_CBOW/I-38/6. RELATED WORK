One approach is given by the algorithms for distributing the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions presented in [7], but these algorithms assume the  computational entities are the items being sold and thus end up with a different type of distribution.
However, the study of distributed winner determination  algorithms for combinatorial auctions is still relatively new.
The VSA algorithm [3] is another way of performing distributed winner  determination in combinatorial auction but it assumes the bids themselves perform the computation.
This algorithm also fails to converge to a solution for most cases.
Another interesting approach is given in [ 8
