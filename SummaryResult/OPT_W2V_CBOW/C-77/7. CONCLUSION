Interestingly, it has also been shown that the efficiency of the protocols (measured in terms of the size of the control information that is not piggybacked by an application  message) depends on the pattern defined by the communication events and the relevant events.
According to the way the general condition is implemented,  different IPT protocols can be obtained.
The resulting protocols, that implement a vector clock system, are particularly efficient as far as the size of the timestamp carried by each message is concerned.
Interestingly , this efficiency is not obtained at the price of additional assumptions ( such as
