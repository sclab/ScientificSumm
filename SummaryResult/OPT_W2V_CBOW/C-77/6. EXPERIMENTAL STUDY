From these figures, we observe that, whatever the time distribution  followed by the relevant events, both IPT2 and IPT3 exhibit a behavior better than IPT1 (i.e., the total number of  piggybacked triples is lower in IPT2 and IPT3 than in IPT1), even in the worst case (see Figure 3.d).
On the other hand, when very few relevant events are  taken in a large period of time (see Figure 3.c), the behavior of IPT2 and IPT3 turns out to be very efficient since the  transmission of up to 92% of the triples is saved.
The figure shows that , as soon
