Let K (m, k) be an approximation of K(m, k), that can be evaluated by a process Pi when it sends a message m. To be correct, the condition K must ensure that, every time Pi should  transmit a triple (k, V Ci[k], IPi[k]) according to Theorem 2 (i.e., each time Â¬K(m, k)), then Pi transmits this triple when it uses condition K .
Differently , the matrix Mi does not belong to the problem specification , it is an auxiliary variable of the IPT protocol , which manages it so as to satisfy the following implication
