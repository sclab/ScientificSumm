If e is the first event produced by Pi, then pred(e) is denoted by ⊥ (meaning that there is no such event), and ∀e ∈ Hi : ⊥ < e. The partial order bH = (H, hb →)  constitutes a formal model of the distributed computation it is associated with.
The sequence of relevant events produced by process Pi is denoted by Ri, and R = ∪n i=1Ri ⊆ H denotes the set of all relevant events.
The following properties relate the events lastr(e, j) and lastr(f, j) for all the predecessors f of e in the relation hb →.
