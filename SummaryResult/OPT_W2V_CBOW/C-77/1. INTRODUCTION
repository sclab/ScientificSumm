In this paper, we are interested in the restriction of the causality relation to the subset of events defined as being the relevant events of the computation.
Usually, according to the problem he focuses on, a  designer is interested only in a subset of the events produced by a distributed execution (e.g., only the checkpoint events are meaningful when one is interested in determining  consistent global checkpoints [12]).
More precisely , given two events e and f of a distributed computation , a crucial problem that has to be solved in a lot of distributed applications is to know whether
