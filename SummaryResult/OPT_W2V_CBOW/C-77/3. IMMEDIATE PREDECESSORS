The intuitive meaning of the next lemma is the following: if e is a receive event receive(m), and pred(e) is not  relevant, the last relevant events in the relevant causal past of e are obtained by merging those of pred(e) and those of send(m) and by taking the latest on each process.
The intuitive meaning of the first lemma is the following: if e is not a receive event, all the causal paths arriving at e have pred(e) as next-to-last event (see CP1).
First , we observe that , by definition , the immediate predecessor
