A solution would be to combine the two different  approaches presented above: we index both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts; during query processing, the  information is retrieved from the word index for IV terms and from the phonetic index for OOV terms.
It has been experimentally observed that over 10% of user queries can contain OOV terms [16], as queries often  relate to named entities that typically have a poor coverage in the ASR vocabulary.
One of the conclusions of those tracks was that the effectiveness of retrieval mostly depends on the  accuracy of the transcripts.
The retrieval is based
