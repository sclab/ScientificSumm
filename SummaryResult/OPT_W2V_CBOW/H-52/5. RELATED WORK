Consequently, phonetic approaches should be used only for OOV search; for  searching queries containing also IV terms, this technique affects the performance of the retrieval in comparison to the word based approach.
[17] propose a model for spoken document retrieval using WCNs in order to improve the recall and the MAP of the search.
An alternative approach consists of using word lattices in order to improve the effectiveness of SDR.
An important issue to be considered when looking at the state-of-the-art in retrieval of spoken data, is the lack of a common test set and appropriate query terms.
They propose
