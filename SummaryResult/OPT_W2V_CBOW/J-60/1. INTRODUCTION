1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.
The SPE-implementability concept seems natural for the following reasons: the designed mechanisms usually have non-artificial constructs and a small strategy space.
We demonstrate this concept through some motivating examples that (i) seem natural in distributed settings and (ii) cannot be implemented in dominant  strategies even if there is an authorized center with a direct  connection to every agent or even if players have single-parameter domains.
In particular , the subfield of Mechanism Design deals with
