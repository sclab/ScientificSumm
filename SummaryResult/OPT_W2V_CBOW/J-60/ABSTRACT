Even if the information is recorded with some probability, this enables us to implement a wider range of social goals,  using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
As it turns out, many natural social goals cannot be implemented using the  dominant strategy concept [35, 32, 22, 20].
The main positive results are the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms and computationally efficient mechanisms for severely restricted players (single-parameter domains).
We thus suggest a notion of partially informed environments.
This suggests that the standard requirements must be relaxed in order to construct general-purpose mechanisms.
As a case study ,
