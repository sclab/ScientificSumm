However, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs.
The challenge is to find more realistic scenarios in which the partial informational  assumption is applicable.
In this paper we have seen a new partial informational assumption, and we have demonstrated its suitability to networks in which computational agents can easily collect and distribute information.
As a result, the probability that the environment is informed decreases, and  selfish agents would not cooperate.
