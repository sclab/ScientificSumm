To estimate ¯wm, we only need to calculate the  numerical solutions for dimensions that are related to user m. To estimate σ2 k and µk, we only sum over users that are related to the kth feature.
However, the  numerical solutions are very unreliable for ¯wm,k and σm,k when the kth dimension is not related to the mth user.
However, we are estimating the posterior distribution of the variables at the E step.
Thus we get the following new EM-like algorithm : Modified E step : For each user m , estimate the user model distribution P (
