Assume that each user model wm is an independent draw from a population distribution P(w|Φ), which is governed by some unknown hyperparameter Φ.
Let the prior distribution of user model w be a Gaussian distribution with parameter Φ = (µ, Σ), which is the commonly used prior for linear models.
µ = (µ1, µ2, ..., µK ) is a K dimensional vector that represents the mean of the Gaussian distribution, and Σ is the covariance matrix of the Gaussian.
j = 1 , 2 , ... , Jm : The index for a set of data for user m. Jm is the
