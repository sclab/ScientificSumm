Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that the proposed new  algorithm works better than the standard EM algorithm on the Netflix and MovieLens data sets.
This is not  surprising since the number of related feature-users pairs is much smaller than the number of unrelated feature-user pairs on these two data sets, and thus the proposed new algorithm is expected to work better.
Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Figure 4 show that on all data sets , the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach has a statistical significant improvement over the regularized linear regression model , which is equivalent to the
