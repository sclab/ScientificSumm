The proposed technique can also be adapted to improve the learning in such a  scenario.
Although we are focusing on the Bayesian  hierarchical linear models for recommendation and filtering, the new idea of using analytical solution instead of numerical solution for unrelated user-feature pairs at the M step could be adapted to many other problems. 
The research is important because scalability is a major concern for researchers when using the Bayesian hierarchical linear modeling approach to build a practical large scale system, even though the literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of the models in many applications.
It is worth mentioning
