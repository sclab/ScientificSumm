LCE is novel in that it performs single or multi-term expansion within a framework that allows the modeling of term dependencies and the use of arbitrary  features, whereas previous work has been based on the bag of words assumption and term occurrence features.
The technique was shown to be a natural extension of the Markov random field model for information retrieval and a generalization of  relevance models.
This reconfirms previous observations that modeling  dependencies via the use of proximity features within the MRF has more of an impact on larger, noisier collections than smaller, well-behaved ones.
Finally , we reiterated
