From observations and subject comments we perceived that when using ERF systems subjects generally forgot to provide the feedback but also employed different criteria during the ERF process (i.e., they were assessing relevance rather than expressing an interest).
The results also show the effects of task complexity on the IRF process and how rapidly subjects reach their most interactive point.
Also , in the design of search systems it implies that since different types of RF may be appropriate for different task complexities then a system that could automatically detect complexity could use both ERF and IRF simultaneously to benefit
