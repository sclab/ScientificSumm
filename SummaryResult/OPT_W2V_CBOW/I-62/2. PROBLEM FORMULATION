The approach here is to sum the difference between the real value of a state to the maximal Q-value of this state if resource res cannot be used for all states in a trajectory given by the  policy of task ta.
The  actions a ∈ A(s) applicable in a state are the  combination of all resource assignments that may be executed, according to the state s. In particular, a is simply an allocation of resources to the current tasks, and ata is the resource allocation to task ta.
For our problem , a reward of 1 × wta
