On the other hand, when the available resource are shared, no Q-decomposition is possible and we proposed tight bounds for heuristic search.
The experiments have shown that Q-decomposition seems a very efficient approach when a group of agents have to allocate resources which are only available to themselves, but the actions made by an agent may influence the reward obtained by at least another agent.
In particular, both these approaches proposed an efficient state trajectory updates, when given upper and lower bounds.
Our tight bounds would enable , for both frtdp and brtdp , to reduce the number of backup
