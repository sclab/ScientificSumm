To compute the lower bound of revenue-bound, all available resources have to be separated in many types or parts to be allocated.
Q-decomposition permits to diminish the planning time significantly in our problem settings, and seems a very efficient approach when a group of agents have to allocate resources which are only available to themselves, but the  actions made by an agent may influence the reward obtained by at least another agent.
For the local constraints, at most 1 resource of each type can be  allocated to execute tasks in a specific state.
