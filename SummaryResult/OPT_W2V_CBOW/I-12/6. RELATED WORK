Similarly, clustering algorithms  designed for the task of class identification in spatial databases (e.g., relying on a density-based notion [4]) are not useful for our case, because our data has no spatial attributes.
Selective-sharing relies on the ability to find similarity between specific parts of the probability distribution function associated with a characteristic of different users.
The most relevant method for our purposes is the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy index that is used in probability theory and  information theory [12].
However , the method will perform poorly in scenarios in which the functions alternate between different levels while keeping the general
