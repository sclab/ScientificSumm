The distribution functions used in the experiments (i.e., the  distribution functions assigned to each user in the simulated  environment) are multi-rectangular shaped.
The user associated with the above distribution function spends most of her time in  reporting (notice that this is the largest rectangle in terms of area), an activity associated with a relatively high cost of interruption.
At each step of a simulation , each of the CAs samples its owner ( i.e. , all CAs in the system collect data at a similar rate ) and then estimates the parameter ( either the expected cost when using the
