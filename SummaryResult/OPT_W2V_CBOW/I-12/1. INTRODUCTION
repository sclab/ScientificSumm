In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual  parameters they need for their decision-making.
However, the mechanisms themselves are general and can be applied not only to other fast-paced domains, but also in other multi-agent settings in which agents are collecting data that  overlaps to some extent, at approximately similar rates, and in which the environment imposes the no-structure, limited- and early-use constraints defined above (e.g., exploration of remote planets).
