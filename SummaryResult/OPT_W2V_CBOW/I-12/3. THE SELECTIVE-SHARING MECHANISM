The number of additional  observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the  similarity between its owner and other owners.
Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values, especially in the initial stages of learning, can make a significant difference in performance, especially because the agent is severely limited in the number of times it can interact with its owner in  fastpaced domains.
The most straightforward method for the CA to
