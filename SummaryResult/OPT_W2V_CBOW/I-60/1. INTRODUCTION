We recognize two typical behaviors that the self-interested agents could embark upon, in the context of vehicular  networks.
In this paper, we investigate the attraction of being a  selfish agent in vehicular networks.
We note that the introduction of self-interested agents to the network, would most probably motivate other agents to try and detect these agents in order to minimize their effect.
To demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents, we have used a simulation environment, which  models the transportation network in a central part of a large real city.
This is achieved by reporting heavy traffic values for the
