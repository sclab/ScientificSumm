The main contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we  formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they  encounter in parallel (the S-DM model).
of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).
In all these applications , any two
