Notice that if all agents are using the same sample size, N, then the value xN resulting from solving Equation 10 by substituting k = N and xk = xN is a stable reservation value (i.e., none of the agents can benefit from changing just the value of xN ).
This guarantees that once the  concave expression A(N) âˆ’ c(N) shifts from a positive value to a negative one (with the increase in N), it cannot become positive again.
When c ( N ) is linear ( or convex ) , then : ( a ) When all other agents
