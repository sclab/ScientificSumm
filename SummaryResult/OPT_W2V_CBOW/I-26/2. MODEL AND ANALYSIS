An immediate derivative from the above lemma is that no  tiebreaking procedures are required and an agent in a waiting state is always waiting for a reply from the single agent that is associated with the highest utility among the agents in the set A∗ (i.e., no other agent in the set A∗ is associated with an equal utility).
We denote by RN (x) the probability that the maximum utility that agent Ai can be  guaranteed when interacting with N agents (i.e., the highest utility to which a commit message will be received) is at most x.
