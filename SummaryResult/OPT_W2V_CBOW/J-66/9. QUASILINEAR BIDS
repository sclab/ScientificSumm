But now notice that this expression is maximized as a function of πci by the decomposed  solution for this charity (the terms without πci in them do not matter, and of course in the decomposed solution we always set πbi j = ui j(πci )).
Given a DONATION-CLEARING instance with payment maximization as the objective where all bids are quasilinear and concave, consider the following  algorithm.
The resulting solution is certainly valid : first of all , at least as much money is collected as is given away , because bj πbj − ci πci = bj ci πbi j −
