Also, it is not immediately clear how to make a donation conditional on other  donations to multiple charities, when the donator has different levels of appreciation for the different charities.
Subsequently, we show that the clearing problem is much easier when bids are quasilinear-for surplus, the problem decomposes across charities, and for payment maximization, a greedy approach is optimal if the bids are concave (although this latter  problem is weakly NP-complete when the bids are not concave).
We also show that there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.
We formulate the corresponding clearing problem
