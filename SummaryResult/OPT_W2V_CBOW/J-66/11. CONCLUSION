We also showed that even though the clearing problem  decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.
We  formulated the corresponding clearing problem (deciding how much each bidder pays, and how much each charity receives), and showed that it is NP-complete to approximate to any  ratio even in very restricted settings.
Subsequently , we showed that the clearing problem is much easier when bids are quasilinear ( where payment willingness functions are linear ) -for surplus , the problem decomposes across charities , and for payment maximization ,
