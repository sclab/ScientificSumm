(The solution is nonzero by assumption; if only some bk are accepted, the total payment from these bids is at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| < 1, which is not enough for any bid to be accepted; and if one of the bl is accepted, then the threshold for the corresponding bv is also reached.)
Because is not possible (for any v ∈ V ) that both b+v and b−v are accepted, it follows that the total payment by the bv and the bl can be at most 2|V | − 1 4 .
All that remains to show is that at least T
