Because we only use binary variables when either a  utility function ui j or a payment willingness function wj is not concave, it follows that if all of these are concave, our MIP formulation is simply a linear program-which can be solved in polynomial time.
In the case where the ui j are concave, this is easy: if (sl, tl) and (sl+1, tl+1) are endpoints of a finite linear segment in the function, we add the constraint that ui j ≤ tl + πci −sl sl+1−sl (tl+1 − tl).
Each ui j is given as a function of πci by the
