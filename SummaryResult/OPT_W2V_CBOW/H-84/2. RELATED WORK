Also their algorithms are tuned to work on specific genres of topics such as earthquakes, accidents, etc., while we expect our algorithms to generalize over any topic.
The hierarchy within a topic does impose a structure on the topic, but we do not know of an effort to explore the extent to which that structure  reflects the underlying event relationships.
In a work closest to ours, Makkonen [8] suggested modeling news topics in terms of its evolving events.
However , in TDT-2003 , a hierarchical structure of topic detection has been proposed and [ 2 ] made useful attempts to
