The direction of dependency is determined by the time-ordering of the first stories in the respective events.
In many text clustering systems, the similarity between two  stories is the inner product of their tf-idf vectors, hence we use it as one of our features.
6.2.2 Simple Thresholding This model is an extension of the complete link model with an additional constraint that there is a dependency between any two events Ù and Ú only if the average cosine similarity between event Ù and event Ú is greater than a threshold Ì.
We have three different ways to compute the similarity
