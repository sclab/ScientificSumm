Our experiments also show that we can do fairly well on dependencies using only surface-features such as  cosinesimilarity and time-stamps of news stories as long as true events are provided to the system.
We also hope to devise an iterative algorithm which can improve clustering and dependency performance alternately as suggested by one of the reviewers.
We developed a  timedecay based clustering approach that takes advantage of  temporallocalization of news stories on the same event and showed that it performs significantly better than the baseline approach based on cosine similarity.
Hence , we should focus not only on improving dependencies
