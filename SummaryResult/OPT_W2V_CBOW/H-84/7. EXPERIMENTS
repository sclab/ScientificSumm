On the whole, we notice that while the clustering performance is comparable to the experiments in section 7.1, the overall performance is undermined by the low dependency performance.
On the whole, we observe that the surface-level features we used capture the dependencies to a  reasonable level achieving a best value of 0.72 DF on the test set.
Then we modeled only the dependencies by providing to the system the true clusters and running only the dependency algorithms of section 6.2.
The results on the training set , also presented in table 6 , indicate that cos+TD+Simple-Thresholding is significantly better than
