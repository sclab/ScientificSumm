In other words, an argument is undercut if and only if there is another argument which has as its conclusion the negation of an element of the support for the first argument.
The set of acceptable arguments for an argumentation system A(Δ), Undercut, Pref is recursively defined as: A(Δ) = [ Fi≥0(∅) = AUndercut,Pref ∪ h[ Fi≥1(AUndercut,Pref ) i An argument is acceptable if it is a member of the acceptable set, and a proposition is acceptable if it is the conclusion of an acceptable argument.
We write AUndercut , Pref to denote the set of all non-undercut
