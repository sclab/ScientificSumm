For the scheduling problem where the agents are able to dynamically reallocate resources, each agent must specify a value for every combination of bundles and time steps within its time horizon.
Let bÏ„ be the global time horizon for the problem, before which all of the agents" MDPs must finish.
2.2 Combinatorial Resource Scheduling A straightforward approach to resource scheduling for a set of agents M , whose values for the resources are induced by stochastic planning problems ( in our case , finite-horizon MDPs ) would be to have each agent enumerate all possible resource assignments over time
