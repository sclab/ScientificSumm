Relaxing the assumption about deterministic arrival and departure times of the agents is a focus of our future work.
While there are many domains where this  assumption is valid, in many cases agents arrive and  depart dynamically and their arrival and departure times can only be predicted probabilistically, leading to online resource-allocation problems.
We used a reward model where agents" rewards depend only on the time horizon of their MDPs and not the global start time.
Finally, we have assumed that agents" arrival and  departure times (τa m and τd m) are deterministic and known a priori.
This
