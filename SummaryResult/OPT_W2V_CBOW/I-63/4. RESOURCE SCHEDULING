Finally, for the problem formulation where resource  assignments are static during a lifetime of an agent, we add a constraint that ensures that the resource-usage variables Δ do not change their value while the agent is active (θ = 1).
Note that if we wanted to model a problem where agents could pause their MDPs at arbitrary time steps (which might be useful for domains where dynamic reallocation is  possible), we could easily accomplish this by including an extra action that transitions from each state to itself with zero reward.
The meaning of the activity indicators θ is illustrated in Figure
