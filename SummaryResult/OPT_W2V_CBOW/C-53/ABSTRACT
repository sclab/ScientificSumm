Since DR can filter most unnecessary state updates and improve the scalability of a system, it is widely used in commercial CDMG.
Dead-Reckoning (DR) is an effective method to maintain consistency for Continuous Distributed Multiplayer Games (CDMG).
However, DR cannot maintain high consistency, and this constrains its application in highly interactive games.
With the help of global synchronization, DR can achieve higher consistency, but it still cannot eliminate before inconsistency.
Performance evaluation shows that GS-DR-LL can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.
In this paper , a method named Globally Synchronized DR with
