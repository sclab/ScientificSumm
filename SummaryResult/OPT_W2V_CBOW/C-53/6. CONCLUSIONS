Compared with traditional DR, GS-DR can eliminate after inconsistency through the synchronization of physical clocks, but it cannot tackle before inconsistency, which would significantly influence the usability and fairness of a game.
GS-DR-LL has significant implications to consistency maintenance approaches.
As a result, the application of local lag can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems which have large typical network transmission delay (e.g.
In this paper , we proposed a method named GS-DR-LL , which combines local lag and GS-DR , to decrease before inconsistency through delaying updating the execution results of local operations
