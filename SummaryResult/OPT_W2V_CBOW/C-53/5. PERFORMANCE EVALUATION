Compared with GS-DR, GS-DR-LL can decrease more inconsistency, and it eliminates most inconsistency when the network transmission delay is 100 ms and the threshold is 4 pixels or 5 degrees.
The 5th Workshop on Network & System Support for Games 2006 - NETGAMES 2006 5 From all above results, it can be indicated that GS-DR and  GSDR-LL both can eliminate after inconsistency, and GS-DR-LL can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.
The main purpose of performance evaluation is to study the effects of GS-DR-LL on decreasing before inconsistency in a particular game system under different thresholds ,
