In this paper, we considered an online scheduling domain for which algorithms with the best possible competitive  ratio had been found, but for which new solutions were  required when the setting is extended to include self-interested agents.
We presented a mechanism that is incentive  compatible with respect to release time, deadline, length and value, and that only increases the competitive ratio by one.
We also showed how this mechanism could be simplified when k = 1 and each agent cannot lie about the length of its job.
We then showed a matching lower bound on the competitive ratio that can
