The setting addressed by these papers is completely  nonstrategic, and the algorithm is assumed to always know the true characteristics of each job upon its release.
Then, the adversary observes the algorithm and selects the sequence of jobs that maximizes the competitive ratio: the ratio of the value of the jobs completed by an optimal oï¬„ine algorithm to the value of those completed by the online algorithm.
A basic solution concept of mechanism design is incentive compatibility , which , in our setting , requires that it is always in each agent '' s best interests to immediately submit its
