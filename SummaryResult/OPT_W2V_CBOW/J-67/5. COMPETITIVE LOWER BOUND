Then, in order to achieve the desired competitive ratio, it must execute job x continuously until its deadline, which is by construction at least as late as the new deadline df of job f. Thus, job f will not be completed, and, by IR and NNP, it must be the case that pf (θf , θ−f , θx) = 0 and uf (g(θf , θ−f , θx), θf ) = 0.
Since we will later need this inequality to be strict , if vf = pf ( θ ) , then change θf to θf , where rf = rf , but vf , lf ,
