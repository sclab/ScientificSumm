Assume by contradiction that this condition does not hold- that is, job i is not completed when ri is truthfully declared, but is completed for some false declaration ˆri ≥ ri.
Since the sets {i}, X, Y, Z partition the set of jobs released before ta , we have shown that no job could execute instead of job yc , contradicting the existence of tc , and completing the proof.
First note that job i can not have a higher priority , since there would have to exist a t ∈ ( tp , tc ) such that ∃y ∈ 6 For simplicity
