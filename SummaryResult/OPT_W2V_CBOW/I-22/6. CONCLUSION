It allows group members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental models; (3) Experiments were conducted to evaluate the HMM-based cognitive/processing load models and the impacts of multi-party communication on the  evolving of team SMMs.
The major contribution of this research includes (1) HMM-based load models were proposed for an agent to estimate its human partner"s cognitive load and other HAP teammates" processing loads; (2) The shared  belief map concept was introduced and implemented.
In this paper, we  investigated several factors surrounding the challenging  problem of evolving shared mental models of teams composed of human-agent-pairs.
