Finally,  increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any  advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain.
However , in all cases the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform the simple bidding agent ( p < 0.0005 in Student '' s t-test ) , and its performance is within 7.5 % of that of the optimal allocation that has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and
