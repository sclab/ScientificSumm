The sensor updates are used to construct a sparse interval skip graph that is distributed across proxies, via network messages between proxies over the 802.11b wireless network.
In addition, to reduce the power consumption of the radio while still making the sensor node available for queries, low power listening is enabled, in which the radio receiver is  periodically powered up for a short interval to sense the channel for transmissions, and the packet preamble is extended to account for the latency until the next interval when the receiving radio wakes up.
Given a list of matching intervals from the skip
