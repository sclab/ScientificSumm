Archival storage of past sensor data requires a storage system, the key  attributes of which are: where the data is stored, whether it is indexed, and how the application can access this data in an energy-efficient manner with low latency.
Storage at the remote sensor is in effect treated as appendage of the proxy, resulting in low  implementation complexity, which makes it ideal for small,  resourceconstrained sensor platforms.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sensor storage system that is explicitly tailored for emerging  multitier sensor networks.
Further , the local store is optimized for time-series access
