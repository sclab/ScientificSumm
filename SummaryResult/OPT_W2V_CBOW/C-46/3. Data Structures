For a simple  interval skip graph, however, this maximum value for an entry must be computed over all entries preceding it in the index, as searches may begin anywhere in the data structure, rather than at a distinguished root element.
The main reason for the difference is that skip graphs have a full search structure rooted at each  element, in order to distribute load and provide resilience to system failures in a distributed setting.
It may be easily seen that in the worse case the insertion of a single interval ( one that covers all existing intervals in the index
