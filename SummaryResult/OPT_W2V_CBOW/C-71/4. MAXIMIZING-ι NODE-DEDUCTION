When a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage quality if its sensing area, except what overlaps the network margin, cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are grouped into the same group as itself, the algorithm stops.
â€¢ The deletion of the node will not result in uncovered-points inside the sensing area of i.
A node i  greedily selects an ungrouped sensing neighbor in the same group as  itself one by one, and informs the neighbor it is selected in the group.
Under the constraint that the coverage quality of its
