We assume that a sensor node can only be responsible to monitor a circular area centered at the node with a radius equal to R. This is a usual assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.
The solution of sensor-grouping problem should only base on  locally obtainable information of a sensor node.
Based on this notion , to be more reasonable , researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements : Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes : For a point with physical location L , the point is considered covered by
