It is exciting to see that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi diagram [2] formed by these nodes (A Vonoroi diagram formed by a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node) is a honeycomb-like structure1 .
Î¹ is a very interesting value of a set of points.
In resource-sharing evaluation , the Global Fairness Index ( GFI ) is often employed to measure how even the resource distributes among these points [ 8 ] , when xi represents the amount
