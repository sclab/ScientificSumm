This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to  select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the  surveillance work of the network area.
An algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which  redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.
We also introduce another greedy solution called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) for this problem, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate MIND.
Section 4 investigates the application of ι in this grouping
