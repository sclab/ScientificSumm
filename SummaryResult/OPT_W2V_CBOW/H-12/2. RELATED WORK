Most of the experimental work using query-biased  summarization has focused on comparing their value to searchers relative to other types of summary [20, 21], rather than  efficient generation of summaries.
White et al [21] report some experimental timings of their WebDocSum system, but the snippet  generation algorithms themselves are not isolated, so it is difficult to infer snippet generation time comparable to the times we report in this paper. 
Despite the importance of efficient summary generation in Web search, few algorithms appear in the literature.
Snippet generation is a special type of extractive document summarization , in which sentences ,
