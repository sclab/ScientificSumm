In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the  expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.
This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value ( note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G > > ri ) : δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items , weighted by their frequency of access : δagg ( no − zeb ) = T i=1
