The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.
This captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.
Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected.
