This strategy aims to adjust the bids so that the marginal values at each  machine being bid on are the same.
Thus, we obtain the  following algorithm to compute the best response of a user: 1.
For a subset of machines A, denote by x(A) the best  response on A without parallelism bound and by U(A) the utility obtained by the best response algorithm.
In particular, we would like to know if the intuitive strategy of each player constantly re-adjusting his bids  according to the best response algorithm leads to the  equilibrium.
We suspect that the local maxima
