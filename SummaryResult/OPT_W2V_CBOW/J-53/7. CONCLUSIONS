Another assumption is that users have infinite work, so the more resources they can  acquire, the better.
In addition, with a few exceptions under the finite parallelism model, the system reaches equilibrium quickly by using the best response algorithm and, when the number of users is not too small, by the greedy local  adjustment method.
When the job size is large enough and the degree of multiplexing is sufficiently low, we can probably ignore those effects, but those costs should be taken into account for a more realistic modeling.
One direction is to consider more realistic utility functions.
Another direction
