When δ = 1, we have that x = α, y = 1 − α, which is the symmetric equilibrium that is consistent with our intuition - each user puts a bid proportional to his preference of the machine.
We next show that the utility uniformity of the m-player allocation game cannot exceed m. Let (S1, .
For a meaningful discussion of efficiency and fairness , we assume that the users are symmetric by requiring that Xi = 1 andPn j=1 wij = 1 for all the 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Or informally , we require all the users have the same budget
