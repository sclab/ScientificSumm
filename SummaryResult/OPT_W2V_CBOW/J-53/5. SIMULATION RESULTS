we consider that the system has converged if the utility gap of each user is smaller than (0.001 in our experiments).
For both user preference models, the efficiency at the  equilibrium is approximately 0.9, independent of the number of users, which is only slightly worse than the social optimum.
Although utility uniformity decreases in the number of users, it remains reasonable even for a large number of users, and flattens out at some point.
For a larger number of users , the system converges and achieves a lower level of utility uniformity , but a high degree of efficiency and
