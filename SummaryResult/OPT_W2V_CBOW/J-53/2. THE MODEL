We consider the price anticipating mechanism in which each user places a bid to each machine, and the price of the machine is determined by the total bids placed.
By the assumption that the user is selfish, each user"s bidding vector is the best response to the system.
Now, player 2 has to put a positive bid on machine 2 to claim the machine, but there is no lower limit, resulting in the non-existence of the Nash equilibrium.
To model this , we also consider the more realistic finite parallelism model , where the user '' s parallelism
