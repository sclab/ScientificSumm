The posterior Pt+1 ( φ |φ ) is obtained with Equation 3 with r ( μ ) defined to be the normalisation of t. The valuation method : For a given φk , wexp ( φk ) =Pm j=1 Pt ( φj|φk ) · w ( φj ) is α '' s expectation of the value of what will be observed given that β has stated that φk will be observed , for some measure w. Now suppose that , as before , α observes ϕk after agent β has stated ϕ. α revises the prior estimate of the expected
