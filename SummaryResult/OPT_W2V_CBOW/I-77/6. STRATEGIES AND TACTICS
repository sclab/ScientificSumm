It is reasonable to  expect β to progress towards her target at the same rate and Nα(Ψt ) is calculated by replacing β by α in Equation 6.
If a balance bound requires negative information revelation in one LOGIC category then α will contribute nothing to it, and will leave this to the natural decay to the reputation D as described above. 
Following from Equation 5 , α will want to achieve a negotiation target , Nβ ( Ψt ) such that : ν · Nβ ( Ψt ) + ( 1 − ν ) · V ∗t β is
