8.2 Experimental setup Given that the self-assessments are also sparse in our collection, in order to be able to measure differences between the various  models, we selected a subset of topics, and evaluated (some of the) runs only on this subset.
First, we evaluated the models of the organizational units, using all topics (ALL) and only the main topics (MAIN).
We find a positive impact of the context models only for expert finding.
And finally, is our simple way of combining the monolingual scores sufficient for obtaining significant improvements?
8.5 Multilingual models In this subsection we evaluate the method for
