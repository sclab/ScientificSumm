In particular, we can show the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium for  nondecreasing CGLFs also in the modified model.
In this paper, we introduce and investigate congestion  settings with unreliable resources, in which the probability of a resource"s failure depends on the congestion experienced by this resource.
In addition, it is of  interest to develop an efficient algorithm for the computation of pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as well as discuss the social (in)efficiency of the equilibria. 
In particular , we plan to consider CGLFs where the resources may have different costs and failure probabilities , as
