Let z ∈ Σ0 be a nearly-even (not necessarily even) DS-stable profile such that mine∈M hz e = 0, and note that the profile x satisfies the above conditions.
(1) Let x be a strategy profile which is obtained from x by a (one-step) addition of some resource a ∈ M by some agent i ∈ N(x) (note that x is nearly-even).
We show below that by performing a finite series of ( onestep ) addition operations on x , we obtain an even , DSstable strategy profile y with higher congestion , that is with hy > hx =
