Our work provides the first model of congestion settings with resource failures, which considers the sum of  congestiondependent costs over utilized resources, and therefore, does not extend the CGF-model, but rather generalizes the classic model of congestion games.
In particular, if in our model the resource failure probabilities were constant and known in  advance, then a potential function would exist.
Monderer [8] dealt with another type of generalization of congestion games, in which the resource cost functions are player-specific (PS-congestion games).
Our results We show that CGLFs and , in particular , CGLFs with nondecreasing cost functions , do not
