6.1 Performance/Space-Optimal Approaches One strategy to eliminate the problem of skipped  postings is to eagerly materialize sublists for all elementary time intervals, i.e., to choose M = E. In doing so, for every query q t only postings valid at time t are read and thus the best possible performance is achieved.
The time complexity of the algorithm is in O(n2 ) - for each prefix subproblem the above recurrence must be evaluated, which is possible in linear time if list sizes |L : [ti, tj)| are precomputed.
The initial approach described above that keeps only the full list Lv and thus picks
