Note that EPC values are smaller on WIKI than on  UKGOV, since terms in the query workload employed for WIKI are relatively rarer in the corpus.
Index size continues to reduce on both datasets, as we increase the value of .
For both datasets, we started with the coalesced index produced by a moderate threshold setting of = 0.10.
For both the WIKI and UKGOV datasets, we compare temporally coalesced indexes for different values of the error threshold computed using Algorithm 1 with the non-coalesced index as a baseline.
iii ) The SB approach achieves close-to-optimal performance on both datasets , if
