Second, when coalescing a subsequence of postings of the  input into a single posting of the output, we want the  approximation error to be below a threshold .
If this test fails, a coalesced posting bearing the old representative is added to the output sequence O and, following that, the bookkeeping is reinitialized.
Note that, since we make no assumptions about the sort order of index lists, temporal-coalescing algorithms have an additional preprocessing cost in O(|Lv| log |Lv|) for sorting the index list and chopping it up into subsequences for each document.
