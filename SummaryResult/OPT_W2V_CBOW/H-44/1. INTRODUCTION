Time-travel text search, as we develop it in this paper, is a crucial tool to explore these collections and to unfold their full potential as the following example demonstrates.
Text search on these collections,  however, is mostly time-ignorant: while the searched collection changes over time, often only the most recent version of a documents is indexed, or, versions are indexed  independently and treated as separate documents.
As a consequence, na¨ıve approaches to time-travel text search fail, and viable approaches must scale-up well to such large data volumes.
In this work we address time-travel text search over temporally versioned document collections
