Eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the  utility (wtp) of one full outcome (the reference outcome θ0 ), and then obtaining the function over each maximal clique using monetary differences between its possible assignments (technique known as pricing out [17]), keeping the variables in the conditional set fixed.
These ceteris paribus elicitation queries are local in the sense that the agent does not need to consider the values of the rest of the  attributes.
An outcome in this space is represented for example by ( θ , p ) , where θ is an instantiation of A and p
