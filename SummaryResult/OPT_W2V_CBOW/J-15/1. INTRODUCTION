To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.
We first lay out a representation framework for preferences that captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute  configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each.
Constructing and  communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical  multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some  simplified form.
To apply it for modeling values for
