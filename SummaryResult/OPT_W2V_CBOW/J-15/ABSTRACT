Real preferences often exhibit  dependencies among attributes, yet may possess some structure that can be usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify  operation of a multiattribute auction.
We develop such a structure using the theory of measurable value functions, a cardinal utility representation based on an underlying order over preference  differences.
We introduce an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full space of joint configurations.
A set of local conditional independence relations over such differences supports a generalized additive preference  representation, which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of related attributes.
