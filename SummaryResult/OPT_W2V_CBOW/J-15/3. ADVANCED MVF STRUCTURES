229 The next theorem establishes that the functional constituents of MVF are the same as those for GAI decompositions as defined by Fishburn [13] for EU.
, g (4) fr = u([Ir]) + r−1X k=1 (−1)k X 1≤i1<···<ik<r u([ k\ s=1 Iis ∩ Ir]) The proof directly shows that if graph G = (A, E) is a perfect map of CDI, u(A) decomposes to a sum over the functions defined in (4).1 Thus this proof does not rely on the decomposition result of Theorem 5, only on the existence of the perfect map.
For this purpose we
