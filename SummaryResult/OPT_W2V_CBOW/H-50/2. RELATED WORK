As pointed out by Riker [25], we can distinguish two  families of rank aggregation methods: positional methods which assign scores to items to be ranked according to the ranks they receive and majoritarian methods which are based on pairwise comparisons of items to be ranked.
For instance, in [20], each input ranking j is divided into a number of segments, and the conditional probability of  relevance (R) of each document di depending on the segment k it occurs in, is computed, i.e.
The consensus ranking corresponds to the stationary  distribution of MC4.
