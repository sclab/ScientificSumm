We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning  mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience.
This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation  solution.
To further verify this distributed approach, we would like to develop a centralized approach, so we can evaluate how good the solution from this  distributed approach is compared to the optimal solution found by the centralized approach. 
Using this information , the agent can
