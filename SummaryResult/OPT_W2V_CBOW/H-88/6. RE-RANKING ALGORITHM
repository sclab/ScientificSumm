The algorithm takes as input the priority queue S containing the initial ranking, and produces the top-m  reranked nodes in the priority queue F. After initializing F to be empty on line 1, the algorithm loops m times over lines  215, transferring at least one node from S to F during each iteration.
The vector x.g is initially zero and is updated by the algorithm as elements are reported.
At the start of each iteration , the unreported node at the front of S has the greatest adjusted score , and it is removed and added to F. The algorithm
