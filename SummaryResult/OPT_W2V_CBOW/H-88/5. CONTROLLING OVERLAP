One approach to adjusting the scores of unreported elements in step 2 might be based on the Okapi BM25 scores of the involved elements.
Starting with an element ranking generated by the  baseline method described in the previous section, elements are re-ranked to control overlap by iteratively adjusting the scores of those elements containing or contained in higher ranking elements.
[20] argue strongly against the linear combination of Okapi scores in this  fashion.
In equation 1 , xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt , where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and
