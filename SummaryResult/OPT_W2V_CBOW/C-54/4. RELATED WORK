In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.
For our peer-to-peer transfer approach (APPOINT),  Napster is the forefather where a directory service is centralized on a server and users exchange music files that they have stored on their local disks.
From our perspective, although APPOINT employs some of the techniques used in peer-to-peer systems, it is also closely related to current Web caching architectures.
Although the advantage of this solution is
