Since the locally run database is only updated when  additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.
In  particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.
Notice , that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel , then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order
