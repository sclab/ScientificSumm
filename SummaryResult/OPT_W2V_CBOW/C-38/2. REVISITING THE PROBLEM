Using available bandwidth as criteria for parent selection does not scale for two reasons: First, to cope with dynamics of bandwidth variations, each peer requires to periodically  estimate the available bandwidth from all other peers through measurement (e.g., [6]).
Each peer selects a new parent in a demand-driven fashion in order to minimize the number of end-to-end bandwidth measurements, and thus improve scalability.
Information about other peers are used by the PS mechanism at each peer to determine proper parent peers through which it should connect to the overlay.
We conclude that a practical solution for peer-topeer streaming applications should
