Limited deployment of IP multicast has motivated a new distribution paradigm over the Internet based on overlay networks where a group of participating end-systems (or peers) form an overlay structure and actively participate in distribution of content without any special support from the network (e.g., [7]).
Since overlay structures are layered over the best-effort Internet , any approach for constructing overlay should address the following fundamental challenges : ( i ) Scalability with the number of participating peers , ( ii ) Robustness to dynamics of peer participation , ( iii ) Adaptation to variations of network bandwidth , and
