• We moved this personalized search framework further and proposed to make the expansion process adaptive to features of each query, a strong focus being put on its clarity level.
• Within a separate set of experiments, we showed our adaptive algorithms to provide an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best approach.
Finally, we are designing a set of more complex combinations of these metrics in order to provide enhanced adaptivity to our algorithms. 
In this paper we proposed to expand Web search queries by exploiting the user '' s Personal Information Repository in order to automatically
