Thus, more experiments are needed in order to determine the  optimal number of generated expansion keywords, as a function of the query ambiguity level.
The major reason seems to be the imperfect selection of the number of expansion terms, as a function of query clarity.
Consequently, we employed more additional terms, when the query was more ambiguous in the Web, but also on the Desktop.
Given the algorithms and clarity measures , we implemented the adaptivity procedure by tailoring the amount of expansion terms added to the original query , as a function of its ambiguity in the Web ,
