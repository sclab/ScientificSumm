The deduction  process is particularly complicated in the case of the task information as the monitoring agents do not have access to the private  schedules of the domain agents.
There are two approaches commonly used to achieve robustness in multiagent systems: 1. the Survivalist Approach [12], which involves replicating  domain agents in order to allow the replicas to take over should the original agents fail; and 2. the Citizen Approach [7], which involves the use of special monitoring agents (called Sentinel Agents) in order to detect agent failure and dynamically startup new agents in lieu of the failed ones.
The
