The goal is to make the expected finish time of all servers the same.
When a threshold is reached, the co-allocation server stopped dividing the remainder of the file and assigns that remainder as the final section.
UnassignedFileSize is the portion of file A not yet distributed for downloading; initially, UnassignedFileSize is equal to the total size of file A. is the rate that determines how much of the section remains to be assigned.
By contrast , lower threshold values will induce more frequent dynamic server workload adjustments and , in the case of greater network fluctuations , result in
