In the next experiment, we used the Recursive-Adjustment  CoAllocation strategy with various sets of replica servers and measured overall performances, where overall performance is: Total Performance = File size/Total Completion Time (5) Table 2 lists all experiments we performed and the sets of replica servers used.
These results demonstrate that our approach efficiently reduces the differences in servers finish times.
The experimental results shown in Figure 6 ( b ) indicate that our scheme beginning block reassembly as soon as the first blocks have been completely delivered reduces combination time , thus aiding co-allocation strategies like Conservative Load Balancing and RecursiveAdjustment
