In this paper, we propose a dynamic co-allocation scheme based on co-allocation Grid data transfer architecture called  RecursiveAdjustment Co-Allocation scheme that reduces the idle time spent waiting for the slowest server and improves data transfer performance [24].
Downloading large datasets from several replica locations may result in varied performance rates, because the replica sites may have different architectures, system loadings, and network connectivity.
Recently, large-scale, data-sharing scientific communities such as those described in [1, 5] used this technology to replicate their large datasets over several sites.
Bandwidth quality is the most important factor affecting transfers between clients and servers since
