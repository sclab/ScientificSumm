The loadings on the co-allocated flows are automatically adjusted because the faster servers will deliver more quickly providing larger portions of the file.
And it uses GridFTP [1, 11, 16], a reliable, secure, and efficient data transport protocol to provide efficient management and transfer of terabytes or petabytes of data in a wide-area, distributed-resource environment.
As datasets are replicated within Grid environments for reliability and performance, clients require the abilities to discover existing data replicas, and create and register new replicas.
The Aggressive Load Balancing dynamic co-allocation strategy presented in [ 17 ] adds functions that change block size de-liveries
