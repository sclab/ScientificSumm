In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.
The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows.
We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat
