Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.
In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.
Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating : bi ( θi ) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning
