0.1 0.9 1 0.5 1 v w Figure 3: A trimmed policy for V The point is that the payoff matrix of W can now be chosen to prevent the LKS algorithm from finding a Nash equilibrium.
In the downward pass, the chosen values are w = .1, then, from the trimming, v = 0 and u = 1, which is not a Nash equilibrium since W prefers action 1.
The paper then claims that any vertex V can compute its  breakpoint policy with respect to its parent W given the breakpoint  policies of its children U1, .
This can be achieved if ,
