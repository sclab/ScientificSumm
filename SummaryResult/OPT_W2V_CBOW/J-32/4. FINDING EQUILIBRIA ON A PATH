As v = 0, 1, V is, in fact, indifferent between playing 0 and 1, which is only possible if w = f(vj−1).
Since w = f(u), V is indifferent between  playing 0 and 1; in particular, it can play v. Therefore, if we define vj+1 = w, the vector of strategies (v1, .
Similarly to the previous case , we can show that B ( W , V ) ∩ [ 0 , 1 ] × ( 0 , 1 ) consists of the rectangle { α } × [ 0 , 1 ] and at most 2j + 2 rectangles of
