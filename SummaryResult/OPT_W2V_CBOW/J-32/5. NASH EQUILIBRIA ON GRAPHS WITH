For the second search, note that if Vi plays a mixed strategy, then vi+1 and vi−1 satisfy an equation of the form vi+1 = (A0 + A1vi−1)/(B0 + B1vi−1).
For an odd-length cycle all other vj "s are derivable from those solutions, and if a fully mixed Nash equilibrium exists, all the vj should turn out to be real numbers in the range (0, 1).
Since all vertices in the cycle play mixed strategies, we have vi+3 = (A0 +A1vi+1)/(B0 +B1vi+1).
, Vk ( in cyclic order ) , we make two separate searches for a Nash equilibrium : first we
