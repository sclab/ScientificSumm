We show that this is inevitable by constructing a family of graphical games on bounded-degree trees for which best response policies of some of the vertices have exponential size, and any  twopass algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that is similar in spirit to that of [8]) has to store almost all points of the best response policies.
In Section 3 we describe a simple example for which the algorithm of [9] outputs a vector of strategies that does not constitute a Nash equilibrium of the  underlying game.
( This algorithm is a special case of the generic algorithm of [ 8
