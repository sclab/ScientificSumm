These goals are  specified by the agent programmer and attached to tasks, much like our FAb(P, PF , PA) construct associates failure and abort  methods with a plan P. Note, however, that in contrast to both [6] and our semantics, [21] attach the failure-handling knowledge at the goal, not plan, level.
The FHC approach is defined at the goal level in order to facilitate abstract specification of failure-handling knowledge ; the FHC decides when to address a failure and what to do ( i.e. , what failurehandling goals to invoke ) , separating this knowledge from the how of implementing
