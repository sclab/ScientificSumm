We provide an operational semantics for the execution cycle in the presence of aborts in the abstract agent language CAN, which enables us to specify a BDI-based execution model without limiting our attention to a particular agent system (such as JACK, Jadex, Jason, or SPARK).
We discuss some conditions under which aborting a task or plan is appropriate, and how to determine the consequences of such a decision.
A key technical challenge we address is the presence of parallel execution threads and of sub-tasks , which require the agent to ensure that the abort methods for each plan are carried
