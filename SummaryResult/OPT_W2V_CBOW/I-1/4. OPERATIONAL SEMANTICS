This is followed by the execution of CCR (in the case of an abort), the retraction of a(v ), and failure.
The idea is that, whenever a new pap occurs, the prependID(v, v ) action is used to create a new pap identifier list v from the existing list v. We then add the belief that v is the active context, i.e., +a(v ), and start processing the program within the pap using v instead of v as the context.
We use the Goal construct to allow us to drop the execution of a program within a pap v when
