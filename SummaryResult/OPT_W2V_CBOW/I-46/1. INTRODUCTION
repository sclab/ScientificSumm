However, as we argue in this paper, few existing representation languages are both modular, compact and computationally grounded on the one hand, and allow for representing properties of both knowledge and strategic ability, on the other.
In Section 3, we present an overview of representations that have been used for modeling and model checking systems in which time, action (and possibly knowledge) are important; we mention especially  representations used for theoretical analysis.
Another reason for using a more specialized class of models is that general Kripke structures do not always give enough help in terms of methodology , both at
