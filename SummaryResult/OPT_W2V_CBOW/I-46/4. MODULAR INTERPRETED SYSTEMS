Implicit input function for state q ∈ Sti is given by a sequence ϕ1, η1 , ..., ϕn, ηn , where each ηj ∈ In is an  interaction symbol, and each ϕj is a boolean combination of  propositions ˆηi , with η ∈ In; ˆηi stands for η is the symbol currently generated by agent i.
, ∼k for some arbitrary  accessibility relations ∼i over St. By Proposition 3, there exists a MIS S ˆM with global states Q such that ˆM = cegs(S ˆM , Q) is isomorphic to ˆM.
We denote the unfolding of a MIS S for initial states Q into a
