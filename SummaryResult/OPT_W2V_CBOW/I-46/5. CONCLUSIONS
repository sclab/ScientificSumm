Our representations, called modular interpreted  systems, are: modular, in the sense that components can be changed, replaced, removed or added, with as little changes to the whole  representation as possible; more compact than traditional explicit  representations; and grounded, in the sense that the correspondences between the primitives of the model and the entities being  modeled are more immediate, giving a methodology for designing and implementing systems.
We only suggest that there is a need for compact, modular and reasonably grounded models that are more expressive than  concurrent (epistemic) programs, and still allow for easier theoretical analysis than reactive modules.
