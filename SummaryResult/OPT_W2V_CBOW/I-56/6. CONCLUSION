The idea of DCSP agents using different strategies in the same environment will also be investigated. 
Our work shows that several  wellknown DCSP algorithms, namely ABT, AWC and DBO, can be described as mechanisms sharing the same proposed protocol, and only differ in the strategies employed for the reasoning steps per negotiation round as governed by the protocol.
Applying automated negotiation to DCSP, this paper has  proposed a protocol that prescribes the generic reasoning of a DCSP agent in a BDI architecture.
Future work will attempt to formally establish this property , as well as formalize other existing DSCP algorithms
