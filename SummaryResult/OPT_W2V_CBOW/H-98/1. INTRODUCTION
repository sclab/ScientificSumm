Parametric models generally use assumptions that the data  conform to the model to trade-off flexibility with the ability to estimate the model parameters accurately with little training data.
However, in all of these tasks, the quality of the probability estimates is crucial.
Effective active learning can be key in many information  retrieval tasks where obtaining labeled data can be costly - severely reducing the amount of labeled data needed to reach the same  performance as when new labels are requested randomly [17].
Additionally , these models can be interpreted as assuming the scores produced by the text classifier have three basic
