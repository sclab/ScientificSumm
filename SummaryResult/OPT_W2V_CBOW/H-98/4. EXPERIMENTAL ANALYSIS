The parameters are still fit using maximum likelihood estimation, but a model of noisy class labels is used in addition to allow for the possibility that the class was mislabeled.
In order to generate the scores that each method uses to fit its probability estimates, we use five-fold cross-validation on the  training data.
In addition, we also compare the error of the classifiers at their default thresholds and with the probabilities.
In order to give the reader a better sense of the behavior of these methods , Figures 4-5 show the fits produced by the most competitive of these methods
