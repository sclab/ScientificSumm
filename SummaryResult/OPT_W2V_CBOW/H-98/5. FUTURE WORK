From the empirical evidence presented in [22], the expectation is that such a distribution might allow more emphasis of the probability mass around the modes (as with the exponential) while still providing more accurate estimates toward the tails.
Just as logistic regression allows the log-odds of the posterior distribution to be fit directly with a line, we could directly fit the log-odds of the posterior with a three-piece line (a spline) instead of indirectly doing the same thing by fitting the asymmetric Laplace.
A promising extension to the work presented here is a hybrid distribution of a Gaussian ( on
