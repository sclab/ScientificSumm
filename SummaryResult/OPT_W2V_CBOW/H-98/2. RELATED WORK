In more recent work [27], they investigate using a semi-parametric method that uses a monotonic  piecewiseconstant fit to the data and apply the method to na¨ıve Bayes and a linear SVM.
Lewis & Gale [17] use logistic regression to recalibrate na¨ıve Bayes though the quality of the probability estimates are not directly evaluated; it is simply performed as an intermediate step in active learning.
Our work is similar in flavor to these previous attempts to model search engine scores , but we target text classifier outputs which we have found demonstrate a different type of score distribution behavior because of the
