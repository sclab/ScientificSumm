We have given an efficient way to estimate the parameters of these distributions.
In addition, we have introduced two new families that attempt to capitalize on the asymmetric behavior that tends to arise from learning a discrimination function.
In striking contrast, the asymmetric Laplace distribution appears to be preferable over several large text domains and a variety of  performance measures to the primary competing parametric methods, though comparable performance is sometimes achieved with one of two varieties of logistic regression.
While these distributions attempt to strike a balance between the generalization power of parametric distributions and the flexibility that the
