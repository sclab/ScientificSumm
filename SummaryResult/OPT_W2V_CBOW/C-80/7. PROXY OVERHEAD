The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time.
It is only at higher bandwidths that  latency, measured by the average response time for a client request, and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can be serviced per second, overheads would be visible.
While the  average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to the end-user.
Looking at the Authoring mix of
