To the best of our knowledge, Ganesh is the first system that combines the use of hash-based techniques with caching of database results to improve throughput and response times for applications with dynamic content.
Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching  solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.
The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent storage.
In this section , we first discuss alternative approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses
