In contrast, relational databases have rich internal structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity  detection.
Unlike previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity, Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield superior performance improvement.
This allows hash-based  techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum effectiveness.
Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.
This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source
