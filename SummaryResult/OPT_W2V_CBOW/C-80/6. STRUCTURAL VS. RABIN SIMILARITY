In contrast, Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly increase the size of the chunks.
As Ganesh always performed better than Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in the interests of brevity.
In this case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s.
While one can partially  address these problems by dynamically varying the parameters of the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, this can be computationally  expensive, especially in the presence of changing workloads.
This was confirmed as cache statistics showed that Ganesh
