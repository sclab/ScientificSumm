For all of the experiments, the Ganesh driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000 items1 .
As our focus was on the WAN link between the application server and the database, there were no constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the web server. 
The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is the number of client requests that can be serviced per second.
The benchmark is available in a Enterprise Java Bean ( EJB ) , Java Servlets , and PHP version and has different datasets ; we evaluated Ganesh with
