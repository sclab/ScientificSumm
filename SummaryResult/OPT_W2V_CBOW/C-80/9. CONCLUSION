This paper shows that the impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the database"s strict consistency semantics.
Ganesh is able to use  cryptographic hashes to detect similarity with previous results and send WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content 319 compact recipes of results rather than full results.
The growing use of dynamic web content generated from  relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.
Our results also confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results to detect similarity is crucial
