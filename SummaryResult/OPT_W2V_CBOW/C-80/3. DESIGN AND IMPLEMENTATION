If the entire result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh driver"s cache, the RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.
Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh driver"s cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result fragments.
However, in cases where there is little overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing  result fragments.
This cache is only used as a source of result
