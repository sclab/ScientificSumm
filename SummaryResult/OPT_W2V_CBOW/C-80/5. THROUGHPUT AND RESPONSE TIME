Like the 5 Mb/s case, this response time increases with the addition of extra test clients.
For the Authoring mix, at 800 test clients at 5 Mb/s, Figure 7 (a) shows that Native"s throughput increase by 85% when compared to the original benchmark while Ganesh"s improvement is smaller at 15%.
At 1600 test clients, when  compared to the original benchmark, Native sees a 73% improvement in throughput and a 77% reduction in average response time.
Figure 6 ( a ) also shows that for 400 and 800 test clients Ganesh at 5 Mb/s has the same
