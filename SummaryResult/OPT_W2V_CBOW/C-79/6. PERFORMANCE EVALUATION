In Figure 4, the overhead increases as the speed increase, which is due to the fact that as the speed increase, nodes move out of mesh more frequently, and will send out more search packets.
Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates.
The larger the maximum number of concurrent updates is, the more nodes are picked up to do update.
Then with higher probability, one of these nodes is still in mesh and finishes the update immediately (don"t need to search mesh first), which decreases the delay.
