One approach to designing resource discovery and distribution schemes over MANETs is to construct a peer-to-peer (P2P)  system (or an overlay) which organizes peers of the system into a logical structure, on top of the actual network topology.
However, deploying such P2P systems over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the reactive  routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth utilization in proactive routing schemes.
Query packets are used to  explore a route to other peers holding resources of interest.
Adopting this paradigm , the whole MANET P2P system operates as a collection
