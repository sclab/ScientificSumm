Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a  resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and  invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.
In addition , to accommodate newly participating nodes and mobility of nodes , the focal node periodically floods the validation mesh with a keep-alive packet , so that nodes who can hear this packet are considered themselves
