our results present very good speedups and also show that no single allocation strategy is able to achieve the lowest execution times for all scenarios.
furthermore, we  propose a mechanism to compute grid nodes execution weight, adapting the chosen allocation policy to the current  computational power of the nodes.
the framework, called packageblast, provides an infrastructure to choose or  incorporate task allocation strategies.
in this paper, we propose an adaptive task allocation  framework to perform blast searches in a grid environment against sequence database segments.
