we use these new definitions in the proof of our main result for vertex-cover auctions via a  bootstrapping technique, which may be of independent interest.
we study the relationships between the different payment bounds, both for  general set systems and for specific set-system auctions, such as path auctions and vertex-cover auctions.
also, we consider two natural modifications of the definition of karlin et al., and we analyse the properties of the resulting  payment bounds, such as monotonicity, computational hardness, and robustness with respect to the draw-resolution rule.
moreover, we show how to transform any  truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation ratio.
we show that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible worst-case bound; this is the first auction for this problem to have these properties.
in this paper, we propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction for the vertex cover problem and bound its frugality ratio.
the ratio captures the extent to which the  mechanism overpays, relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction.
informally, the frugality ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired payment bound.
recently, karlin, kempe and tamir introduced a new  definition of frugality ratio for this problem.
examples of this setting include shortest-path auctions and vertex-cover auctions.
the  auctioneer"s goal is to hire a team and pay as little as possible.
in set-system auctions, there are several overlapping teams of agents, and a task that can be completed by any of these teams.
