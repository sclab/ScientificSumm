in environments comprising multiple domains, where  eventbrokers have different security credentials, we have  quantified how a trade-off can be made between performance and expressiveness.
our experiments show that i) by caching plaintext and  ciphertext content when possible, we are able to deliver  comparable performance to plaintext events, and ii) that  attribute encryption within an event incurs far less overhead than defining separate event types for the attributes that need different levels of protection.
in addition to providing attribute-level access control, attribute encryption enables partially authorised brokers to implement  contentbased routing based on the attributes that are accessible to them.
attribute level encryption can be implemented in order to enforce fine-grained access control policies.
this is particularly appropriate if broker-to-broker  connections are secured by default so that wire-sniffing is not an issue.
encryption causes an overhead, but i) there may be no  alternative when access control is required, and ii) the performance penalty can be lessened with implementation optimisations, such as passing cached plaintext content alongside encrypted content between brokers with identical security credentials.
event content encryption can be used to enforce an access control policy while events are in transit in the broker  network of a multi-domain publish/subscribe system.
