we show that our approach has a smaller overall  communication overhead than existing approaches for achieving the same degree of control over security in publish/subscribe networks.
we  demonstrate that the time and space overheads can be minimised by careful consideration of encryption techniques, and by the use of caching to decrease unnecessary decryptions.
key refresh allows us to ensure forward and backward security when event brokers join and leave the network.
this paper extends previous work to present and evaluate a secure multi-domain publish/subscribe  infrastructure that supports and enforces fine-grained access control over the individual attributes of event types.
as the number of  participants in the network increases, security becomes an  increasing concern.
large scale publish/subscribe systems are likely to employ  components of the event transport network owned by cooperating, but independent organisations.
publish/subscribe systems provide an efficient, event-based, wide-area distributed communications infrastructure.
