the rest of the paper is devoted to the proposed auction mechanism. 
next, we show the applicability of the theoretical framework to preferences in trading.
section 3 develops new multiattribute structures for mvf, supporting  generalized additive decompositions.
in section 2 we present essential background on our  representation framework, the measurable value function (mvf).
we then study the auction"s allocational, computational, and practical properties.
after laying out this  infrastructure, we employ this representation tool for the development of a multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to  express their complex preferences in gai format.
next, we build a direct, formally justified link from  preference statements over priced outcomes to a generalized additive decomposition of the wtp function.
that is, we should be able not only to compare outcomes but also decide whether the difference in quality is worth a given difference in price.
we first lay out a representation framework for preferences that captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute  configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each.
to this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.
to apply it for modeling values for certain outcomes, therefore, requires a reinterpretation for preference under certainty.
given its roots in multiattribute utility theory [13], 227 the gai condition is defined with respect to the expected utility function.
we employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive independence (gai), a model flexible enough to accommodate  interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired, yet  providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence can be limited.
the auction we propose also supports compact price spaces,  albeit for levels of clusters of attributes rather than singletons.
the price of a configuration is defined as the sum of the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount.
it collects sell bids per attribute level and for a single  discount term.
the other auction (ad) assumes additive buyer valuation and seller cost functions.
because nld maintains an  exponential price structure, it is suitable only for small domains.
pk  propose two types of iterative auctions: the first (nld) makes no  assumptions about traders" preferences, and lets sellers bid on the full multidimensional attribute space.
our approach is inspired by the  design of an iterative multiattribute procurement auction for additive preferences, due to parkes and kalagnanam (pk) [19].
we propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a flexible preference structure.
our goal, therefore, is to identify the subtler yet more widely applicable structured representations, and exploit these  properties of preferences in trading mechanisms.
on the other hand, fully general models are intractable, and it is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some structure.
in such cases an additive value function may not be able to provide even a reasonable approximation of real preferences.
similarly, the seller"s production characteristics (such as increasing access time is harder for larger hard drives) can easily violate additivity.
for example, the buyer may exhibit complementary preferences for size and access time (since the performance effect is more salient if much data is involved), or may view a strong  warranty as a good substitute for high reliability ratings.
in practice, however, interdependencies among natural attributes are quite common.
such additivity reduces the complexity of preference  specification exponentially (compared to the general discrete case), but  precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes.
for  example, several recent proposals for iterative multiattribute auctions [2, 3, 8, 19] require additive preference representations.
by far the most popular multiattribute form to adopt is the simplest: an additive representation where overall value is a linear combination of values associated with each attribute.
constructing and  communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical  multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some  simplified form.
in order to account for traders" preferences, the auction  mechanism must extract evaluative information over a complex domain of multidimensional configurations.
in addition, suppliers may offer different contract conditions such as warranty, delivery time, and service.
supplier offers may be evaluated not only over the price they offer, but also over various qualitative attributes such as volume, rpm, access time, latency, transfer rate, and so on.
for example, a procurement department of a company may use a multiattribute auction to select a supplier of hard drives.
rather than negotiating over a fully defined good or service, a  multiattribute mechanism delays commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified.
multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional, price-only mechanisms by facilitating the negotiation over a set of predefined attributes representing various non-price aspects of the deal.
