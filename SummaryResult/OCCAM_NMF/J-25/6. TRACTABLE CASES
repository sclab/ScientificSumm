the atomic securities are sold by insurers, each of whom  specialize in a different form of disaster cause. 
for example, the disjunctions may  correspond to insurance customers, who want an insurance  contract to cover all the potential causes of their asset loss.
although this example is contrived, its application is not entirely implausible.
this disjunction bid is part of a match iff p +p i qi ≥ k. evaluating whether this condition is satisfied by a subset of bids is quite straightforward.
let p be the price offered for a disjunction a1 ∨ · · · ∨ ak , and qi the maximal price offered for the respective negated disjuncts.
2. single negative events: ¯ai .
suppose, for example, that bids are limited to unit  quantities of securities of the following two forms: 1. disjunctions of positive events: a1 ∨ · · · ∨ ak .
although we have not systematically explored the possibilities, the potential for useful tractable cases certainly exists.
the logical question to ask in light of these complexity  results is whether further, more severe restrictions on the space of securities can enable tractable matching algorithms.
