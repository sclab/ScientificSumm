section 7 concludes with a summary and some ideas of future directions. 
section 6 discusses the possibility of tractable special cases.

section 4 briefly  discusses natural algorithms for solving the matching problem.
section 3 formally  describes our framework for compound securities, and defines the auctioneer"s matching problem.
section 2 presents some necessary background  information, motivation, and related work.
with log n events, the problem is  polynomial in the divisible case and np-complete in the indivisible case.
this σp 2-complete hardness holds even when the bidding language is  significantly restricted.
with n events, the matching problem is co-np-complete in the divisible case and σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.
let the length of the description of all the available securities be o(n).
we examine the computational complexity of the  auctioneer"s matching problem.
typically, the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own, only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders, but we also consider alternative formulations where the  auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk.
given a set of such bids, the auctioneer faces a complex matching problem to decide which bids are accepted for how many units at what price.
bids may also be divisible, meaning that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested quantity, or indivisible, meaning that bids must be fulfilled either completely or not at all.
another trader may bid to sell six units of a security a|c that pays off $1 iff a occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event c  occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if c does not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the  security is refunded) [5].
for example, given binary events a, b, and c, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security  denoted a ∧ ¯b ∨ c that pays off $1 iff the compound event a ∧ ¯b ∨ c occurs for thirty cents each.
so, for example, one unit of a security denoted acme100 might pay $1 iff acme"s stock is above $100 on january 4, 2004. an acme stock option as it would be defined on a  finan144 cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic securities.1 in this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for trading in compound securities markets with payoffs  contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including conditionals.
one unit of one arrow-debreu security pays off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur.
however, these can all be modeled as collections of more basic or atomic arrow-debreu  securities [1, 8, 20].
real securities markets have complex payoff structures with various triggers.
because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective  probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].
for example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.
second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the  likelihood of future outcomes.
or the owner of a house may purchase an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage to the house.
for example, the owner of a stock might buy a put option (the right to sell the stock at a particular price) in order to insure against a stock downturn.
first, they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.
the economic value of securities markets is two-fold.
examples include stock markets like nasdaq, options markets like cboe [17], futures markets like cme [30], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [11, 12], sports betting markets [7, 13, 32], horse racing markets [33], idea futures markets [16], decision markets [14] and even market games [4, 24, 25].
securities markets effectively allow traders to place bets on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions.
