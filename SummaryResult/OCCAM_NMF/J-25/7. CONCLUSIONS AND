acknowledgments we thank rahul sami for his help with section 5.4.4. we thank rahul, joan feigenbaum and robin hanson for useful discussions. 
a natural question is to determine whether a market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances this may occur.
with few exceptions [3, 22], little is known about computational  equilibriums.
4. we may consider a market to be in computational  equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find a strategy that increases utility.
3. exploring sharing rules for dividing the surplus, and incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms.
2. although matching is likely intractable, are there good heuristics that achieve matches in many cases or  approximate a matching?
• how do make the above choices in a game  theoretically sound way, taking into account the choices of other traders, their reasoning about other traders, etc.
153 • how to choose securities; that is, deciding on what collection of boolean formulas to offer to trade, subject to constraints or penalties on the number or complexity of bids.
many possible avenues for future work exist, including 1. analyzing the agents" optimization problem: • how to choose quantities and bid/ask prices for a collection of securities to maximizes one"s  expected utility, both for linear and nonlinear utility functions.
future directions we have analyzed the computational complexity of  matching for securities based on logical formulas.
