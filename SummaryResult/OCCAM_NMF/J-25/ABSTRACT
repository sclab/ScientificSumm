categories and subject descriptors f.2.2 [theory of computation]: analysis of algorithms and problem complexity-nonnumerical algorithms and problems; j.4 [computer applications]: social and  behavioral sciences-economics general terms algorithms, economics, theory. 
we briefly discuss matching algorithms and tractable special cases.
with log n events, the  problem is polynomial in the divisible case and np-complete in the indivisible case.
we show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe language restrictions on bids.
we show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-np-complete in the divisible case and Ïƒp 2-complete in the indivisible case.
we then analyze in  detail the auctioneer"s matching problem.
we develop and motivate the concept of a compound  securities market, presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples.
the tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents" and  auctioneer"s optimization problems.
a compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk  exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum.
buying or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit (in expectation) on subjective predictions.
we develop a framework for trading in compound securities: financial instruments that pay off contingent on the  outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic.
