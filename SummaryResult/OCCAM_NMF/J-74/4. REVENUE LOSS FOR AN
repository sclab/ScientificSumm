agent valuations are drawn from the uniform distribution. 
percentage of revenue lost for an honest seller agents second-price auction first-price auction (pc = 0.5) (pa = 0.5) 2 33 12 5 11 4.0 10 5.3 1.8 15 4.0 1.5 25 2.2 0.83 50 1.1 0.38 100 0.50 0.17 table 1: the percentage of expected revenue lost by an honest seller due to the possibility of cheating in the two settings considered in this paper.
while this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than agents actually cheating themselves.
however, even in this worst case, the percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than it is for the second-price auction in which pc = 1 2 , as shown in table 1.6 it turns out that setting pc = 0.2 would make the expected loss of these two settings comparable.
again considering the uniform distribution for agent types, it is not surprising that pa = 1 2 causes the seller to lose 79 the most revenue.
if pa = 1 (each agent cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price auction, and the seller"s expected revenue will be unchanged.
analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents may cheat is not so straightforward.
for the case in which agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by p c nâˆ’1+p c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest seller"s revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.
in a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave their bids.
although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.
the equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us to quantify this loss.
honest seller in both of the settings we covered, an honest seller suffers a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating.
