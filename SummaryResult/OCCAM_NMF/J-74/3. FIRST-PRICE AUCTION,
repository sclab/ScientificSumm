we do note, however, that the sign of the second  derivative of f(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 
unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing f(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).
it would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general  condition on f(·).
examples include f(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: f (θi) = −1, f(0) = 0, and f(1) = 1), and f(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .
it is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.
we also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (f(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).
example 1. in a first-price auction where f(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and n = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1"s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.
however, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.
in the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.
however, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce f(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should  actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.
it turns out that theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form f(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.
3.4 effects of overbidding for other distributions a natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.
in fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of theorem 5 and change a single agent j"s strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent i"s best response is to shave more than 1 n off of its bid.
it is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.
however, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.
this is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as nash and  bayesnash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.
obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0. the point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.
theorem 5. in a first-price auction where f(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = n−1+αj n θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = n−1 n θi.
note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.
in fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 n , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.
this result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.
corollary 4. in a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability pa , and f(θi) = θi, it is a  bayesnash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid  according to the strategy bi(θi) = n−1 n θi.
however, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.
the idea is that sacrificing some  potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.
since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agent"s probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is  natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.
recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = n−1 n θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.
a natural place to start is uniform distribution: f(θi) = θi.
theorem 3. in a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability pa , it is a bayes-nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 pa · f(bi(x)) + (1 − pa) · f(x) (n−1) dx pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − pa) · f(θi) (n−1) (8) 78 3.3 special case: uniform distribution since we could not solve equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of f(·).
since we have left f(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agent"s bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.
ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 equilibrium our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.
the expression for the utility of an honest agent in this  discriminatory auction is as follows.
it is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically  equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.
otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.
each agent knows the  probability pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.
, µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.
these selections are recorded by a vector of indicator  variables µa = (µa1 , .
with probability pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.
in the first stage, each agent"s payment rule is determined.
this intuition can be formalized as the following  discriminatory auction.
thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agent"s bid and every cheating agent"s type.
however, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.
one could imagine a scenario similar to an english auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.
it is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.
3.1 formulation it is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.
furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid.
this result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to  overbidding in a standard first-price auction.
this equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the  equilibrium strategy of honest agents.
after  revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an  arbitrary distribution f(·).
since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.
cheating agents we now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).
