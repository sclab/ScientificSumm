cryptographic methods are the standard weapon of choice here (see [1, 4, 9]). 
the goals often extend well beyond simply preventing cheating, including  properties such as anonymity of the bidders and nonrepudiation of bids.
an area of related work that can be seen as  complementary to ours is that of secure auctions, which takes the point of view of an auction designer.
an explicit derivation of the  equilibrium strategies then allows us relate first and second-price auctions.
our work differs in that we focus on the agents" strategies in a second-price auction for a given probability of cheating by the seller.
it is shown that, in equilibrium, only a seller with the maximum  probability of cheating would ever choose to run a second-price auction.
the bidders, who know the distribution from which the seller"s type is drawn, then place their bid.
the seller makes this choice after observing his type, which is his probability of having the opportunity and willingness to cheat in a second-price auction.
in their setting, the seller is a  participant in the bayesian game who decides between running a first-price auction (where profitable cheating is never  possible) or second-price auction.
the work most closely related to our first setting is [11], which also presents a model in which the seller may cheat in a second-price auction.
results on collusion in first and second-price auctions can be found in [8] and [3], respectively.
other types of collusion are of course related to the  general topic of cheating in auctions.
this issue is tackled in [7].
while the non-colluding agents would account for this possibility, as long as they are not certain of the collusion they will still be induced to shave more off of their bids than they would if the collusion did not take place.
unreasonable for bidders to be able to alter the perceived n arbitrarily, collusion provides an opportunity to decrease the perceived n by having only one of a group of colluding agents participate in the auction.
thus, the expected loss in profit could be much greater than the numbers that appear here.
while it is 6 note that we have not considered the costs of the seller.
bidders would obviously want to decrease the perceived number of agents in order to induce their competition to lower their bids.
the other interesting case of this form of cheating is by bidders in a first-price auction.
the analysis would then proceed in a similar manner as that of our cheating seller model.
of course, instead of assuming that the seller can always exploit this power, we could assume that it can only do so with some probability that is known by the agents.
if we make the natural assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium  bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed to any of the bidders.
thus, in equilibrium the agents would ignore the declared value of n, and bid according to their own prior beliefs about the number of agents.
however, if agents are aware that the seller has this power, then any communication about n to the agents is cheap talk, and furthermore is not credible.
in these cases, the seller could arbitrarily manipulate the perceived n. in a first-price  auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the perceived value of n in order to induce agents to bid closer to their true valuation.
for example, a bidder"s only source of information about n could be a counter that the seller places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller about the number of potential bidders who have indicated that they will participate.
however, in an online setting this  assumption is rather tenuous.
existing work covers another dimension along which we could analyze cheating: altering the perceived value of n. in this paper, we have assumed that n is known by all of the bidders.
