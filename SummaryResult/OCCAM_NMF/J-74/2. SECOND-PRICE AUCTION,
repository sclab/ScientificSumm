when pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now  welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = n−1 n θi. 
corollary 2. in a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability pc , and f(θi) = θi, it is a bayes-nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = n − 1 n − 1 + pc θi (6) this equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.
we now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: f(θi) = θi.
2.4 special case: uniform distribution another way to try to gain insight into equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.
furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the revenue equivalence theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in equation 5 is the  symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of theorem 1 in the appendix).
by adjusting pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction.
consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is  honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − pc it is the second-highest bid.
2.3 continuum of auctions an alternative perspective on the setting is as a  continuum between first and second-price auctions.
for example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − pc · θi 0 f (n−1) (x)dx f (n−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price  auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of pc = 0 and pc = 1.
the position of pc is perhaps surprising.
however, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.
in the case of pc = 0, this solution is not defined.
setting pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).
77 theorem 1. in a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability pc , it is a bayes-nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 f( n−1 p c ) (x)dx f( n−1 p c ) (θi) (5) it is useful to consider the extreme points of pc .
5 note that common knowledge is not necessary for the  existence of an equilibrium.
4 this simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve price before the auction begins.
formally, b∗ is a bayes-nash  equilibrium if: ∀i, θi, bi eθ−i,µc ui b∗ i (θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi ≥ eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi (4) 2.2 equilibrium we first present the bayes-nash equilibrium for an  arbitrary distribution f(·).
a vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a bayes-nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an  alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed.
because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a bayes-nash  equilibrium.
by pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price  (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) we assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.
ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) we will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.
the utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does.
pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.
the probability that the seller cheats, pc , is known by all agents.5 we can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows.
let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise.
on the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.
we assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 if the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.
fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.
an agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.
let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding  definition for b[1](θ−i).
the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).
3 we thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always  exists a pure strategy equilibrium.
, bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 we can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range.
we also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), .
a bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i. we can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i).
each agent knows its own type θi, but only the  distribution over the possible types of the other agents.
call the probability density function (pdf ) f(θi) = f (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf.
each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agent"s value for the good being auctioned.2 each agent"s type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) f over [0, 1], where f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. we assume that f(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the interval [0, 1].
2.1 formulation the setting consists of n bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller.
while no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively.
the formulation for this section will be largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating in a first-price auction.
cheating seller in this section, we consider a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after  observing all of the bids.
