second, there is a great diversity of data aggregation techniques, data correlation and analysis, and intrusion response that can be applied to the same environment; these techniques can be organized under several levels of complexity. 
this integration can be made under several scopes.
first, the information from multiple sources are analysed in an integrated way to search for distributed attacks.
with the proposed model for integration of idss in grids, the different idss of an environment (or multiple idss integrated) act in a cooperative manner improving the intrusion detection services, mainly in two aspects.
this entity can act in the scope 3 independently from others.
a third entity can be responsible for managing the security of several domains in a joint way.
the second scope, comprising several hosts of a domain can be managed by the administrator of the domain.
for example, the first scope can be managed by the local user of a host.
the didsog allows different levels to be managed by different entities.
if it is necessary to add a new analyser, it will be in the scope of several domains, it is enough to relate it to another resource of same scope.
if it is necessary to add a new host (sensor) to the didsog, it is enough to plug it to the first hierarchy of resources.
another feature of the hierarchical organization is the easy extension and integration with other domains.
an initial analyser will exist (complexity level 1) to which the sensor will send its data, and this analyser will then direct the data to the next step of the processing flow.
by carrying out a hierarchic relationship between the several chosen analysers for an environment, the sensor resource is not overloaded with the task to send the data to all the analysers.
therefore, the hierarchic structure of the didsog is maintained, facilitating its extension and integration with other domains of intrusion detection.
resources of higher complexity must be linked to resources of lower complexity.
each resource only knows the results of its processing and the destination to which it sends the results.
no resource has full knowledge about the complete data processing flow.
the division of scopes and the complexity levels make the processing of the data to be carried out in phases.
the complexity level 1 could be defined for analyses based on signatures, which are simpler techniques; the complexity level 2 for techniques based on behaviour, that require greater computational power; and the complexity level 3 for intrusion detection in applications, where the techniques are more specific and depend on more data.
the distinction between complexity levels can also be organized in order to integrate different techniques of intrusion detection.
in an analysis task, for example, the search for simple attacks can be made by resources of complexity 1, whereas the search for more complex attacks, that demands more time, can be performed by resources of complexity 2. with this, the analysis of the data is made by two resources.
the complexity levels allow the distribution of the processing between several resources inside the same scope.
for example, scope 1 can be related to a given set of hosts, scope 2 to another set of hosts, while scope 3 can be related to hosts from scopes 1 and 2. scopes can be defined according to the needs of each environment.
through the definition of scopes, resources can act on data of different source groups.
after the specification of the connector and the descriptor the new ids is integrated to the didsog.
if the integration of a new ids to an environment already configured is desired, it is enough to develop the connector for the desired ids and to specify the resource descriptor.
filters and generation of specific logs for each native ids or environment can also be incorporated to the connector.
adaptations, conversions of data types and auxiliary processes that native idss need are provided by the connector.
the connector component is also flexible in the didsog.
each native ids is integrated to the didsog through a connector component.
the descriptors define data flow desired for the resulting dids.
the didsog can be modelled in accordance with the needs of each environment.
the hierarchic organization of scope and complexity provides a high degree of flexibility to the model.
