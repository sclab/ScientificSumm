results and discussion are presented in section 5. conclusions and future work are discussed in section 6. 
the proposed model is presented in section 3. section 4 describes the development and a case study.
section 2 presents related work.
the next sections of this article are organized as follows.
the correlation of distributed logs is also relevant because the detection of distributed attacks depends on the correlation of the alert information generated by the different idss that compose the didsog.
auditing and monitoring services take care of the proper needs of the didss such as: secure storage, data analysis to detect intrusions, discovery of distributed sensors, and sending of alerts.
a dids needs services for the location of and access to distributed data from different idss.
these services are important for the implementation of a didsog.
some functions provided by grid middleware are [3]: (i) data management services, including access services, replication, and localisation; (ii) workflow services that implement coordinate execution of multiple applications on multiple resources; (iii) auditing services that perform the detection of frauds or intrusions; (iv) monitoring services which implement the discovery of sensors in a distributed environment and generate alerts under determined conditions; (v) services for identification of problems in a distributed environment, which implement the correlation of information from disparate and distributed logs.
grid middleware can thus be used to implement a great variety of services.
this characteristic is important for the integration of idss as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different idss.
the virtualisation of the environment through service interfaces allows the use of services without the knowledge of how they are actually implemented.
different implementations can be encapsulated by a service interface; this virtualisation allows the consistent access to resources in heterogeneous environments [3].
the service oriented architecture followed by grids (ogsa) allows the definition of interfaces that are adaptable to different platforms.
a grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a didsog, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized qos (quality of service).
each of the integrated idss is viewed by others as a resource accessed through the services that it exposes.
the proposed model enables heterogeneous idss to work in a cooperative way; this integration is termed didsog (distributed intrusion detection system on grid).
this article proposes a model for integration of idss by using computational grids.
the services in ogsa are specified through well-defined, open, extensible and  platformindependent interfaces, which enable the development of interoperable applications.
ogsa (open grid service architecture) provides the foundation for this service orientation in computational grids.
[4], grids can be viewed as a set of aggregate services defined by the resources that they share.
according to foster et al.
moreover, grid middleware provides means for secure access, management and allocation of remote resources; resource information services; and protocols and mechanisms for transfer of data [4].
grid computing aims to enable coordinate resource sharing in dynamic groups of individuals and/or organizations.
computational grids are appealing as they enable the development of distributed application and coordination in a distributed environment.
however, the realization of a dids requires a high degree of coordination.
research on didss has then received much interest, mainly because centralised idss are not able to provide the information needed to prevent such attacks [13].
didss (distributed intrusion detection systems) therefore started to emerge in early 90s [9] to allow the correlation of intrusion information from multiple hosts, networks or domains to detect distributed attacks.
• the interoperability/integration of different ids components would benefit the research on intrusion detection and speed up the deployment of idss as commercial products.
the integration of idss is then needed to correlate information from multiple networks to allow the identification of distributed attacks and or intrusions.
• attacks and intrusions generally originate from multiple networks spanning several administrative domains; these domains usually utilize different idss.
some reasons for integrating idss are described by the idwg (intrusion detection working group) from the ietf (internet engineering task force) [12] as follows: • many idss available in the market have strong and weak points, which generally make necessary the deployment of more than one ids to provided an adequate solution.
solutions for integrating heterogeneous idss (intrusion detection systems) have been proposed by several groups [6],[7],[11],[2].
