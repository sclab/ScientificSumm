the development of distributed strategy proof mechanisms for integration of idss is a challenge that we would like to tackle. 
idss from different organizations or administrative domains need incentives for joining a grid of intrusion detection services and for collaborating with other idss.
in addition to the integration of idss enabled by a grid middleware, the cooperation of heterogeneous idss can be viewed as an economic problem.
didsog presents new research opportunities that we would like to pursue, including: deployment of the model in a more realistic environment such as a grid; incorporation of new security services; parallel analysis of data by native idss in multiple hosts.
in contrast, the proposed model developed and simulated in this work, can shed some light into the question of integration of heterogeneous idss.
however, none deals with the integration of heterogeneous idss.
some work focus on either the development of didss on computational grids or the application of idss to computational grids.
related work presents cooperation between components of a specific dids.
this capability demonstrates that the idss integrated have resulted in a dids.
during the simulation, the different idss cooperated with one another in a distributed manner; however, in a coordinated way with an integrated view of the events, having, thus, the capability to detect distributed attacks.
the components of didsog architecture have served as base for the integration of the resources presented in the simulation.
various resources were modelled following the architecture components forming a grid of intrusion detection.
the communication and localization services provided by gridsim were used to integrate components of different resources.
analysis, correlation, aggregation and alert).
resources providing different intrusion detection services were integrated (e.g.
the integration of distinct idss could be observed through the simulated environment.
data from the sensor resources was read and this data was used to feed other resources of didsog.
the simulation demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed model.
based on the components of the architecture, several resources were modelled forming a grid of intrusion detection.
services for communication and localization were used to carry out the integration between components of different resources.
the components of the architecture of the didsog were developed and evaluated using the gridsim grid simulator.
a computational grid platform is used for the integration by providing the basic requirements for communication, localization, resource sharing and security mechanisms.
idss in didsog are encapsulated as grid services for intrusion detection.
this work thus proposed a model for composition of dids by integrating existing idss on a computational grid platform (didsog).
however, the incompatibility and diversity of ids solutions make such integration extremely difficult.
the integration of heterogeneous idss is important.
