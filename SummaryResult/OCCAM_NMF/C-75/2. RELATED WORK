local and distributed attacks can be detected through the integration of traditional idss while attacks particular to grids can be detected through the integration of grid idss. 
in contrast, didsog uses the grid to compose a dids by integrating specific idss; the resulting dids could however be used to identify attacks in a grid environment.
didsog does not aim at detecting intrusions in a grid environment.
scenarios demonstrating how a dids can execute on a grid environment are presented.
however, the possibility of applying heterogeneous detection systems is left for future work another dids for grids is presented by choon and samsudim [2].
homogeneous resources were used to simplify the development [11].
gridsim grid simulator was used for the validation of dids gida.
the dids gida (grid intrusion detection architecture) targets at the detection of intrusions in a grid environment [11].
the processing in phases [6][7] is also contemplated by didsog, which is enabled by the specification of several levels of processing allowed by the integration of heterogeneous idss.
[6][7] do not consider the integration of heterogeneous idss.
however, the resulting dids integrates heterogeneous idss whereas the didss upon grids presented by leu et al.
this work proposes the development of a dids upon a grid platform.
[6],[7] have used tools to generate several types of attacks - including tcp, icmp and udp flooding - and have demonstrated through experimental results the advantages of applying computational grids to idss.
leu et al.
[6] point out that idss developed upon grids platforms are less vulnerable to attacks because of the distribution provided for such platforms.
traditional idss or didss are generally coordinated by a central point; a characteristic that leaves them prone to attacks.
the first phase aims at the detection of momentary attacks, while the second phase is concerned with chronic or perennial attacks.
a two-phase processing architecture is presented.
[6] and [7] propose the use of globus toolkit for intrusion detection, especially for dos (denial of service) and ddos (distributed denial of service) attacks; globus is used due to the need to process great amounts of data to detect these kinds of attack.
there are proposals on integrating computational grids and idss [6],[7],[11],[2].
the hierarchy presented in [10] integrates homogeneous idss whereas the hierarchical architecture of didsog integrates heterogeneous idss.
each ids integrated to the didsog offers functionalities at a given level of the hierarchy and requests functionalities from idss from another level.
the integration proposed by didsog also follows a hierarchical architecture.
components in the same level of the hierarchy cooperate with one another.
the architecture comprises of several components for: monitoring, correlation, intrusion detection by statistics, detection by signatures and answers.
[10] presents a hierarchical architecture for a dids; information is collected, aggregated, correlated and analysed as it is sent up in the hierarchy.
the integration of heterogeneous idss to increase the variety of intrusion detection techniques in the environment is mentioned as future work [13] didsog thus aims at integrating heterogeneous idss [13].
more efficient techniques for analysis of great amounts of data in wide scale networks based on clustering and applicable to didss are presented in [13].
the flexibility, scalability, platform independence, reliability and security components discussed in [5] are achieved in didsog by using a grid platform.
the extensibility of dids didma and the integration with other idss are goals pursued by didsog.
however, the integration with existing idss and the development of security components are presented as future work [5].
didma architecture allows distributed analysis of events and can be easily extended by developing new agents.
didma [5] is a flexible, scalable, reliable, and  platformindependent dids.
