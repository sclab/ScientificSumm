a node serving too many nodes can either return fewer  responses to query packets or generate negative responses.
as a result, load balancing can be achieved via positive and negative  feedback.
in  addition, pheromone can be reduced by an explicit negative response, for instance, a reply packet returning from a node that is not  willing to provide a resource due to excessive workload.
each node also performs an implicit negative feedback for resources that have not been given a positive feedback for some time by regularly decreasing the pheromone in all of its pheromone table entries over time.
intuitively, the amount of pheromone increased is  inversely proportional to the distance the reply packet has traveled back, and other metrics, such as quality of the resource, could contribute to this amount as well.
in the hybrid scheme, an increase of pheromone serves as a positive feedback which indirectly guides query packets looking for similar  resources.
these packets will traverse away from the advertising node in a random walk manner up to a limited number of hops and advertise resource information to surrounding nodes in the same way as reply packets.
to perform proactive advertisement, each node periodically deploys an advertising packet containing a list of its available resources" ids.
to address this issue, the hybrid scheme also incorporates proactive advertisement in  addition to the reactive query.
in dense  networks, relatively large nodal degrees can have potential impacts on this random exploring mechanism.
since the hybrid discovery scheme neither relies on a manet routing protocol nor arranges nodes into a logical overlay, query packets are to traverse the actual network topology.
therefore, subsequent query packets looking for the same resource, when encountering this pheromone information, are then guided toward the same  destination with a small probability of taking an alternate path.
if such an entry does not exist, a new entry is added into the table.
the returning reply packet also  updates the pheromone table at each node on its return trip by  increasing the pheromone value in the entry whose resource id and neighbor id fields match the id of the discovered resource and the previous hop, respectively.
when a query packet  encounters a node with a satisfying resource, a reply packet is  returned to the querying node.
based on these probabilities, a next hop is  selected to forward the query packet to.
in addition, a small probability is also assigned to those neighbors with zero desirability to exercise the sporadic random walk primitive.
once the desirabilities of all valid next hops have been calculated, they are normalized to obtain the probability of choosing each neighbor.
if no such entry exists in the pheromone table, δ(r,n) is set to zero.
for a resource id r, the desirability of choosing a neighbor n, δ(r,n), is obtained from the pheromone value of the entry whose neighbor and  resource id fields are n and r, respectively.
when node a receives a query packet searching for a resource, it makes a decision to which neighbor it should forward the query packet by computing the desirability of each of the neighbors that have not been visited before by the same query packet.
figure 1 illustrates an example of a neighbor table and a  pheromone table maintained by node a having four neighbors.
this table is initially empty, and is updated by a reply packet generated by a successful query.
the pheromone table maintains the mapping of a resource id and a neighbor id to a pheromone value.
the neighbor table maintains a list of all current neighbors obtained via a neighbor discovery protocol.
table and pheromone table.
to allow intermediate nodes to make a decision on where to  forward query packets, each node maintains two tables: neighbor 1 the assumption of unique id is made for brevity in exposition, and resources could be specified via attribute-value assertions.
in addition to discovering the ‘identity" of the node providing the requested resource, it may be also necessary to discover a ‘route" leading to this node for further interaction.
advertisement packets can also be used to proactively inform other nodes about what resources are available at each node.
upon receiving such a query packet, a reply packet is generated by the node providing the requested resource.
initially, when a node wants to discover a resource, it deploys query packets, which carry the corresponding resource id, and randomly explore the network to search for the requested resource.
we assume that each resource is associated with a unique id1 .
we propose a cross-layer, hybrid resource discovery scheme that relies on the multiple interactions of query, reply and  advertisement packets.
