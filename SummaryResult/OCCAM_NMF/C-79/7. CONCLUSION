in particular, the scheme offers the features of (1) cross-layer design of p2p systems, which allows the routing process at both the p2p and the network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead, (2) scalability and mobility support, which minimizes the use of global flooding operations and adaptively combines proactive resource  advertisement and reactive resource discovery, and (3) load balancing, which facilitates resource replication, relocation, and division to achieve load balancing. 
the paper describes a design paradigm that uses the functional primitives of positive/negative feedback and sporadic random walk to design robust resource discovery and distribution schemes over manets.
either way, constructing an overlay will potentially suffer from the scalability problem.
on the other hand, if a proactive routing protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast  control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of  bandwidth usage.
in the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be  discovered on demand.
specifically, overlay routing relies on the network-layer routing  protocols.
however, deploying overlay over manets may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth usage.
to facilitate resource discovery and distribution over manets, one approach is to designing peer-to-peer (p2p) systems over manets which constructs an overlay by organizing peers of the system into a logical structure on the top of manets" physical topology.
