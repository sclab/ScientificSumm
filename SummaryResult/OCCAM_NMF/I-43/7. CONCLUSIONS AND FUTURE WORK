in future work, we intend to proceed with the development of dynamics-based controllers for these problems. 
however, dbc in  general has no such limitations, and readily enables the formulation of evasion games.
this prevents direct application of emt to such problems as rendezvous-evasion games (e.g., [6]).
as enumerated in section 4.2, emt has a number of  limitations, such as difficulty in dealing with negative dynamic  preference.
since emt exhibits the key features of the general dbc  framework, as well as polynomial time complexity, we used the  multitarget version of emt [15] to demonstrate that the class of area sweeping problems naturally lends itself to dynamics-based  descriptions, as instantiated by our experiments in the tag game  domain.
in fact, emt can be seen as a specific case of dbc parameterization, which employs a greedy action selection procedure.
we show that a recently developed technique of extended markov tracking (emt) [13] is an instantiation of dbc.
with respect to the deviation of actual system dynamics from the target dynamics.

optimality of dbc plans of action are measured the sixth intl.
dbc  formulates the task of planning as support of a specified target system  dynamics, which describes the necessary properties of change within the environment.
in this paper, we have presented a novel perspective on the  process of planning and control in stochastic environments, in the form of the dynamics based control (dbc) framework.
