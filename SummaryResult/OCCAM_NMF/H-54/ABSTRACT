based on the trec platform, we show that appropriate use of  domainspecific knowledge in a proposed conceptual retrieval model yields about 23% improvement over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the genomics track of trec 2006. categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval]: information search and retrieval - retrieval models, query formulation, information filtering.
the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution are examined.
this paper presents a study of incorporating domain-specific knowledge (i.e., information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain) in an information retrieval (ir) system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature.
