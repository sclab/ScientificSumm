finally, our conceptual ir model is actually based on complex concepts because some biomedical meanings, such as biological processes, are represented by multiple simple concepts. 
as another example, the way in which implicitly related concepts are extracted in this paper is significantly different from that given in [19].
this is to ensure that our conceptual model of retrieval can be applied.
for example, in our pseudo-feedback process, we require that the unit of feedback is a concept and the concept has to be of the same semantic type as a query concept.
third, although some of the techniques seem similar to previously published ones, they are actually quite different in details.
second, we have studied more types of  domainspecific knowledge than previous researchers and carried out more comprehensive experiments to look into the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.
in summary, our approach differs from previous works in four important ways: first, we present a case study of conceptual retrieval in the domain of genomics, where many knowledge resources can be used to improve the performance of biomedical ir systems.
also, our similarity function is very different from that in [13].
although the retrieval model is similar, we made a study in the domain of genomics, in which the problem structure and task knowledge is not as well-defined as in the domain of clinical medicine [18].
they have shown that appropriate use of semantic knowledge in a conceptual retrieval framework can yield substantial improvements.
[13] presented a good study of the role of knowledge in the document retrieval of clinical medicine.
although the assumption is similar, our conceptual model is based on the biomedical concepts, not phrases.
the retrieval model in [15] emphasized the similarity between a query and a document on the phrase level assuming that phrases are more important than individual words when retrieving documents.
besides, we have implemented a  postranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations, which will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the abbreviation ambiguity.
besides, we have implemented a post-ranking step to reduce the number of incorrect matches of abbreviations, which will hopefully decrease the negative impact caused by the abbreviation ambiguity.
in the biomedical domain, this kind of ambiguity of query terms is relatively less frequent, because, although the abbreviations are highly ambiguous, general biomedical concepts usually have only one meaning in the thesaurus, such as umls, whereas a term in wordnet usually have multiple meanings (represented as synsets in wordnet).
when these synonyms having multiple meanings are added to the query, substantial irrelevant documents are retrieved.
this has been due to ambiguity of the query terms which have different meanings in different contexts.
little benefit has been shown in [20].
in their studies, queries were expanded using the lexical semantic relations such as synonyms, hypernyms, or hyponyms.
[20][15] utilized wordnet, a database of english words and their lexical relationships developed by princeton university, for query expansion in the non-biomedical domain.
in addition, under the conceptual retrieval framework, we examined more comprehensively the effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.
our system utilized more types of domain-specific knowledge, including hyponyms, hypernyms and implicitly related concepts.
[21] used a similar approach for generating lexical variants of gene symbols and reported significant improvements.
they have shown that query expansion with acronyms and lexical variants of gene symbols produced the biggest improvement, whereas, the query expansion with gene information from gene databases deteriorated the performance.
among these groups, [3] assessed both thesaurus-based knowledge, such as gene information, and non thesaurus-based knowledge, such as lexical variants of gene symbols, for query expansion.
as summarized in [8][9][10], many groups utilized domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval effectiveness.
the genomics track in trec provides a common platform to evaluate methods and techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information retrieval.
a critical difference between our work and those in [11][1] is that our retrieval model is based on concepts, not on individual words.
we used mesh, entrez gene, and other non-thesaurus knowledge resources such as an abbreviation database for query expansion.
[1] expanded queries with phrases and umls concepts determined by the metamap, a program which maps biomedical text to umls concepts, and no significant improvement was shown.
based on a word-statistical retrieval system, [11] used definitions and different types of thesaurus relationships for query expansion and a deteriorated performance was reported.
[11][1] assessed query expansion using the umls metathesaurus.
many studies used manually-crafted thesauruses or knowledge databases created by text mining systems to improve retrieval effectiveness based on either word-statistical retrieval systems or conceptual retrieval systems.
