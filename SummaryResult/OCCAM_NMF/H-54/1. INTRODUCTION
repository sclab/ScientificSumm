related works are given in section 5 and finally, we conclude the paper in section 6. 
the techniques are introduced in section 3. in section 4, we present the experimental results.
this paper is organized as follows: problem statement is given in the next section.
2. we examine the effects of utilizing concepts and of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution.
based on this approach, our system achieved significant improvement (23%) over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the genomics track of trec 2006.
this paper makes two contributions: 1. we propose a conceptual approach to utilize domain-specific knowledge in an ir system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature.
in the conceptual retrieval model presented in this paper, the similarity between a query and a document is measured on both concept and word levels.
a concept could be a word, such as the gene symbol prnp, or a phrase, such as mad cow diseases.
in this paper, concepts are entry terms of the ontology medical subject headings (mesh), a controlled vocabulary maintained by nlm for indexing biomedical literature, or gene symbols in the entrez gene database also from nlm.
in some recent studies [13][15], positive results have been reported for this hypothesis.
intuitively, retrieval on the level of concepts should outperform bag-of-words approaches, since the semantic relationships among words in a concept are utilized.
pubmed and many other biomedical systems [8][9][10][13] also make use of domain-specific knowledge to improve retrieval effectiveness.
for example, given a query what is the role of gene prnp in the mad cow disease?, expanding the gene symbol prnp with its synonyms prp, prpsc, and prion protein, more relevant documents might be retrieved.
we assume that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge might improve the effectiveness of retrieval.
domain-specific knowledge, in this paper, refers to information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain.
we approached the problem by utilizing domain-specific knowledge in a conceptual retrieval model.
a passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the html paragraph tag (i.e., <p> or </p>).
systems from participating groups are expected to find relevant passages within the full-text documents.
the document collection contains 162,259 highwire full-text documents in html format.
the queries were collected from real biologists and they are expressed as complex questions, such as how do mutations in the huntingtin gene affect huntington"s disease?.
the genomics track of the 2006 text retrieval conference (trec) provides a common platform to assess the methods and techniques proposed by various groups for biomedical information retrieval.
while nlm does maintain an experimental tool for free-text queries [6], it is still based on pubmed keyword search.
however, information needs of biologists, in some cases, are expressed as complex questions [8][9], which pubmed is not designed to handle.
keyword search in pubmed is effective if the query is well-crafted by the users using their expertise.
for example, if one desires documents on the use of the drug propanolol in the disease hypertension, a typical pubmed query might be propanolol and hypertension, which will return all the documents having the two keywords.
pubmed allows for keyword search by using boolean operators.
for most biologists, pubmed, an online service of u.s. national library of medicine (nlm), is the most commonly used tool for searching the biomedical literature.
biologists search for literature on a daily basis.
