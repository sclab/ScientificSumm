this is a passage-level information retrieval problem with the attempt to put biologists in contexts where relevant information is provided. 
a passage could be a part of a sentence, a sentence, a set of consecutive sentences or a paragraph (i.e., the whole span of text that are inside of <p> and </p> html tags).
a passage is defined as any span of text that does not include the html paragraph tag (i.e., <p> or </p>).
the output of the system is a list of passages ranked according to their similarities with the query.
the document collection contains 162,259 highwire full-text documents in html format.
features of the queries: 1) they are different from the typical web queries and the pubmed queries, both of which usually consist of 1 to 3 keywords; 2) they are generated from structural templates which can be used by a system to identify the query components, the biological object or process.
how does a mutation in ret influence thyroid function?
how does a mutation in gene influence biological process?
how do hmg and hmgb1 interact in hepatitis?
how do genes interact in organ function?
what effect does the insulin receptor gene have on tumorigenesis?
what effect does gene have on biological process?
what is the role of drd4 in alcoholism?
table 2 query templates and examples in the genomics track of trec 2006 template example what is the role of gene in disease?
these questions were derived from four templates (table 2).
a question might involve multiple biological objects (m) and multiple biological processes (n).
as described in [8], these questions all have the following general format: biological object (1..m) relationship ←⎯⎯⎯⎯→ biological process (1..n) (1) where a biological object might be a gene, protein, or gene mutation and a biological process can be a physiological process or disease.
the query set used in the genomics track of trec 2006 consists of 28 questions collected from real biologists.
we describe the queries, document collection and the system output in this section.
