all in all, these results deliver a way for relating abstract system specifications (i.e., institutions as sets of norms) to specifications that are closer to an implemented system (i.e.,  organizational structures). 
the last result presented concerned the definition of a formal correspondence between institution and organization specifications (definition 7), which provides a formal way for switching between the two paradigms.
multi-graphs has then been used to represent the specification of organizational structures (definition 6).
tboxes has been used to represent the specifications of  institutions (definition 3) and their infrastructures (definition 6),  providing therefore a transition system semantics for a number of  institutional notions (examples 1-7).
the predominant formal tool has been description logic.
the paper aimed at providing a comprehensive formal  analysis of the institutional metaphor and its relation to the  organizational one.
