categories and subject descriptors f.4.1 [mathematical logic and formal languages]: modal logic; i.2.11 [distributed artificial intelligence]: multiagent systems; f.2.11 [distributed artificial intelligence]: coherence and  coordination general terms theory. 
it is also shown how such a refinement process can be fully formalized and it is therefore amenable to rigorous verification.
as a result, it is shown how institutional norms can be refined to  constructsorganizational structures-which are closer to an implemented  system.
the paper presents a formal semantics for the notion of institution and its components (abstract and concrete norms, empowerment of agents, roles) and defines a formal  relation between institutions and organizational structures.
in order to develop systems actually  implementing institutions and organizations, formal methods should take the place of heuristic ones.
up to now, the way institutions and organizations have been used in the development of open systems has not often gone further than a useful heuristics.
