in section 4 some conclusions follow. 
the extended framework is then studied in relation to the formalism for representing organizational structures presented in [11].
in section 3 the  framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an institution.
concretely, in section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and  implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.
the main result of the paper  consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap between abstract norms and concrete system specifications.
aim of the present paper is to fill this gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal  foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its relation to the organizational one.
what is lacking at the moment for the design and development of open mass is, in our opinion, something that can play the role that bdi-like formalisms have played for the design and development of single-agent architectures.
as a matter of fact, those theories have fostered the production of architectures and programming languages.
have been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as, for instance, bdictl ([22]) and karo ([17]).
this has been the case for agent programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from folk psychology (belief, intention, desire, knowledge, etc.)
obtain a formal semantics.
it is our thesis that the application of those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are treated formally, that is, once notions such as norm, role, structure, etc.
in many cases, however, the application of these conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high level design of the systems.
in mass the  application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system design has proven to be useful for the development of  methodologies and tools.
the opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of  organizational and social theory to distributed ai and multiagent  systems (mass) has long been advocated ([8]).
