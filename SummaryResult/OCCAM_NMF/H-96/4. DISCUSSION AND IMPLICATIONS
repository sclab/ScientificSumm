the development of such a system represents part of our ongoing work in this area. 
since erf is not traditionally used until toward the end of the search it may be possible to incorporate both irf and erf into the same ir system, with irf being used to gather evidence until subjects decide to use erf.
the findings suggest that searchers interact differently for irf and erf.
without an analysis of this type it would not have been possible to establish the existence of such patterns of behaviour.
the results also show the effects of task complexity on the irf process and how rapidly subjects reach their most interactive point.
the results suggest that irf is used more in the middle of the search than at the beginning or end, whereas erf is used more towards the end.
through analysis of this nature we can build a more complete picture of how searchers used rf and how this varies based on the rf method.
4.3 search stage we also analysed the effects of search stage on the use and usefulness of irf.
these subjects may understand the rf process less, but may be more willing to sacrifice control over feedback in favour of irf, a process that they perceive more positively.
all subjects felt more in control with erf than irf, but for inexperienced subjects this did not appear to affect their overall preferences29 .
however, irf was generally liked by both subject groups (perhaps because it removed the burden of providing relevance information) and erf was generally preferred by experienced subjects more than inexperienced subjects (perhaps because it allowed them to specify which results were used by the system when generating term recommendations).
that is, the average ratings assigned to irf were generally more positive than those assigned to erf.
our analysis revealed a general preference across all subjects for irf over erf.
4.2 search experience we analysed the affect of search experience on the utility of irf.
monitoring such interaction across a number of studies may lead to a set of criteria that could help ir systems automatically detect task complexity and tailor support to suit.
for example, on the irf system we noticed that as task complexity falls search behaviour shifts from results interface to retrieved documents.
also, in the design of search systems it implies that since different types of rf may be appropriate for different task complexities then a system that could automatically detect complexity could use both erf and irf simultaneously to benefit the searcher.
it implies that in the design of user studies involving erf or irf systems care should be taken to include tasks of varying complexities, to avoid task bias.
the association between rf method and task complexity has implications for the design of user studies of rf systems and the rf systems themselves.
in these situations subjects appeared to prefer irf as they do not need to make a relevance decision to obtain the benefits of rf, i.e., term suggestions, whereas in erf they do.
therefore they struggled to find relevant 26 erf: χ2 (2) = 2.22, p = .33; irf: χ2 (2) = 7.73, p = .021 (friedman rank sum tests); irf: all pair-wise comparisons significant at z ≥ 1.77, all p ≤ .038 (dunn"s post-hoc tests) 27 all t(48) ≥ 786, all p ≤ .002, (wilcoxon signed-rank test) 28 irf: r = .712, p < .001, erf: r = .695, p = .001 (pearson correlation coefficient) information and were unable to communicate rf to the search system.
when the search was more complex subjects rarely found results they regarded as completely relevant.
from observations and subject comments we perceived that when using erf systems subjects generally forgot to provide the feedback but also employed different criteria during the erf process (i.e., they were assessing relevance rather than expressing an interest).
4.1 search task the results of our study showed that erf was preferred for less complex tasks and irf for more complex tasks.
in this section we discuss the implications of the findings presented in the previous section for each research question.
