in this paper we use data derived from that experiment to study factors affecting the utility of irf. 
the main experiment from which the data are taken was designed to test techniques for selecting query modification terms and techniques for displaying retrieval results [13].
this study aims to establish when, and under what circumstances, irf performs well in terms of its use and the query modification terms selected as a result of its use.
(iii) is irf equally used and does it generate terms that are equally useful at all search stages?
(ii) is the use of and perceived quality of terms generated by irf affected by the level of search experience of system users?
the study aims to investigate the factors that affect irf, in particular three research questions: (i) is the use of and perceived quality of terms generated by irf affected by the search task?
in this paper we present a study into the use and effectiveness of irf in an online search environment.
irf has been shown to display mixed effectiveness because the factors that are good indicators of user interest are often erratic and the inferences drawn from user interaction are not always valid [7].
irf has been implemented either through the use of surrogate measures based on interaction with documents (such as reading time, scrolling or document retention) [7] or using interaction with browse-based result interfaces [5].
implicit relevance feedback (irf) [7] has been proposed as a way in which search queries can be improved by passively observing searchers as they interact.
however, in practice rf techniques have been underutilised as they place an increased cognitive burden on searchers to directly indicate relevant results [10].
techniques such as relevance feedback (rf) [11] have been proposed as a way in which the ir system can support the iterative development of a search query by suggesting alternative terms for query modification.
as the quality of the query submitted to the system directly affects the quality of search results, the issue of how to improve search queries has been studied extensively in ir research [6].
however, it is also possible to offer support to searchers for different search activities, such as selecting the terms to present to the system or choosing which search strategy to adopt [3, 8]; both of which can be problematic for searchers.
and msn search, the system generally only supports the retrieval of potentially relevant documents from the collection.
in the traditional interaction metaphor employed by web search systems such as yahoo!
information retrieval (ir) systems are designed to help searchers solve problems.
