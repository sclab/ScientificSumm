it is only after such studies have been run and analysed in this way can we develop an understanding of irf that allow it to be successfully implemented in operational ir systems. 
studies of this nature are important to establish the circumstances where a promising technique such as irf are useful and those when it is not.
our conclusions per each research question are: (i) irf is generally more useful for complex search tasks, where searchers want to focus on the search task and get new ideas for their search from the system, (ii) irf is preferred to erf overall and generally preferred by inexperienced subjects wanting to reduce the burden of providing rf, and (iii) within a single search session irf is affected by temporal location in a search (i.e., it is used in the middle, not the beginning or end) and task complexity.
appear to have some effect on the use and effectiveness of irf, although the interaction effects between factors are not statistically significant.
our overall conclusion was that all factors 29 this may also be true for experienced subjects, but the data we have is insufficient to draw this conclusion.
these factors were search task complexity, the subjects" search experience and the stage in the search.
we aimed to answer three research questions about factors that may affect the provision and usefulness of irf.
in this paper we have presented an investigation of implicit relevance feedback (irf).
