an interesting open question is whether this approximate best-response calculation can be leveraged to find an  approximate nash equilibrium. 
computing player i"s best response can be viewed as maximizing a submodular function, and thus a best  response can be (1 − 1/e) ≈ 0.63 approximated greedily [14].
selecting a minimum-sized set of these queries is hard.)
(this proof proceeds by  reduction from set cover; intuitively, for sufficiently low query costs, player i must fully identify the actual world through his queries.
thus even computing a best response for player i is hard.
conversely, it is np-hard to compute a nash  equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|w|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and player ii has only a single available strategy.
(for example, we can efficiently solve games in which every groundset element γ ∈ γ has δ({γ}) = ω(m − m), where m and m denote the maximum and minimum payoffs to any player in any world.)
when one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions.
), and world-identity queries (is the world w ∈ w the real world?).
), strategy queries (what is my vector of payoffs if i play strategy ai?
natural groundsets include comparison queries (if my  opponent is playing strategy aii, would i prefer to play ai or ˆai?
here we take the query cost to be a linear function, so that δ(q) = p γ∈q δ({γ}).
another interesting setting for socratic games is when the set q of available queries is given by q = p(γ)-i.e., each player chooses to make a set q ∈ p(γ) of queries from a specified groundset γ of queries.
efficiently finding equilibria in such settings remains an open problem.
(for example, one might consider a setting in which the algorithm has only a sampling oracle for the posterior distributions envisioned by bergemann and v¨alim¨aki.)
it is also interesting to consider settings in which the game"s queries are specified by a compact representation of the relevant probability distributions.
our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.
with this  modification, our unobservable-query model becomes equivalent to the model of bergemann and v¨alim¨aki [4, 5], in which the result of a query is a posterior distribution over the worlds.
however, one could instead model a query as probabilistically mapping the set of possible worlds into the set of signals.
in this paper, we model a query as deterministically partitioning the possible worlds into  subsets that the query cannot distinguish.
another natural extension is the model where query  results are stochastic.
an -approximate nash equilibrium is a strategy profile α so that no player can increase her payoff by an additive by deviating from α. finding approximate nash equilibria in both adaptive and non-adaptive socratic games is an interesting direction to pursue.
the question of approximation raises interesting questions even in non-adaptive socratic games.
although there are important technical distinctions between adaptive socratic games and these problems, approximation techniques from this literature may apply to socratic games.
special cases of adaptive socratic games are closely related to single-agent problems like minimum latency [1, 7, 26],  determining strategies for using priced information [9, 29, 37], and an online version of minimum test cover [18, 50].
our techniques carry over to o(1) rounds of unobservable queries, but it would be interesting to  compute equilibria in socratic games with adaptive observable queries or with ω(1) rounds of unobservable queries.
socratic games can be extended to allow players to make adaptive queries, choosing subsequent queries based on  previous results.
(socratic games are succinct games of superpolynomial type, so papadimitriou"s results [56] do not imply correlated  equilibria for them.)
in a correlated  equilibrium, a player"s expected payoff generally depends on his recommended strategy, and thus a player may deviate in stage 1 so as to land in a stage-2 game where he has been given a better than average recommended response.
the difficulty is that when a player considers a deviation from his recommended query, he already knows his recommended response in each of the stage-2 games.
suppose the players receive recommended queries and responses.
an efficient algorithm to find correlated equilibria in  general socratic games seems more attainable.
there has, however, been some algorithmic success in finding nash equilibria in restricted classical settings (e.g., [21, 46, 47, 57]); we might hope to extend our results to analogous socratic games.
efficiently finding nash equilibria in socratic games with non-strategically zero-sum worlds is probably difficult  because the existence of such an algorithm for classical games has been shown to be unlikely [10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 27, 54, 55].
