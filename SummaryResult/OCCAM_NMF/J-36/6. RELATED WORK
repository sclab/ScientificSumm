they present a model in which players must solve a computationally intractable valuation problem, using costly computation to learn some hidden parameters, and results for auctions and bargaining games in this model. 
a  notable exception is the work of larson and sandholm [41, 42, 43, 44] on mechanism design for interacting agents whose computation is costly and limited.
most of this work differs significantly from our own in that it considers single-agent planning as opposed to the game-theoretic setting.
(see, e.g., [69].)
this issue can also be viewed as another perspective on the general question of exploration versus exploitation that arises often in ai: when is it better to actively seek  additional information instead of exploiting the knowledge one already has?
this tradeoff has been explored in a variety of other contexts; a sampling of these contexts includes aggregating results 156 from delay-prone information sources [8], doing approximate reasoning in intelligent systems [72], deciding when to take the current best guess of disease diagnosis from a  beliefpropagation network and when to let it continue inference [33], among many others.
the fundamental question in socratic games is deciding on the comparative value of making a more costly but more informative query, or concluding the data-gathering phase and picking the best option, given current information.
recent work has been done in developing algorithms for  restricted classes of posgs, most notably classes of  cooperative posgs-e.g., [20, 30]-which are very different from the competitive strategically zero-sum games we address in this paper.
partially observable stochastic games (posgs) are a  general framework used in ai to model situations of multi-agent planning in an evolving, unknown environment, but the  generality of posgs seems to make them very difficult [6].
the work on bounded rationality [23, 24, 53, 58] differs from the models that we consider here in that instead of putting hard limitations on the computational power of the agents, we instead restrict their a priori knowledge of the state of the world, requiring them to spend time (and therefore money/utility) to learn about it.
the typical model of this  socalled bounded rationality [36, 64, 66] is to postulate bounds on computational power in computing the consequences of a strategy.
the observation that human players typically do not play rational strategies has inspired some attempts to model partially rational players.
finally, we note the connection between socratic games and modal logic [34], a formalism for the logic of possibility and necessity.
see, e.g., the work of skyrms [68] for a philosophical  perspective on the role of deliberation in strategic situations.
when there are more options, a decision-maker must spend more time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.
the present work explores an economic explanation of this phenomenon: information is not free.
the psychology literature explores a number of  explanations: people may miscalculate their opportunity cost by comparing their choice to a component-wise maximum of all other options instead of the single best alternative [65], a new option may draw undue attention to aspects of the other options [67], and so on.
(see also [19].)
however, recent research has found that more choices tend to decrease happiness: for  example, students choosing among extra-credit options are more likely to do extra credit if given a small subset of the choices and, moreover, produce higher-quality work [35].
prima facie, a rational agent"s happiness given an added option can only increase.
in this section, we briefly review some of these social-science experiments and then discuss technical approaches related to socratic game theory.
our work was initially motivated by research in the social sciences indicating that real people seem (irrationally)  paralyzed when they are presented with additional options.
