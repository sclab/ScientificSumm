we can prove that g is strategically zero sum by choosing labels (i, aj i ) := log2 uj and (ii, aj ii) := log2 vj. 
for (iii ⇒ i), if rank(mg ) = 1, then mg = u · vt .
for (ii ⇒ iii), let ci be the n-element column vector with jth component 2 (i,a j i ) ; then ci · cii t = mg .
(i ⇒ ii) is immediate; every pure  strategy is a trivially mixed strategy.
then the following are equivalent: (i) g is strategically zero sum; (ii) there exist labels (i, ai) for every player i ∈ {i,ii} and every pure strategy ai ∈ ai such that, for all pure strategies a ∈ a, we have ui(a) + uii(a) = (i, ai) + (ii, aii); and (iii) rank(mg ) = 1. proof sketch.
let mg be the ni-by-nii matrix whose i, j th entry mg (i,j) satisfies log2 mg (i,j) = ui(ai i , aj ii) + uii(ai i , aj ii).
, ani i }.
theorem 3.1. consider a game g = a, u with ai = {a1 i , .
for  completeness, we give a characterization of classical strategically zero-sum games in terms of the rank of a simple matrix  derived from the game"s payoffs, allowing us to efficiently  decide if a given game is strategically zero sum and, if it is, to compute the labels (i, ai).
it is not immediately obvious that one can efficiently  decide if a given game is strategically zero sum.
note that any constant-sum game is strategically zero sum as well.
a game a, u is strategically zero sum if there exist labels (i, ai) for every player i and every pure strategy ai ∈ ai 152 such that, for all mixed-strategy profiles α, we have that the sum of the utilities satisfies ui(α)+uii(α) = x ai∈ai αi(ai)· (i, ai)+ x aii∈aii αii(aii)· (ii, aii).
it is interesting to note that two socratic games with the same queries and strategically equivalent worlds are not necessarily strategically equivalent.
such games are called strategically zero sum and were introduced by moulin and vial [51], who describe a notion of strategic equivalence and define  strategically zero-sum games as those strategically equivalent to zero-sum games.
thus the sum of  payoffs does depend on players" choice of strategies, but not on the interaction of their choices-i.e., for fixed functions gi and gii, we have ui(q, f) + uii(q, f) = gi(qi, fi) + gii(qii, fii) for all strategies q, f .
however, this game still has significant structure: the sum of payoffs varies only because of varying query costs.
the sum of the players" payoffs varies depending upon their strategies, because different queries incur different costs.
however, this classical game is not constant sum.
we can view a socratic game g with constant-sum worlds as an exponentially large classical game, with pure  strategies make query qi and respond according to fi.
