a generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 
the accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.
as future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the spotlight system.
this error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using gps devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].
our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.
the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.
our localization system is reusable, i.e.
all the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single spotlight device.
our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.
in this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called spotlight.
