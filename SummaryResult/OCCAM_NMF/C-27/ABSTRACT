to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a sub-meter localization error, obtained in an outdoor environment, without equipping the wireless sensor nodes with specialized ranging hardware.
a sensor network, with any number of nodes, deployed in a 2500m2 area, can be localized in under 10 minutes, using a device that costs less than $1000.
through performance evaluations of a real system deployed outdoors, we obtain a 20cm localization error.
we evaluate the performance of our system in deployments of mica2 and xsm motes.
we demonstrate that a high accuracy in localization can be achieved without the aid of expensive hardware on the sensor nodes, as required by other localization systems.
our system uses the spatio-temporal properties of well controlled events in the network (e.g., light), to obtain the locations of sensor nodes.
in this paper, we formally describe, design, implement and evaluate a novel localization system, called spotlight.
the problem of localization of wireless sensor nodes has long been regarded as very difficult to solve, when considering the realities of real world environments.
