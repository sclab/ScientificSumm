the spotlight system combines the advantages and does not suffer from the disadvantages of the two localization classes. 
the spotlight system has a long effective range (1000"s meters) and does not require any infrastructure or additional hardware for sensor nodes.
our system requires a line of sight between a single device and the sensor nodes, and the map of the terrain where the sensor field is located.
to the best of our knowledge, spotlight is the first range-free localization scheme that works very well in an outdoor environment.
langendoen and reijers present a detailed, comparative study of several localization schemes in [16].
several studies [11] [32] [34] have emphasized the challenges that real environments pose.
the majority of range-free localization schemes have been evaluated in simulations, or controlled environments.
the dv-* family of localization schemes [21], uses the hop count from known beacon nodes to the nodes in the network to infer the distance.
the global coordinate system [20], developed at mit, uses apriori knowledge of the node density in the network, to estimate the average hop distance.
propose apit, a scheme in which each node decides its position based on the possibility of being inside or outside of a triangle formed by any three beacon nodes heard by the node.
in [13], he et al.
propose in [4] a localization scheme, called centroid, in which each node localizes itself to the centroid of its proximate beacon nodes.
bulusu et al.
this approach is called range-free and it attempts to obtain location information from the proximity to a set of known beacon nodes.
to overcome the challenges posed by the range-based localization schemes, when applied to sensor networks, a different approach has been proposed and evaluated in the past.
however, the high localization accuracy, achievable by these schemes is very desirable.
the hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small range, all are difficult compromises, and it is hard to envision cheap, unreliable and resource-constraint devices make use of range-based localization solutions.
for wireless sensor networks ranging is a difficult option.
the reported errors in localization vary from 2.2m to 9.5m, depending on the type (centralized vs. distributed) of the least square scaling algorithm used.
[15].
acoustic ranging for localization is also used by kwon et al.
implement a distributed system (using acoustic ranging) which locates a sniper in an urban terrain.
in [30], simon et al.
a similar toa technique is employed in [3].
[27], employs time of arrival (toa) ranging techniques that require extensive hardware and solving relatively large nonlinear systems of equations.
ahlos, proposed by savvides et al.
the cricket location-support system [25] can achieve a location granularity of tens of centimeters with short range ultrasound transceivers.
this approach produces smaller localization errors, at the cost of additional hardware.
a more precise ranging technique uses the time difference between a radio signal and an acoustic wave, to obtain pair wise distances between sensor nodes.
elnahrawy [8] provides strong evidence of inherent limitations of localization accuracy using rssi, in indoor environments.
formulate the localization problem as an on-line estimation in a nonlinear dynamic system and proposes a robust extended kalman filter for solving it.
in [24], pathirana et al.
propose mal, a localization method in which a mobile node (moving strategically) assists in measuring distances between node pairs, until the constraints on distances generate a rigid graph.
in [26], priyantha et al.
in [29], sichitiu proposes a solution in which the nodes that receive the beacon construct, based on the rssi value, a constraint on their position estimate.
the sensor nodes that receive the beacons, apply different algorithms for inferring their location.
they all share the idea of using a mobile beacon.
solutions that use rssi and do not require beacon nodes have also been proposed [5] [14] [24] [26] [29].
in a similar approach, motetrack [17] distributes the reference rssi values to the beacon nodes.
the location of a mobile user is estimated within a few meters.
the radar system [2] uses the rssi to build a centralized repository of signal strengths at various positions with respect to a set of beacon nodes.
the rssi has been an attractive solution for estimating the distance between the sender and the receiver.
due to the high cost and non-negligible form factor of the ranging hardware, these solutions can not be simply applied to sensor networks.
laser range finder or ultrasound.
the reported localization errors are on the order of tens of centimeters, when using specialized ranging hardware, i.e.
in the field of robotics, it has been studied extensively [9] [10].
the localization problem is a fundamental research problem in many domains.
in this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the received signal strength indicator (rssi)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.
