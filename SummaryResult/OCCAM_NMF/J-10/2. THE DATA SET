since we don"t record the username of the reviewer, we will also say that the ith review in our data set was submitted by user i. when we need to consider only the reviews of a given hotel, h, we will use (ri(h) , ti(h) ) to denote the ith review about the hotel h. 
135 reviews are indexed according to the variable i, such that (ri , ti ) is the ith review in our database.
5} for the features f ∈ f = {o, r, s, c, v, f, l, n}; note that the overall rating, ro, is abusively recorded as the rating for the feature overall(o); • t is the textual comment that accompanies the review.
2.1 formal notation we will formally refer to a review by a tuple (r, t) where: • r = (rf ) is a vector containing the ratings rf ∈ {0, 1, .
all data was collected by crawling the tripadvisor site in september 2006.
the typical length of the textual comment amounts to approximately 200 words.
for each feature we record the numerical rating given by the user, or 0 when the rating is missing.
however, we also selected the features food(f), location(l) and noise(n) because they are referred to in a significant number of textual comments.
only the features rooms(r), service(s),  cleanliness(c) and value(v) are rated by a significant number of users.
tripadvisor does not require users to submit anything other than the overall rating, hence a typical review rates few  additional features, regardless of the discussion in the textual comment.

table 1: a summary of the data set.
note that not all hotels have a star-rating.
table 1 presents the number of hotels considered in each city, the total number of reviews recorded for each city, and the  distribution of hotels with respect to the star-rating (as  available on the tripadvisor site).
for each city we considered all hotels that had at least 10 reviews, and recorded all reviews.
we selected three cities for this study: boston, sydney and las vegas.
figure 1 shows the page for a popular boston hotel whose name (along with advertisements) was explicitly erased.
below the name of the hotel, tripadvisor displays the address of the hotel, general information (number of rooms, number of stars, short description, etc), the average overall rating, the tripadvisor ranking, and an average rating for each feature.
the reviews contain: • information about the author of the review (e.g., dates of stay, username of the reviewer, location of the  reviewer); • the overall rating (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest); • a textual review containing a title for the review, free comments, and the main things the reviewer liked and disliked; • numerical ratings (from 1, lowest, to 5, highest) for different features (e.g., cleanliness, service, location, etc.)
the reviews for a given hotel are displayed as a list (ordered from the most recent to the oldest), with 5 reviews per page.
users can search the site by giving the hotel"s name and location (optional).
tripadvisor indexes hotels from cities across the world, along with reviews written by travelers.
we use in this paper real hotel reviews collected from the popular travel site tripadvisor.
