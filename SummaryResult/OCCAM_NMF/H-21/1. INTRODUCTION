this result is in contrast with prior  findings in query classification [20], but is supported by research in mainstream text classification [5]. 
we found that crawling the search results yields deeper knowledge and leads to greater improvements than mere summaries.
we also report the results of a thorough  empirical study of different voting schemes and different depths of knowledge (e.g., using search summaries vs. entire crawled pages).
since our taxonomy is  considerably larger, the classification problem we face is much more difficult, making the improvements we achieve particularly notable.
the  empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methodology for  using external knowledge achieves greater improvements than those previously reported.
the taxonomy used in this work is two orders of  magnitude larger than that used in prior studies.
first, we build the query classifier directly for the target  taxonomy, instead of using a secondary auxiliary structure; this greatly simplifies taxonomy maintenance and development.
the main contributions of this paper are as follows.
they also used a separate ancillary taxonomy for web documents, so that an extra level of indirection had to be employed to establish the correspondence between the ancillary and the main taxonomies [18].
specifically, earlier works in the field used very small query classification taxonomies of only a few dozens of nodes, which do not allow ample specificity for online  advertising [11].
however, these  studies had a number of shortcomings, which we overcome in this paper.
more  recent studies [18, 21] also attempted to gather some  additional knowledge from the web.
early studies in query interpretation focused on query augmentation through external dictionaries [22].
consequently, in this work we focus on the classification of rare queries, whose correct classification is likely to be particularly beneficial.
knowing which taxonomy nodes are most relevant to the given query will aid us to provide the same type of support for rare queries as for frequent queries.
a natural choice for such  aggregation is to classify the queries into a topical taxonomy.
therefore, we need to  aggregate such queries in some way, and to reason at the level of aggregated query clusters.
however, the tail queries simply do not have enough occurrences to allow statistical learning on a per-query basis.
furthermore, the aggregate volume of such queries provides a substantial opportunity for income through on-line advertising.1 searching and advertising platforms can be trained to yield good results for frequent queries, including auxiliary data such as maps, shortcuts to related structured  information, successful ads, and so on.
while individual queries in this long tail are rare, together they account for a considerable mass of all searches.
the volume of queries in today"s search engines follows the familiar power law, where a few queries appear very often while most queries appear only a few times.
another important aspect of our work lies in the choice of queries.
this additional overhead is minimal, and therefore the use of search results to improve query classification is entirely feasible in run-time.
thus, at run-time we only need to run the voting procedure, without doing any crawling or  classification.
note that in a practical implementation of our  methodology within a commercial search engine, all indexed pages can be pre-classified using the normal text-processing and indexing pipeline.
our empirical evaluation confirms that using web search results in this manner yields substantial improvements in the accuracy of query classification.
finally, we use these result-page classifications to classify the original query.
we crawl the web pages pointed by these urls, and classify these pages.
for the purpose of this study we first  dispatch the given query to a general web search engine, and collect a number of the highest-scoring urls.
certainly, not all results are equally relevant, and thus we use  elaborate voting schemes in order to obtain reliable knowledge about the query.
to this end, we employ the pseudo relevance feedback paradigm, and assume the top search results to be relevant to the query.
following the heuristic described above, we  propose to use the search results themselves to gain additional insights for query interpretation.
search engines index colossal amounts of information, and as such can be viewed as very comprehensive repositories of knowledge.
for instance, in the example above, sd450 brings pages about canon cameras, while nc4200 brings pages about compaq laptops, hence to a human the intent is quite clear.
of course, the sheer volume of search queries does not lend itself to human supervision, and therefore we need alternate sources of knowledge about the world.
observe, however, that in many cases a human looking at a search query and the search query  results does remarkably well in making sense of it.
the problem of query classification is extremely difficult owing to the brevity of queries.
given such classifications, one can directly use them to  provide better search results as well as more focused ads.
in this study we present a methodology for query  classification, where our aim is to classify queries onto a commercial taxonomy of web queries with approximately 6000 nodes.
for instance, knowing that the query sd450 is about cameras while nc4200 is about laptops can obviously lead to more focused advertisements even if no advertiser has specifically bidden on these particular queries.
at the same time, better understanding of query  meaning has the potential of boosting the economic underpinning of web search, namely, online advertising, via the sponsored search mechanism that places relevant advertisements  alongside search results.
therefore, using additional external knowledge to augment the queries can go a long way in improving the search results and the user experience.
commercial search engines do a remarkably good job in  interpreting these short strings, but they are not (yet!)
various studies estimate the average length of a search query between 2.4 and 2.7 words, which by all  accounts can carry only a small amount of information.
one thing, however, has remained constant: people use very short queries.
in its 12 year lifetime, web search had grown  tremendously: it has simultaneously become a factor in the daily life of maybe a billion people and at the same time an eight billion dollar industry fueled by web advertising.
