finally, we draw conclusions in section 6. 
we establish the heat diffusion model (hdm) on various cases in section 3, and propose diffusionrank in section 4. in section 5, we describe the data sets that we worked on and the experimental results.
in the next section, we give a brief literature review on various related ranking techniques.
the rest of the materials are organized as follows.
this paper focuses on the link-based method.
one  example is the trustrank [7], a link-based method, in which the link structure is utilized so that human labelled trusted pages can propagate their trust scores trough their links.
link analysis methods are also employed to handle the link stuffing problem.
for example, see [5, 12].
to successfully apply machine learning methods, we need to dig out some useful textual features for web pages, to mark part of the web pages as either spam or non-spam, then to apply supervised learning techniques to mark other pages.
machine learning methods are employed to handle the keyword  stuffing.
there are two methods  being employed to combat the web spam problem.
from the viewpoint of the search engine  managers, the web spam is very harmful to the users" evaluations and thus their preference to choosing search engines because people believe that a good search engine should not return irrelevant or low-quality results.
from the viewpoint of the web site operators who want to increase the ranking value of a particular page for search engines, keyword stuffing and link stuffing are being used widely [7, 12].
the reason for the increasing amount of web spam is explained in [12]: some web site operators try to influence the positioning of their pages within search results because of the large fraction of web traffic originating from searches and the high potential monetary value of this traffic.
it is reported that  approximately 70% of all pages in the .biz domain and about 35% of the pages in the .us domain belong to the spam category [12].
the manipulation problem is also called the web spam, which refers to hyperlinked pages on the world wide web that are created with the intention of misleading search engines [7].
while the pagerank algorithm [13] has proven to be very effective for ranking web pages, inaccurate pagerank  results are induced because of web page manipulations by  people for commercial interests.
