the readers can find that our model is a generalization of pagerank in order to resist web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of trustrank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper. 
all the above topics are related to our work.
in these work, the input data is considered to lie in a special structure.
recently, the idea of heat kernel on a manifold is borrowed in applications such as dimension reduction [3] and classification [9, 10, 14].
heat kernel is used to  describe the amount of heat that one point receives from  another point.
in a medium, heat always flow from position with high temperature to position with low temperature.
2.4 heat diffusion heat diffusion is a physical phenomena.
while the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general  personalized pagerank in [17] are unknown in the web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons.
from the data points on such a manifold, an undirected weighted graph is created, then the weight matrix is given by the gaussian kernel smoothing.
the data points represented as vectors in euclidean space are considered to be drawn from a manifold.
2.3 manifold ranking in [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was  proposed.
although there are many variations of pagerank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], trustrank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for  combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a  comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with pagerank and diffusionrank.
moreover, the initial input of x is also set to be g. the justification for the inverse pagerank and the solid experiments support its advantage in combating the web spam.
the second part is to utilize the biased pagerank, in which the stochastic distribution g is set to be shared by all the trusted pages found in the first part.
the first part is the seed selection algorithm, in which the inverse  pagerank was proposed to help an expert of determining a good node.
2.2 trustrank trustrank [7] is composed of two parts.
when the concept of random jump is introduced, the matrix form is changed to x = [(1 − α)g1t + αa]x, (1) where α is the probability of following the actual link from a page, (1 − α) is the probability of taking a random jump, and g is a stochastic vector, i.e., 1t g = 1. typically, α = 0.85, and g = 1 n 1 is one of the standard settings, where 1 is the vector of all ones [6, 13].
or in matrix terms, x = ax.
the web is modelled by a directed graph g in the pagerank algorithms, and the rank or importance xi for page vi ∈ v is defined recursively in terms of pages which point to it: xi = (j,i)∈e aijxj, where aij is assumed to be 1/dj if there is a link from j to i, and 0 otherwise.
pagerank tries to find such average importance based on the web link structure, which is considered to contain a large amount of statistical data.
however, the average importance of all readers can be considered as an objective matter.
2.1 pagerank the importance of a web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the reader"s interests, knowledge and attitudes [13].
ii and di denote the in-degree and the out-degree of page i respectively.
, vn}, e = {(vi, vj) | there is an edge from vi to vj}.
denote a static graph by g = (v, e), where v = {v1, v2, .
for our convenience, we first give some notations.
all the mentioned ranking algorithms are  established on a graph.
as in previous work [7, 13], we focus on ranking methods solely determined by hyperlink structure of the web graph.
the importance of a web page is determined by either the textual content of pages or the hyperlink structure or both.
