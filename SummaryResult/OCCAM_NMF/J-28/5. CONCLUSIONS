it is particularly interesting that we are able to compute the  payments to n agents in a vcg-based mechanism in worst-case time o(t log n), where t is the time complexity to compute the  solution to a single allocation problem. 
our scheme is both approximately efficient and approximately strategyproof within any specified factor ε > 0. as such it is an example of computationally tractable ε-dominance result, as well as an  example of a non-trivial but approximable allocation problem.
we presented a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the single-good multi-unit auction problem, using marginal decreasing piecewise constant bidding language.
