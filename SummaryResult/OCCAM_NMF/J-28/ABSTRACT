the maximal possible gain from  manipulation to a bidder in the combined scheme is bounded by /(1+ )v , where v is the total surplus in the efficient outcome.
second, we embed this approximation scheme within a vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg) mechanism and compute payments to n agents for an  asymptotic cost of o(t log n).
first, we develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the multi-unit allocation problem, which computes a (1 +  )approximation in worst-case time t = o(n3 / ), given n bids each with a constant number of pieces.
the bidding language in our auctions  allows marginal-decreasing piecewise constant curves.
we present an approximately-efficient and  approximatelystrategyproof auction mechanism for a single-good multi-unit allocation problem.
