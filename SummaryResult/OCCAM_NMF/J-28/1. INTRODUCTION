ausubel [1] has proposed an ascending-price multi-unit auction for buyers with marginal-decreasing values [1], with an interpretation as a primal-dual algorithm [2]. 
the focus of this  paper is also different: it investigates the equilibrium prices using the demand and supply curves, whereas our focus is on efficient mechanism design.
[12] address double auctions, where multiple buyers and sellers trade a divisible good.
kalagnanam et al.
this earlier work  formulates the problem as a general mixed integer linear program, and gives some empirical results on simulated data.
[7] have studied a similar procurement problem, but for a different volume discount model.
eso et al.
schummer [21] and parkes et al [19] have previously  considered ε-dominance, in the context of economic impossibility results, for example in combinatorial exchanges.
baum & shenker [8] have defined the concept of strategically faithful approximations, and proposed the study of  approximations as an important direction for algorithmic mechanism  design.
vcg mechanism do have a natural self-correcting property, though, because a useful  manipulation to an agent is a reported value that improves the total value of the allocation based on the reports of other agents and the agent"s own value.
2 however, this may not be an example of what feigenbaum & shenker refer to as a tolerably-manipulable mechanism [8]  because we have not tried to bound the effect of such a  manipulation on the efficiency of the outcome.
feigenminimum-lot size constraints from the buyers.
nisan & ronen [18] discussed approximate vcg-based mechanisms, but either appealed to  particular maximal-in-range approximations to retain full  strategyproofness, or to resource-bounded agents with information or  computational limitations on the ability to compute strategies.
[15]  propose a greedy and strategyproof approximation to a single-minded combinatorial auction problem.
for instance, lehmann et al.
the idea of using approximations within mechanisms, while retaining either full-strategyproofness or ε-dominance has received some previous attention.
we identify a non-trivial but approximable allocation problem with an expressive  exclusiveor bidding language-the bid taker in our setting is allowed to accept at most one point on the bid curve.
although some polynomial-time cases have been identified for the cap [6, 20], introducing an expressive exclusive-or bidding language quickly breaks these special cases.
[6]).
the combinatorial allocation problem (cap) is both np-complete and inapproximable (e.g.
1.1 related work there has been considerable interest in recent years in  characterizing polynomial-time or approximable special cases of the general combinatorial allocation problem, in which there are  multiple different items.
section 5 concludes.
section 4 defines the approximation scheme for the payments in the vcg mechanism.
section 3 provides the generalized knapsack formulation for the multi-unit allocation problems and introduces the fully polynomial time approximation scheme.
we also prove our claims about ε-strategyproofness.
section 2 formally defines the forward and reverse auctions, and defines the vcg mechanisms.
as such, this is an example of a computationally-tractable ε-dominance result.2 in practice, we can have good confidence that bidders without good information about the bidding  strategies of other participants will have little to gain from attempts at manipulation.
this means that a bidder can gain at most ( ε 1+ε )v from a  nontruthful bid, where v is the total surplus from the efficient  allocation.
the approximate vcg mechanism is ( ε 1+ε )-strategyproof for an approximation to within (1 + ) of the optimal allocation.
specifically, in the reverse auction, suppose that c(i) is the minimal cost for procuring m units with all sellers i, and c(i \ i) is the minimal cost without seller i. then, the  constant α is defined as an upper bound for the ratio c(i \i)/c(i), over all sellers i. this upper-bound tends to 1 as the number of sellers increases.
we compute  approximate vcg payments in worst-case time o(αt log(αn/ε)), where α is a constant that quantifies a reasonable no-monopoly assumption.
given this scheme, a straightforward computation of the vcg payments to all n agents requires time o(nt).
for instance, the classic 0/1 knapsack is a special case of this problem.1 we model the 1 however, the problem can be solved easily by a greedy scheme if we remove all capacity constraints from the seller and all 166 allocation problem as a novel and interesting generalization of the classic knapsack problem, and develop a fully  polynomialtime approximation scheme, computing a (1 + )-approximation in worst-case time t = o(n3 /ε), where each bid has a fixed number of piecewise constant pieces.
the computational problem is interesting, because even with marginal-decreasing bid curves, the underlying allocation  problem turns out to (weakly) intractable.
this is an example of the budget-deficit problem that often occurs in efficient mechanism design [17].
otherwise, either the auction must run at a loss in these instances, or the buyer cannot be expected to voluntarily choose to participate.
however, as we discuss in section 2, the application of the vcg-based approach is limited in the reverse direction to instances in which the total payments to the sellers are less than the value of the outcome to the buyer.
the vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg)  mechanism has a number of interesting economic properties in this setting, including strategyproofness, such that truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for buyers in the forward auction and sellers in the reverse auction, and allocative efficiency, such that the  outcome maximizes the total surplus in the system.
we consider the computational complexity of implementing the vickrey-clarke-groves [22, 5, 11] mechanism for the  multiunit auction problem.
the forward variation models, for example, an auction to sell excess inventory in flexible-sized lots.
a buyer can also express a lower bound, or minimum lot size, on the number of units she demands.
in the forward auction, we consider a single seller with m units of a good and n buyers, each with a marginal-decreasing piecewise-constant valuation function.
circuit boards, power  suppliers, toner cartridges), with flexible-sized lots.
the reverse variation models, for example, a procurement auction to obtain raw materials or other services (e.g.
in  addition, each supplier can also express an upper bound, or capacity constraint on the number of units she can supply.
in the reverse auction, we consider a single buyer with a demand for m units of a good and n suppliers, each with a marginal-decreasing piecewise-constant cost function.
we consider both a reverse auction variation and a forward auction variation, and propose a compact and  expressive bidding language that allows marginal-decreasing piecewise constant curves.
the auction settings considered in our paper are  motivated by recent trends in electronic commerce; for instance, corporations are increasingly using auctions for their strategic sourcing.
our scheme is both approximately efficient and approximately  strategyproof.
in this paper we present a fully polynomial-time  approximation scheme for the single-good multi-unit auction problem.
