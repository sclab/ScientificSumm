article 7 section 3 describes techniques we applied to achieve effective utilization, even in the face of fluctuating resource  availability and/or demand. 
effective resource utilization is the desired system  condition since it ensures that end-to-end qos requirements of the uav-based multimedia system are met and utilization of both system resources, i.e., network bandwidth and  computational power, are within their desired utilization bounds.
over-utilization is generally undesirable since the quality of the received video (such as resolution and frame rate) and timeliness properties (such as latency and jitter) are degraded and may result in an unstable (and thus  ineffective) system.
this condition can arise from loss of resources - network bandwidth and/or  computing power at base station, end receiver or at uav - or may be due to an increase in resource demands by  applications.
over-utilization of system resources occurs when the  current resource utilization is higher than the desired upper bound on resource utilization.
for example, residual cpu and network bandwidth can be used to deliver better quality video (e.g., with greater resolution and higher frame rate) to end receivers.
these  residual resources can be used to increase the qos of the  applications.
in this system condition, residual system resources (i.e., network bandwidth and  computational power) are available in large amounts after meeting end-to-end qos requirements of applications.
under-utilization of system resources occurs when the  current resource utilization is lower than the desired lower bound on resource utilization.
based on this definition, we can classify system conditions as being either under, over, or effectively utilized.
we refer to the current level of system resource utilization as the system condition.
since resource availability significantly affects qos, we use current resource utilization as the primary indicator of  system performance.
for example, since a stream from an emergency response application is of higher importance than a video stream from a surveillance application, it  receives more resources end-to-end.
in our study, emergency response  applications belong to qos-enabled and surveillance applications belong to best-effort class.
qos-enabled class of applications have higher priority over best-effort class of application.
two classes of applications - qos-enabled and best-effort - use the multimedia system infrastructure described above to transmit video to their respective receivers.
resource requirements and availability of resources are subjected to dynamic changes.
the bandwidth of the link between the base station and the end receiver is limited, but more stable than the  bandwidth of the wireless network.
the wireless network bandwidth available to transmit video captured by uavs to base stations also depends on the wireless  connectivity between the uavs and the base station, which in-turn depend on dynamic factors such as the speed of the uavs and the relative distance between uavs and base stations.
the computing power required by the video capture and encoding tasks depends on dynamic factors, such as speed of the uav, speed of the subject (if the subject is mobile), and distance between uav and the subject.
2.2 dre multimedia system rresources there are two primary types of resources in our dre multimedia system: (1) processors that provide  computational power available at the uavs, base stations, and end receivers and (2) network links that provide communication bandwidth between uavs, base stations, and end receivers.
ity effectively.
in contrast, we treat qos  requirements such as video frame rate and picture resolution as softer qos requirements and modify these video properties adaptively to handle dynamic changes in resource  availabil2 although hard and soft are often portrayed as two discrete requirement sets, in practice they are usually two ends of a continuum ranging from softer to harder rather than two disjoint points.
hard qos requirements should be met by the underlying system at all times, whereas soft qos requirements can be missed occasionally.2 for our case study, we treat qos requirements such as latency and jitter as harder qos requirements and strive to meet these requirements at all times.
these qos requirements can be  classified as being either hard or soft.
our multimedia system case study has the following  endto-end real-time qos requirements: (1) latency, (2)  interframe delay (also know as jitter), (3) frame rate, and (4) picture resolution.
properties of the compressed video, such as  resolution and frame-rate determine both the quality and the resource requirements of the video.
each compression scheme is characterized by its resource requirement, e.g., the computational power to (de)compress the video signal and the network bandwidth required to transmit the compressed video signal.
common video compression schemes are  mpeg1, mpeg-2, real video, and mpeg-4.
significant improvements in video encoding/decoding and (de)compression techniques have been made as a result of recent advances in video encoding and compression  techniques [14].
(3) sinks (command and control center), where the received video is again processed to remove noise, then  decoded and finally rendered to end user via graphical displays.
(2)data distributor (base station), where the video is processed to remove noise, followed by  retransmission of the processed video to the next stage in the pipeline.
