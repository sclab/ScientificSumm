these variables are modified by hyarm to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved  application qos. 
the dre multimedia system as described in section 2 is an example dre system that offers both  continuous (picture resolution) and discrete set (frame-rate) of control variables.
hyarm can therefore be applied to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of control variables.
hyarm handles both continuous control variables, such as picture resolution, and discrete control variable, such as discrete set of frame rates.
the control variables in such systems are therefore intrinsically discrete.
while this assumption holds for certain classes of systems, there are many classes of dre systems, such as avionics and total-ship computing environments that only support a finite a priori set of  discrete configurations.
although existing fcs algorithms have shown promise, these algorithms often assume that the system has continuous control variable(s) that can continuously be adjusted.
these algorithms provide robust and analytical performance assurances despite uncertainties in resource availability and/or demand.
fcs  algorithms are modeled and designed using rigorous  controltheoretic methodologies.
fcs algorithms dynamically adjust resource allocation by means of software feedback control loops.
one such approach is feedback control scheduling (fcs) [2, 11].
a survey of these techniques is presented in [1].
these techniques aid in  overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly and result in a rigidly scheduled system that adapts poorly to change.
a number of control theoretic approaches have been  applied to dre systems recently.
