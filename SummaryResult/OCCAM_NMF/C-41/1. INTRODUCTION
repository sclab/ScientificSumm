the remainder of the paper is organized as follows:  section 2 describes the architecture, functionality, and resource utilization model of our dre multimedia system case study; section 3 explains the structure and functionality of hyarm; section 4 evaluates the adaptive behavior of hyarm via  experiments on our multimedia system case study; section 5 compares our research on hyarm with related work; and section 6 presents concluding remarks.
our results show that (1) hyarm ensures  effective system resource utilization and (2) end-to-end qos requirements of higher priority applications are met, even in the face of fluctuations in workload.
we have  implemented hyarm atop the ace orb (tao) [13], which is an implementation of the real-time corba  specification [12].
we achieve this by adapting the resolution of the transmitted video, which is modeled as a continuous variable, and by changing the frame-rate and the  compression, which are modeled by discrete actions.
in our case study, which involves a distributed real-time video distribution system, the task of adaptive  resource management is to control the utilization of the  different resources, whose utilizations are described by  continuous variables.
hyarm is based on hybrid control theoretic techniques [8], which provide a theoretical framework for designing  control of complex system with both continuous and discrete dynamics.
to meet these requirements, we have  developed the hybrid adaptive resource-management  middleware (hyarm), which is an open-source1 distributed  resource management middleware.
in open dre systems, adaptive middleware must make such modifications dependably, i.e., while meeting  stringent end-to-end qos requirements, which requires the  specification and enforcement of upper and lower bounds on system resource utilization to ensure effective use of  system resources.
objectives of dynamic modifications include optimizing system responses to changing environments or  requirements, such as changing component interconnections, power-levels, cpu and network bandwidth availability,  latency/jitter, and workload.
static  modifications are carried out to reduce footprint, leverage  capabilities that exist in specific platforms, enable functional  subsetting, and/or minimize hardware/software infrastructure dependencies.
a promising approach to meeting these end-to-end qos requirements effectively, therefore, is to develop and apply adaptive middleware [10, 15], which is software whose functional and qos-related properties can be modified either statically or dynamically.
overutilization of these system resources can yield unpredictable and unstable behavior, whereas under-utilization can yield excessive system cost.
achieving end-to-end real-time quality of service (qos) is particularly important for open distributed real-time and embedded (dre) systems that face resource constraints, such as limited computing power and network bandwidth.
