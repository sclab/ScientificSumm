overall, hyarm ensures efficient, predictable, and adaptive resource management for dre systems. 
our empirical  results indicate that hyarm ensures (1) efficient resource  utilization by maintaining the resource utilization of system  resources within the specified utilization bounds, (2) qos  requirements of qos-enabled applications are met at all times.
we evaluated the performance of hyarm in a system composed of three distributed resources and two classes of applications with two applications each.
we employed hyarm to a  representative dre multimedia system that is implemented using real-time corba and corba a/v streaming service.
hyarm employs hybrid control techniques to  provide the adaptive middleware capabilities, such as resource monitoring and application adaptation that are key to  providing the dynamic resource management capabilities for open dre systems.
this paper described hyarm, an adaptive middleware, that provides effective resource management to dre  systems.
to meet end-to-end qos in dynamic environments, dre systems can benefit from an adaptive middleware that monitors system resources, performs efficient application workload  management, and enables efficient resource provisioning for  executing applications.
these systems increasingly run in open environments, where  resource availability is subject to dynamic change.
