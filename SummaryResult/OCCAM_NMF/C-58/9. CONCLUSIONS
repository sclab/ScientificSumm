we build our system by extending ideas from astrolabe and dhts to achieve (i) scalability with respect to both nodes and attributes through a new aggregation abstraction that helps leverage dht"s internal trees for aggregation, (ii) flexibility through a simple api that lets applications control propagation of reads and writes, (iii) administrative isolation through simple augmentations of current dht algorithms, and (iv) robustness to node and network  reconfigurations through lazy reaggregation, on-demand reaggregation, and tunable spatial replication.
for large scale systems,  hierarchical aggregation is a fundamental abstraction for scalability.
this paper presents a scalable distributed information  management system (sdims) that aggregates information in large-scale networked systems and that can serve as a basic building block for a broad range of applications.
