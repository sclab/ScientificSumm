finally, it would be interesting to study real-life instances of the social task allocation problem, and see how they  relate to the randomly generated networks of different types studied in this paper.
this may help to model changing business relations and incentivize agents to follow the protocol.
a third interesting topic for further work is the addition of reputation information among the agents.
we are  interested in seeing how such interactions will affect the  performance of task allocation in different social networks.
our future work may allow agents to reallocate (sub)tasks.
in the current algorithm we assume that agents can only contact their neighbors to request resources, which may  explain why our algorithm performs not as good in the  scalefree networks as in the small-world networks.
in our future work, we would also like to address some of the related issues in game theory, such as strategic agents, and show desirable  properties of a distributed protocol in such a context.
in this paper, we focus on the computational aspect in the design of the distributed algorithm.
there are many interesting extensions to our current work.
the results also suggest that small-world networks are slightly better suited for local task allocation, because there are no nodes with very few neighbors.
furthermore, we showed that it scales well to large networks, both in terms of quality and of required computation time.
on grid networks) and these results held up over a wider range of scenarios.
also other experiments were done (e.g.
the results presented in this paper show that the  distributed algorithm performs well in small-world, scale-free, and random networks, and for many different settings.
finally, we used the optimal solution and the upper-bound (for larger instances) to conduct an  extensive set of experiments to assess the solution quality and the computational efficiency of the proposed distributed  algorithm in different types of networks, namely, small-world networks, random networks, and scale-free networks.
we also introduced an exponential algorithm to compute the optimal solution, as well as a fast  upperbound algorithm.
next, we presented a distributed protocol, related to the  contractnet protocol.
we provided complexity results on computing the efficient solution for the stap, as well as a bound on possible approximation algorithms.
we believe it has a great amount of potential for realistic problems.
in this paper we studied the task allocation problem in a social network (stap), which can be seen as a new, more general, variant of the tap.
