we then proceed to develop a distributed algorithm in section 4, and perform a series of experiments with this algorithm, as described in section 5. section 6 discusses related work, and section 7 concludes. 
in section 3, we prove that the complexity of this problem remains np-hard.
the next section gives a formal description of the task  allocation problem on social networks.
other than modeling the interrelated 500 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas structure between business partners, the social network  introduced in this paper can also be used to represent other types of connections or constraints among autonomous  entities that arise from other application domains.
furthermore, this network is not fully connected: as informed by the business literature, firms typically have established working relations with limited numbers of  preferred partners [10]; these are the ones they consider when new tasks arrive and they have to form supply chains to  allocate those tasks [19].
specifically, therefore, we consider agents to be connected to each other in a social network.
in particular, â€˜the market" cannot be considered as an organizational form without considering specific partners to interact with on the market [11].
in this paper, we study the problem of task allocation from the perspective of such a complex interrelated  structure.
what we are dealing with is a complex interrelated structure.
more recently, tce"s founding father, ronald coase, acknowledged that this is too simplistic an approach [5, p. 245]: the analysis cannot be confined to what  happens within a single firm.
(transaction cost) economics has  traditionally built on analysis of comparative statics: the central problem of economic organization is considered to be the adaptation of organizational forms to the characteristics of transactions.
traditionally, such allocation decisions have been  analyzed using transaction cost economics (tce) [4], which takes the transaction between consecutive stages of  development as its basic unit of analysis, and considers the firm and the market as alternative structural forms for  organizing transactions.
similarly, supply chain formation (scf) is concerned with the, possibly ad-hoc, allocation of services to providers in the supply chain, in such a way that overall profit is optimized [6, 21].
this would be done by allocating them to  different agents who may each be capable of performing different subsets of those tasks.
the question is how vos are to be dynamically composed and re-composed from  individual agents, when different tasks and subtasks need to be performed.
as an example, virtual organizations (vos) are  being re-invented in the context of the grid, where they are composed of a number of autonomous entities (representing different individuals, departments and organizations), each of which has a range of problem-solving capabilities and  resources at its disposal [15, p. 237].
for example, the development of semantic web and grid technologies leads to increased and renewed attention for the potential of the web to support business processes [7, 15].
especially in business  applications, preferential partner selection and interaction is very common, and this aspect becomes more important for task allocation research, to the extent that technological  developments need to be able to support it.
such situations appear very frequently in real-world scenarios, and recent  technological developments are bringing more of them within the range of task allocation methods.
however, some interesting applications where relations between agents play a role  require a slightly more general model.
recent years have seen a lot of work on task and  resource allocation methods, which can potentially be applied to many real-world applications.
