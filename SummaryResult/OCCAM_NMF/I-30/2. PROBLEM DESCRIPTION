given a set of agents a connected by a social network sn = (a, ae), and a finite set of tasks t , the social task allocation problem (or stap for short) is the problem of finding the efficient task allocation φ, such that φ is valid and the social welfare uφ is maximized. 
definition 4 (social task allocation problem).
we are now ready to define the task allocation problem in social network that we study in this paper.
we say a task allocation φ is efficient if it is valid and uφ is  maximized, i.e., uφ = max( p t∈tφ u(t)).
definition 3 (efficient task allocation).
using this notation, we define the efficient task allocation below.
we write tφ to represent the tasks that are fully allocated in φ. the utility of φ is then the summation of the utilities of each task in tφ, i.e., uφ = p t∈tφ u(t).
each such agent that can contribute to a task is called a contractor.
each task t ∈ t can only be allocated to agents that are (direct) neighbors of agent loc(t) in the social network sn.
• a task allocation must obey the social relationships.
φ(t, ·, ·) = 0.
for each r ∈ r, p a∈a φ(t, a, r) ≥ rsc(t, r), or t is not allocated, i.e.
for each task t ∈ t , either all allocated agents" resources are sufficient, i.e.
• a task allocation must be complete.
for each r ∈ r, p t∈t φ(t, a, r) ≤ rsc(a, r).
each agent a ∈ a cannot use more than its available resources, i.e.
, am} in a social network sn, a task allocation is a mapping φ : t × a × r → n. a valid task allocation in sn must satisfy the following constrains: • a task allocation must be correct.
, tn} and a set of agents a = {a1, .
given a set of tasks t = {t1, .
definition 2 (task allocation).
the exact assignment of tasks to agents is defined by a task allocation.
each task t ∈ t needs some specific resources from the agents in order to complete the task.
loc(t) = a, is called the manager of this task.
an agent a that is the location of a task t, i.e.
each task t ∈ t is then defined by a tuple u(t), rsc(t), loc(t) , where u(t) is the utility gained if task t is accomplished, and the resource function rsc : t ×r → n specifies the amount of resources required for the accomplishment of task t. furthermore, a location function loc : t → a defines the locations (i.e., agents) at which the tasks arrive in the social network.
, tn} arrives at such an agent social network.
suppose a set of tasks t = {t1, t2, .
an agent social  network sn = (a, ae) is an undirected graph, where vertices a are agents, and each edge (ai, aj) ∈ ae indicates the  existence of a social connection between agents ai and aj.
definition 1 (social network).
, rk} denote the collection of the resource types available to the agents a. each agent a ∈ a controls a fixed amount of  resources for each resource type in r, which is defined by a resource function: rsc : a × r → n. moreover, we assume agents are connected by a social network.
let r = {r1, .
agents need resources to complete tasks.
, am}.
there is a set a of agents: a = {a1, .
we formulate the social task allocation problem in this section.
