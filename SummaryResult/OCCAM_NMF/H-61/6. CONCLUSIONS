these are first time results that indicate that high quality content-targeted advertising is feasible and practical. 
these were  generated by expanding the web page with new terms (obtained using a sample web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).
for our five impedance coupling strategies, the results  indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the aak strategy) are possible.
this was obtained by a  strategy called aak (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.
for the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.
using a sample of a real case database with over 93  thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.
because of that they are called impedance coupling  strategies.
the other five  strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the web pages and the ads with new terms.
because of that, they are called matching strategies.
five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the web page.
in this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for  associating ads with a web page that is browsed  (contenttargeted advertising).
