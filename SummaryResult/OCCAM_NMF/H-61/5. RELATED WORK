by doing this, we emphasize the main topics of the triggering pages, increasing the possibility of associating relevant ads with them. 
we expand triggering pages with terms extracted from the web collection and then we match these expanded pages to the ads from the advertisement collection.
in our case, we use two collections: an advertisement and a web collection.
they expand user queries applied to a document collection with terms extracted from the top k documents returned as  answer to the query in the same collection.
such method resembles our expansion approach presented in section 3. our method is different from that presented by [4].
finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search  engine results in a trec collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on knn [17].
instead of dealing with  keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.
as mentioned before, the  ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.
the authors conclude that google"s strategy is better than that used by overture.
in  particular, google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its  relevance.
both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list  according to the advertisers" willingness to pay.
in [5] the authors provide a comparison between the  ranking strategies used by google and overture for their keyword advertising systems.
in spite of having the opportunity to use the page"s content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and user"s private information collected along the time.
on the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the user"s browser  allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.
it relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the url of the page requested by the user.
contrary to our work, adwiz does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.
for instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called adwiz that is able to adapt online  advertisement to a user"s short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.
therefore it is not surprising that other works have  addressed the relevance issue.
the results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.
thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that  advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.
for example, in [14] it was shown that  advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.
several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.
