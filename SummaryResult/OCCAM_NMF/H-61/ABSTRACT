they suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms.
these are first  results.
further, a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy, which expands the text of the web page to reduce  vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement, can yield extra gains in average precision of 50%.
our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem (referred to as aak for ads and keywords) can yield gains in average precision figures of 60% compared to a trivial vector-based strategy.
using no other information and  operating in fully automatic fashion, we propose ten strategies for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness.
we assume that we have access to the text of the web page, the keywords declared by an advertiser, and a text associated with the advertiser"s business.
in this work, we study the problem of associating ads with a web page, referred to as content-targeted  advertising, from a computer science perspective.
while search-based  advertising is dominant, the association of ads with a web page (during user navigation) is becoming increasingly  important.
the current boom of the web is associated with the revenues originated from on-line advertising.
