we describe related work in section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in section 4, and the findings of this analysis in section 5. in section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in section 7. 
a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users" interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.
through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.
(iii) is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?
(ii) is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors?
we are interested in answering three research questions: (i) is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search?
using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.
studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.
we hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].
in this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.
since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.
however, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].
they showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in web search.
de lima and pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on web search queries.
there is generally an implied boolean and operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.
typical queries submitted to web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.
however, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.
[18][34]).
research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g.
ir research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.
these techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.
commercial web search engines such as google, yahoo!, and windows live search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.
the formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to information retrieval (ir) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].
