finally, we are designing a set of more complex combinations of these metrics in order to provide enhanced adaptivity to our algorithms. 
we are also analyzing other types of approaches to identify query expansion suggestions, such as applying latent  semantic analysis on the desktop data.
we are currently performing investigations on the dependency between various query features and the optimal number of  expansion terms.
• within a separate set of experiments, we showed our adaptive algorithms to provide an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best approach.
• we moved this personalized search framework further and proposed to make the expansion process adaptive to features of each query, a strong focus being put on its clarity level.
we showed some of these approaches to perform very well,  producing ndcg improvements of up to 51.28%.
• we provided a thorough empirical analysis of several  variants of our approaches, under four different scenarios.
figure 1: relative ndcg gain (in %) for each algorithm  overall, as well as separated per query category.
each of them produces  additional query keywords by analyzing user"s desktop at  increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and expression level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics and  external thesauri.
in this context, the paper includes the following contributions: • we proposed five techniques for determining expansion terms from personal documents.
in this paper we proposed to expand web search queries by  exploiting the user"s personal information repository in order to  automatically extract additional keywords related both to the query itself and to user"s interests, personalizing the search output.
