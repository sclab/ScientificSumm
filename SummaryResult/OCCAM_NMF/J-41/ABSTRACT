we show that there typically exists a multitude of equilibria with second pricing, and we bound the divergence of (economic) value in such equilibria from the value obtained assuming all merchants bid truthfully.
with complete information, we find that no equilibrium exists with first pricing using either rbb or rbr.
we also show that no revenue ranking of rbb and rbr is possible given an arbitrary distribution over bidder values and relevance.
we find that the informational requirements of rbb are much weaker than those of rbr, but that rbr is efficient whereas rbb is not.
with incomplete information, neither rbb nor rbr are truthful with either first or second pricing.
we consider both the short-run  incomplete information setting and the long-run complete  information setting.
we also consider first- and second-price payment rules  together with each of these allocation rules, as both have been used historically.
and google, respectively.
in this paper we analyze the  incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of two slot  auction designs: rank by bid (rbb) and rank by revenue (rbr), which correspond to stylized versions of the  mechanisms currently used by yahoo!
slots for ad listings are  allocated via an auction-style mechanism where the higher a merchant bids, the more likely his ad is to appear above other ads on the page.
billions of dollars are spent each year on sponsored search, a form of advertising where merchants pay for placement alongside web search results.
