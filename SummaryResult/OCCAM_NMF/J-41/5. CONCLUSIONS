in general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case of rbr is the efficient value). 
we showed that no pure-strategy equilibrium exists with either rbb or rbr using first pricing, but that with second pricing there always exists such an equilibrium (in the case of rbr, an efficient equilibrium).
we argued that a stable set of bids in this setting can be modeled as a pure-strategy nash equilibrium of the static game of complete information.
we also studied the long-run case where agents have experimented with their bids and each settled on one they find optimal.
we hope that the tools we used to establish these results (revenue equivalence, the form of first-price equilibria, the truthful payments rules) will help others wanting to pursue further analyses of slot auctions.
we showed that for an arbitrary distribution over value and relevance, no revenue ranking of rbb and rbr is possible.
however, rbr leads to an efficient allocation in equilibrium, whereas rbb does not.
our  equilibrium analysis revealed that rbb has much weaker  informational requirements than rbr, because bidders need not know any information about relevance (even their own) to play the bayes-nash equilibrium.
we first studied the short-run setting with incomplete information, corresponding to the case where agents have just approached the mechanism.
we also considered first and second pricing rules together with each of these allocation rules, since both have been used historically.
and google, namely rank by bid (rbb) and rank by revenue (rbr), respectively.
