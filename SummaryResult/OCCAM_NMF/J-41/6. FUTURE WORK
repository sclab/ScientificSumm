i would also like to thank david parkes for helpful comments. 
acknowledgements david pennock provided valuable guidance throughout this project.
results with risk-averse  bidders, an endogenous number of bidders, asymmetries, etc...) automatically generalize and which do not, to fully  understand the structural differences between single-item and slot auctions.
because the incomplete information case is such a close generalization of the most basic single-item auction model, it would be interesting to see which standard results from single-item auction theory (e.g.
placing bounds on the revenue obtained in a complete information equilibrium is also a relevant question.
identifying a condition on the distribution over value and relevance that actually does yield a revenue ranking of rbb and rbr (such as correlation between value and relevance, perhaps) would yield a more satisfactory characterization of their relative revenue properties.
the problem is then to ascertain that bids and budgets can indeed be optimized separately, or to find a plausible model where deriving equilibrium bids and budgets together is tractable.
assuming that the optimal choice of budget can be made independent of the choice of bid for a specific keyword, it can be shown that it is a dominant-strategy to report this optimal budget with one"s bid.
the complication here lies in the fact that budgets are often set for entire campaigns rather than single keywords.
introducing budget constraints into the model is a  natural next step for future work.
