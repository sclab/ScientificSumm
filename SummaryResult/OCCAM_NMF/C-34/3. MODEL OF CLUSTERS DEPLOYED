but there exist much less nodes in a cluster neighboring to the cluster of a, which can be communicated directly with a. since the two clusters are not deployed at the same time. 
from figure.1, it is easy to know that, for a given node a, there exist lots of nodes in the same cluster of a, which can be communicated directly with a, since the nodes are deployed densely in a cluster.
figure.1 an actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks.
supposing that the sensors form a connected graph in any cluster after deployment through airplanes, and then the fig.1 presents an actual model of clusters deployed sensor networks.
we assign a unique cluster number l (1 ≤ l ≤ k) for each cluster.
supposing that the deployment rounds of sensors are k, and the communication radius of any sensors is r, then the sensors deployed in the same round can be regarded as belonging to a same cluster.
sensor networks in some actual applications of sensor networks, sensors can be deployed through airplanes.
