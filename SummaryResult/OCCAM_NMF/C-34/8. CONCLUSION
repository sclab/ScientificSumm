theoretical and experimental analyses show that the newly proposed algorithm is an efficient pairwise key establishment algorithm that is suitable for the cluster deployed sensor networks. 
so, the traditional pairwise key predistribution algorithm based on hypercube model [7] is only a special case of the new algorithm proposed in this paper.
the new algorithm uses the good characteristics of node codes and high fault-tolerance of h(k,u,m,v,n) model to route and predistribute pairwise keys, in which nodes are not needed to be able to communicate with each other directly such as that the algorithms proposed by [7] shall need.
and based on the h(k,u,m,v,n) model, an innovative pairwise key predistribution scheme and algorithm are designed respectively, by combing the good properties of the polynomial key and key pool encryption schemes.
a new hierarchical hypercube model named h(k,u,m,v,n) is proposed, which can be used for pairwise key predistribution for cluster deployed sensor networks.
