theoretic analysis and experimental figures show that the new algorithm has better performance and provides higher possibilities for sensor to establish pairwise key, compared with previous related works.
furthermore, the working performance of the newly proposed pairwise key establishment algorithm is seriously inspected.
by utilizing nice properties of h(k,u,m,v,n) model, a new general framework for pairwise key predistribution and a new pairwise key establishment algorithm are designed, which combines the idea of kdc(key distribution center) and polynomial pool schemes.
a new kind of cluster deployed sensor networks distribution model is presented, and based on which, an innovative hierarchical hypercube model - h(k,u,m,v,n) and the mapping relationship between cluster deployed sensor networks and the h(k,u,m,v,n) are proposed.
security schemes of pairwise key establishment, which enable sensors to communicate with each other securely, play a fundamental role in research on security issue in wireless sensor networks.
