definition 4 (n-dimensional hypercube): an n-dimensional hypercube (or n−cube) h(v,n) is a topology with the following properties: (1) it is consisted of n·vn-1 edges, (2) each node can be coded as a string with n positions such as b1b2…bn, where 0≤b1,b2,…,bn≤v-1, (3) any two nodes are called neighbors, which means that there is an edge between them, iff there is just one position different between their node codes. 
definition 3 (key path): for any two nodes a0 and ak, when there has not a pairwise key between them, if there exists a path a0,a1,a2,……,ak-1,ak, and there exists at least one pairwise key between the nodes ai and aj for 0≤i≤k-1 and 1≤j≤k, then the path consisted of a0,a1,a2,……,ak-1,ak is called a key path between a0 and ak.
definition 2 (pairwise key): for any two nodes a and b, if they have a common key e, then the key e is called a pairwise key between them.
definition 1 (key predistribution): the procedure, which is used to encode the corresponding encryption and decryption algorithms in sensor nodes before distribution, is called key predistribution.
