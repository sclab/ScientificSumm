the combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is  intended to endow mas designers with the ability to  incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 
corresponding to families of normative structures that are susceptible to tractable  offline conflict detection.
on the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis  techniques of cpns in order to characterise classes of cpns (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.)
[2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting  different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).
furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of cholvy and cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by carabelea et al.
we expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more  flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.
as a first step in this direction we are  taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction  protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).
we should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a  generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic  content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated mas.
these three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.
the algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage  normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Î´ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.
the approach to conflict detection and resolution is an  adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs  reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].
his idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.
sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.
finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.
to our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated mas has not been reported elsewhere.
[20] map conversation schemata to cpns.
lin et al.
in [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of cpns and thereafter translated into protocols.
the idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via petri nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as cpn sub-nets that are subsequently  combined for analysis.
that similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative  structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.

the normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 the sixth intl.
the notion is fruitful because it allows the  separation of normative and procedural concerns.
the second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.
when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.
this is a serious  disadvantage, e.g.
since these  interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.
however, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.
in [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in mas.
to our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.
firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.
our contributions in this paper are three-fold.
