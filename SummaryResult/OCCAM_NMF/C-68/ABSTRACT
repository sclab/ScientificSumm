two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency  improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.
these improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes.
significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead.
using  analysis and extensive simulations, we gain novel insights into the  design of carrier-based systems.
in this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.
our target environment uses data carriers, termed zebroids, where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf of a server to a client thereby minimizing its availability latency.
on-demand delivery of audio and video clips in peer-to-peer  vehicular ad-hoc networks is an emerging area of research.
