hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = t i=1 δi · fi next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected. 
we are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.
however, in most practical circumstances γ may not be so large as to find every data item.
note that since there is at least one replica in the system for every data item i, by setting γ to a large value we ensure that the client"s request for any data item i will be satisfied.
if this condition is not satisfied, then we set δi to γ. this indicates that data item i was not available to the client during its journey.
the availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client automata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.
in this case, a request for the lost data item may need to be satisfied by fetching the item from a remote server.
in cases where a data item may be lost from the ad-hoc network, this equation becomes ri = min (n, max (0, ri·n·α si )).
this captures the case when at least one copy of every data item must be present in the ad-hoc network at all times.
ri is normalized to a value between 0 and 1. the number of replicas for data item i, denoted as ri, is: ri = min (n, max (1, ri·n·α si )).
the frequency of access to data item i is denoted as fi, with t j=1 fj = 1. let the trip duration of the client automata under consideration be γ. we now define the normalized frequency of access to the data item i, denoted by ri, as: ri = (fi)n t j=1(fj)n ; 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞ (1) the exponent n characterizes a particular replication technique.
a square-root replication scheme is realized when n = 0.5 [5].
this serves as the base-line for comparison with the case when  zebroids are deployed.
