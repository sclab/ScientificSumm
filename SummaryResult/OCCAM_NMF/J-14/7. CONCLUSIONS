furthermore, a 2-player,  3action example from [1] also has infinite mediation value. 
it is known from [1] that the mediation value of 2-player, 2-action games with non-negative payoffs is at most 4 3 , and they exhibit a 3-player game for which it is infinite.
the ratio between these values is called the mediation value in [1].
alternatively it may be interesting to look for similar results in the context of correlated equilibria (ce), especially since the best ce may have higher value (total expected payoff) than the best ne.
then checking if there is a nash equilibrium in which none of the players assigns a  nonzero probability to his third action is equivalent to checking if there exists a nash equilibrium that satisfies the payoff bounds in the original game, and section 5.1 shows that finding an exact solution to this problem requires new ideas.
namely, given a two-action game with payoff bounds, consider a game in which each player vi has a third action that guarantees him a payoff of ti no matter what everyone else does.
in particular, note that one can view the bounded payoff games as a very limited special case of games with three actions per player.
however, it seems that this will make the analysis significantly more difficult.
it is natural to ask if our results or those of [9] can be generalized to games with three or more actions.
at the moment however, it is perhaps more important to  inves170 tigate whether nash equilibria of graphical games can be computed in a decentralized manner, in contrast to the algorithms we have  introduced here.
further work in this vein could include extensions to the kinds of guarantees sought for nash equilibria, such as guaranteeing total payoffs for subsets of players, selecting equilibria in which some players are receiving significantly higher payoffs than their peers, etc.
in the full version of the paper we describe our algorithms for the general case.
while we prove our results for games on a path, they can be generalized to any tree for which the best response policies have compact representations as unions of rectangles.
this is the strongest  positive result one can derive for a problem whose exact solutions may be hard to represent, as is the case for many of the problems  considered here.
under mild restrictions on the inputs, they can be modified to be truly polynomial.
our algorithms are fully polynomial time approximation schemes, i.e., their running time is polynomial in the inverse of the  approximation parameter , though they may be pseudopolynomial with respect to the input size.
as argued in the introduction, there are several reasons to prefer a solution that constitutes an exact nash equilibrium.
our approach is different in that we insist on outputting an exact nash equilibrium, which is -close to  satisfying a given requirement.
while the problem of finding approximate nash equilibria for various classes of games has  received a lot of attention in recent years, most of the existing work aims to find -nash equilibria that satisfy (or are -close to  satisfying) certain properties.
we then provided approximation algorithms for selecting nash equilibria with special properties.
this is in sharp contrast with the fact that graphical games on trees always possess a nash equilibrium in which all players" strategies are rational numbers.
namely, we showed that even for graphical games on paths, any algebraic number α ∈ [0, 1] may be the only strategy available to some player in all social  welfaremaximizing nash equilibria.
first, we focused on the algebraic complexity of a  social welfare-maximizing nash equilibrium, and proved strong  negative results for that problem.
we considered several criteria for selecting a nash equilibrium, such as maximizing the social welfare, ensuring a lower bound on the expected payoff of each player, etc.
we have studied the problem of equilibrium selection in  graphical games on bounded-degree trees.
