these two algorithms can be combined to produce nash equilibria that satisfy various fairness criteria.
we show that, while exactly computing the latter is infeasible (we prove that  solving this problem may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily high degree), there exists an fptas for finding such an equilibrium as long as the best response policy has polynomial size.
another attractive solution concept is a nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare.
in this paper, we show that if the underlying graph is a bounded-degree tree and the best response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient  algorithm which constructs a nash equilibrium that guarantees certain payoffs to all participants.
in [9], it was shown that the best response policy has polynomial size as long as the underlying graph is a path.
[13] as a way to represent all nash equilibria of a graphical game.
our approach is based on the data structure called the best response policy, which was proposed by kearns et al.
this paper addresses the problem of fair equilibrium selection in graphical games.
