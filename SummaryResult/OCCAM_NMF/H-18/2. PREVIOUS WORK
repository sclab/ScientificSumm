some of those methods have been extended into the area of topic segmentation, such as plsa [5] and maximum entropy [7], but to our best knowledge, using mi for topic segmentation has not been studied. 
criteria of these approaches can be utilized in the  issue of topic segmentation.
topical classification or clustering is an important direction in this area, especially co-clustering of documents and terms, such as lsa [9], plsa [13], and approaches based on distances and bipartite graph  partitioning [28] or maximum mi [2, 10], or maximum entropy [1, 18].
text classification and clustering is a related research area which categorizes documents into groups using supervised or unsupervised methods.
previous research studied methods to find shared topics [16] and topic segmentation and summarization between just a pair of documents [14].
there are not many works in the latter category, even though the performance of  segmentation is expected to be better with utilization of  information from multiple documents.
while some existing methods only consider information in single documents [6, 15], others  utilize multiple documents [16, 14].
some approaches also focus on cue words as hints of topic transitions [11].
some models consider dependence  between sentences and sections, such as hidden markov model [3, 27], maximum entropy markov model [19], and  conditional random fields [17], while many other approaches are based on lexical cohesion or similarity of sentences [5, 6, 15, 25, 21].
however, often  getting large training sets with manual labels on document sentences is prohibitively expensive, so unsupervised  approaches are desired.
supervised learning usually has good performance, since it learns functions from labelled training sets.
generally, the existing approaches to text segmentation fall into two categories: supervised learning [19, 17, 23] and unsupervised learning [3, 27, 5, 6, 15, 25, 21].
