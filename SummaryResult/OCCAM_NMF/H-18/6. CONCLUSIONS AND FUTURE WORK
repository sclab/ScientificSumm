supervised learning also can be considered. 
moreover,  natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be used to find the optimal boundaries.
more previous methods should be compared with.
more data sets especially complicated ones should be tested.
we only tested our method on limited data sets.
our results also illustrated that  using weighted mutual information can utilize the information of multiple documents to reach a better performance.
moreover, we also showed that doing  segmentation among multiple documents can improve the  performance tremendously.
our approach outperforms all the previous methods on  singledocument cases.
we used dynamic programming to optimize our algorithm.
we proposed a novel method for multi-document topic segmentation and alignment based on weighted mutual  information, which can also handle single-document cases.
