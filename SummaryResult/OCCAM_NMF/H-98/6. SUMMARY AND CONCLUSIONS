thanks also to jaime carbonell and john lafferty for their useful feedback on the final versions of this paper. 
also, we  sincerely thank chris meek and john platt for the very useful advice provided in the early stages of this work.
acknowledgments we are grateful to francisco pereira for the sign test code, anton likhodedov for logistic regression code, and john platt for the code support for the linear svm classifier toolkit smox.
given the ease of  estimating the parameters of this distribution, it is a good first choice for producing quality probability estimates.
in striking contrast, the asymmetric laplace distribution appears to be preferable over several large text domains and a variety of  performance measures to the primary competing parametric methods, though comparable performance is sometimes achieved with one of two varieties of logistic regression.
while these distributions attempt to strike a balance between the generalization power of parametric distributions and the flexibility that the added asymmetric parameters give, the asymmetric  gaussian appears to have too great of an emphasis away from the modes.
we have given an efficient way to estimate the parameters of these distributions.
in addition, we have introduced two new families that attempt to capitalize on the asymmetric behavior that tends to arise from learning a discrimination function.
we have reviewed a wide variety of parametric methods for  producing probability estimates from the raw scores of a discriminative classifier and for recalibrating an uncalibrated probabilistic  classifier.
