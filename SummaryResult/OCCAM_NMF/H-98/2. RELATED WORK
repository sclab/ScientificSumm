al [19] first proposed the idea of recalibrating classifiers, and degroot & fienberg [5, 6] gave the now accepted standard formalization for the problem of assessing calibration initiated by others [4, 24].

recalibrating poorly calibrated classifiers is not a new problem.
finally, bennett [1] obtained moderate gains by applying platt"s method to the recalibration of na¨ıve bayes but found there were more problematic areas than when it was applied to svms.
his work showed that this post-processing method not only can produce probability estimates of similar quality to svms directly trained to produce probabilities (regularized likelihood kernel  methods), but it also tends to produce sparser kernels (which generalize better).
platt [22] uses a logistic regression framework that models noisy class labels to produce probabilities from the raw output of an svm.
there is a variety of other work that this paper extends.
in addition, their methods reduce the resolution of the scores output by the classifier (the number of distinct values output), but the methods here do not have such a weakness since they are continuous functions.
our work provides asymmetric parametric methods which complement the non-parametric and semi-parametric  methods they propose when data scarcity is an issue.
while they compared their methods to other  parametric methods based on symmetry, they fail to provide significance test results.
in more recent work [27], they investigate using a semi-parametric method that uses a monotonic  piecewiseconstant fit to the data and apply the method to na¨ıve bayes and a linear svm.
zadrozny & elkan [26] provide a corrective measure for decision trees (termed curtailment) and a non-parametric method for  recalibrating na¨ıve bayes.
focus on improving probability estimates has been growing lately.
our work is similar in flavor to these previous attempts to model search engine scores, but we target text classifier outputs which we have found demonstrate a different type of score distribution  behavior because of the role of training data.
they also survey the long history of modeling the relevance scores of search engines.
they use a different parametric distribution for the relevant and irrelevant classes, but do not pursue two-sided asymmetric  distributions for a single class as described here.
al [20] introduced models appropriate to produce probability estimates from relevance scores returned from search engines and demonstrated how the resulting probability estimates could be  subsequently employed to combine the outputs of several search  engines.

lewis & gale [17] use logistic regression to recalibrate na¨ıve bayes though the quality of the probability estimates are not directly evaluated; it is simply performed as an intermediate step in active learning.
parametric models have been employed to obtain probability  estimates in several areas of information retrieval.
