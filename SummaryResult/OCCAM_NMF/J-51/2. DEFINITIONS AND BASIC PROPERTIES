we are now ready to move on to the core of this paper. 
more detailed discussions and examples can be found in standard texts on microeconomics or game theory [17, 5].
thus, removing the mixed strategy σj does not introduce any new dominances.
if σi gives player i a higher utility than σi against mixed strategy σj for player j = i (and strategies σ−{i,j} for the other players), then for at least one pure strategy σj that σj places positive  probability on, σi must perform better than σi against σj (and strategies σ−{i,j} for the other players).
we note that the process of iterated dominance is never helped by removing a dominated mixed strategy, for the following reason.
l r u 1, 1 0, 0 d 0, 1 1, 0 either strict or weak dominance can be used in the  definition of iterated dominance.
for  example, in the following game, r can be removed first, after which d is dominated.
σr may originally not dominate σr because the latter performs better against σc; but then, once σc is removed because it is dominated by σc, σr dominates σr, and the latter can be removed.
iterated dominance can eliminate more strategies than dominance, as follows.
when we are looking at the dominance relations for player i, the other players (−i) can be thought of as a single player.3  therefore, in the rest of the paper, when we study one-shot (not iterated) dominance, we will focus without loss of generality on two-player games.4 in two-player games, we will  generally refer to the players as r (row) and c (column) rather than 1 and 2. in iterated dominance, dominated strategies are removed from the game, and no longer have any effect on future  dominance relations.
the definition are the expected utilities.2 there are other  notions of dominance, such as very weak dominance (in which no strict inequality is required, so two strategies can  dominate each other), but we will not study them here.
for example, simple dominance checks are sometimes used as a subroutine in searching for nash equilibria [21].
in this case, the utilities in dominance altogether.
in this definition, it is sometimes allowed for the  dominating strategy σi to be a mixed strategy, that is, a probability distribution over pure strategies.
player i"s strategy σi is said to be weakly dominated by player i"s strategy σi if for any vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) ≥ ui(σi, σ−i), and for at least one vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) > ui(σi, σ−i).
definition 2. player i"s strategy σi is said to be strictly dominated by player i"s strategy σi if for any vector of  strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) > ui(σi, σ−i).
the two main notions of dominance are defined as follows.
, σn) denotes player i"s utility when each player j plays action σj).

definition 1. a normal form game is given by a set of players {1, 2, .
an n-player normal form game is defined as follows.
in this section, we briefly review normal form games, as well as dominance and iterated dominance (both strict and weak).
