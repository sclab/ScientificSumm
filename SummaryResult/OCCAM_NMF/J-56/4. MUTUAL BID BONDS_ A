using mutual bid bonds thus increases reparability and allows a robust solution of revenue 200 as opposed to 190, as was previously the case. 
recall, that previously this was not the case.
therefore, 1, 1, 0 may be considered a robust solution.
the repair solutions for bids 1 and 2 can be extended further by assigning bid3 to 1 (branches 9.2 and 9.4).
figure 2: repair search tree for breaks 1 and 2, κ = 0.05. and is just within the limit given by β. in figure 1(a) the search path follows the dashed line and sets bid3 to be 0 (branch 9).

0, 0, 1 is a solution that has already been found so the search for a repair in this example is not strictly necessary but is described for pedagogical reasons.
when we extend the partial repair for bid1 so that bid2 loses an item (branch 8.1), the overall cost of repair increases to 5, due to this item withdrawal by the bid-taker, 3 the actual implementation of wss search checks previous  solutions to see if they can repair breaks before searching for a new repair solution.
β may also be viewed as the size of the fund available to facilitate backtracking by the bid-taker.
we therefore set β to 5 and this becomes the maximum expenditure allowed to withdraw items from winning bidders.
when bid1 breaks, there is a compensation penalty paid to the bid-taker equal to 5 that can be used to fund a reassignment of the items.
the search for repair solutions for breaks to bid1 and bid2 appear in figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively3 .
if a bid is withdrawn, the bidder forfeits this amount and the bid-taker can then compensate winning bidders whose items are withdrawn when trying to form a repair solution later.
example 2. consider the example given in table 1 once more, where the bids also comprise a mutual bid bond of 5% of the bid amount.
the penalties paid are used to fund a reassignment of items to form a repair solution of sufficient revenue by  compensating previously successful bidders for withdrawal of the items from them.
high values of κ tend towards full-commitment and reduce the advantages of such winner"s curse & bid-taker"s exposure  insurance.
increased levels of bid withdrawal are likely when the penalties are low also.
andersson and sandholm [1] found that myopic agents reach a higher social welfare quicker if they act selfishly rather than cooperatively when penalties in leveled commitment contracts are low.
low values of κ incur low bid withdrawal penalties and simulate a dictatorial bid-taker who does not adequately compensate bidders for item withdrawal.
it merely influences the levels of penalties and compensation transacted by agents.
if the decommitment penalties are the same for both parties in all bids, κ does not influence the reparability of a given set of bids.
bid amount [14, 18].
on the other hand it decreases the reparability of solutions.
the probability of such a bid being withdrawn may be less, so a  repair solution may be deemed unnecessary for this bid.
if a bidder does not agree to the insurance, it may be  inferred that he may have accurately determined the valuation for the items and therefore less likely to fall victim to the winner"s curse.
in practice a bid bond typically ranges between 5 and 20% of the 2 making the insurance optional may be beneficial in some  instances.
showed that this can increase the expected payoffs of all parties and enables deals that would be impossible under full commitment [26, 28, 29].
sandholm et al.
such contracts permit unilateral decommitment for  prespecified penalties.
mutual bid bonds may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract in which both parties may break the contract for the same fixed penalty.
usually they are mandatory for all bids, are a fixed percentage, κ, of the bid amount and are unidirectional in that item withdrawal by the bid-taker is not permitted.
bid bonds are commonplace in procurement for construction projects.
this information is essential for bidders when determining how aggressive they should be in their bidding strategy.
we also contend that it is imperative that the bidder knows the potential penalty for  withdrawal in advance of bid submission.
combinatorial auctions impose a heavy computational burden on the bidder so it is important that the hedging of risk should be a simple and transparent operation for the bidder so as not to  further increase this burden unnecessarily.
in the interests of fairness, compensation is paid to bidders from whom items are withdrawn and is equivalent to the penalty that would have been imposed on the bidder should he have withdrawn the bid.
the conditions attached to the bid bonds are that the bid-taker be allowed to annul winning bids (item withdrawal) when repairing breaks elsewhere in the solution.
such mutual bid bonds are mandatory for each bid in our model2 .
we propose that such winner"s curse & bid-taker"s exposure insurance comprise a fixed percentage, κ, of the bid amount for all bids.

in this section we propose an auction model that permits bid and item withdrawal by the bidders and bid-taker, respectively.
if we can alter the rules of an auction so that the bid-taker can retract items from winning  bidders, then the reparability of solutions to such auctions may be  improved.
backtracking mechanism some auction solutions are inherently brittle and it may be  impossible to find a robust solution.
