categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval]: information search and retrieval general terms algorithms 
the value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high performance of our system, which received the highest overall ranking for us english speech data in the recent nist spoken term detection evaluation [1].
the transcripts are indexed for query  processing and ranking purpose.
a speech recognizer generates word confusion networks and phonetic lattices.
we present a vocabulary independent system that can  handle arbitrary queries, exploiting the information provided by having both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts.
such phonetic transcripts suffer from lower  accuracy and cannot be an alternative to word transcripts.
in addition to the output word transcript, advanced systems provide also phonetic transcripts, against which query terms can be matched  phonetically.
however, query terms that are not part of the recognizer"s vocabulary cannot be retrieved, and the recall of the search is affected.
today, most systems use large vocabulary  continuous speech recognition tools to produce word transcripts; the transcripts are indexed and query terms are retrieved from the index.
we are interested in retrieving information from speech data like broadcast news, telephone conversations and roundtable meetings.
