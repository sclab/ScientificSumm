we show that this worst-case bound is tight within a factor of two by illustrating a situation in which a threshold security requires n/2 rounds to converge. 
we show that, for all prior  distributions, the price of a threshold security converges to its rational expectations equilibrium price in at most n rounds, where n is the number of bits of distributed information.
we also  provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence time for these threshold securities.
boolean securities with more complex payoffs may not converge under some prior distributions.
we prove that only boolean securities whose payoffs can be expressed as  threshold functions of the distributed input bits of information are guaranteed to converge as predicted by rational expectations theory.
in section 4, we present our main  theoretical results concerning this model.
to do so, in section 3, we propose a model of an  information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and, we believe, captures much of the important essence of real information markets.
in this paper, we investigate the nature of the  computational process whereby distributed information is revealed and combined over time into the prices in information  markets.
the iowa electronic  market1 is a prime example, operated by the university of iowa tippie college of business for the purpose of investigating how information about political elections distributed among traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8].
while most markets are not designed with information  aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives 156 markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating  information on a topic of interest.
all information available to all traders is now reflected in the going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some new information becomes available.
at this point, the market is in what is called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19].
over time, if the process works as advertised, all information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same information state.
traders learn or infer what information others are likely to have by observing prices, then update their own beliefs based on their  observations.
as trades are made, summary  information is revealed through market prices.
each trader begins with his or her own information.
the process of information incorporation is, at its essence, a distributed computation.
supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8, 22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets [30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of experimental markets [6, 25, 26].
as a result, market prices  encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all  information, even if that information is distributed across many sources.
the strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all  information available to all traders.
