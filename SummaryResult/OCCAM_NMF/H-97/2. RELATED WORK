in this work, we do not focus on peer relationships; however, such methods could  complement those here since peer relationships often influence word choice when requesting an action. 
[7] presented  methods for learning social networks from e-mail.
for example, in a forum dedicated to e-mail learning tasks, culotta et al.
interest in a variety of learning tasks related to e-mail has been rapidly growing in the recent literature.
in this study, we examine several alternative  classification methods, compare document-level and sentence-level  approaches and analyze the machine learning issues implicit in these problems.
instead, they simply apply a standard svm at the sentence-level and focus primarily on a linguistic analysis of how the sentence can be logically reformulated before adding it to the task list.
additionally, they do not study alternative choices or approaches to the classification task.
from a learning perspective, while they make use of judgments at the sentence-level, they do not  explicitly compare what if any benefits finer-grained judgments offer.
we include questions, but note that not all questions are action-items - some are rhetorical or simply social convention, how are you?.
this classification task is very similar to ours except they do not consider simple factual questions to  belong to this category.
[6] consider detecting items in e-mail to put on a to-do list.
corston-oliver et al.
in contrast, we consider whether accuracy can be increased by using finer-grained human judgments that mark the specific sentences and phrases of interest.
while they provide results for  several classification methods, their methods only make use of human judgments at the document-level.
we consider action-items to be an important specific type of speech act that falls within their more general classification.
[5] describe an ontology of speech acts, such as propose a meeting, and attempt to predict when an e-mail contains one of these speech acts.
cohen et al.
several other researchers have considered very similar text  classification tasks.
