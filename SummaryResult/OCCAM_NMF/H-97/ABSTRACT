however, using enriched feature sets, such as n-grams (up to n=4) with chi-squared feature selection, and contextual cues for action-item location improve performance by up to 10% over unigrams, using in both cases state of the art classifiers such as svms with  automated model selection via embedded cross-validation.
unlike standard topic-driven text classification, action-item detection requires inferring the sender"s intent, and as such responds less well to pure bag-of-words classification.
whereas information retrieval and machine learning techniques are gaining initial acceptance in spam filtering and automated folder assignment, this paper reports on a new task: automated action-item detection, in order to flag emails that require responses, and to highlight the specific passage(s) indicating the  request(s) for action.
e-mail users face an ever-growing challenge in managing their  inboxes due to the growing centrality of email in the workplace for task assignment, action requests, and other roles beyond  information dissemination.
