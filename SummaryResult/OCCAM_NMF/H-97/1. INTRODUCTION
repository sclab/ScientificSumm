finally, we summarize this paper"s contributions and consider interesting directions for future work. 
we then conduct an empirical analysis that helps us determine the effectiveness of our feature extraction procedures as well as establish baselines for a number of  classification algorithms on this task.
from there, we move to a discussion of feature  representation and selection techniques appropriate for this problem and how standard text classification approaches can be adapted to smoothly move from the sentence-level detection problem to the  documentlevel classification problem.
then we more formally define the action-item detection problem, discuss the aspects that distinguish it from more common problems like topic classification, and highlight the challenges in  constructing systems that can perform well at the sentence and document level.
we first review related work for similar text classification  problems such as e-mail priority ranking and speech act identification.
we believe that action-item detection is one of the first clear instances of an ir-related task where we must move beyond bag-of-words to achieve high performance, albeit not too far, as bag-of-n-grams seem to suffice.
topic detection and  tracking (tdt), also works well with unigram feature sets [1, 20].
in fact, genre-classification, which one would think may require more than a bag-of-words approach, also works quite well using just unigram features [14].
text categorization by topic, on the other hand, works very well using just individual words as features [2, 9, 13, 17].
instead we find that we need more information-laden features such as higher-order n-grams.
second, action-item detection attempts to recover the email sender"s intent - whether she means to elicit response or action on the part of the receiver; note that for this task, classifiers using only unigrams as features do not perform optimally, as evidenced in our results  below.
in contrast, standard text categorization merely assigns a topic label to each text, whether that label corresponds to an e-mail folder or a controlled indexing vocabulary [12, 15, 22].
first, the user is interested both in  detecting whether an email contains action items and in locating exactly where these action item requests are contained within the email body.
action-item detection differs from standard text classification in two important ways.
the utility of such a detector can manifest as a method of prioritizing e-mails according to task-oriented criteria other than the standard ones of topic and sender or as a means of ensuring that the email user hasn"t dropped the proverbial ball by forgetting to address an action request.
we view action-item detection as one necessary component of a successful e-mail agent which would perform spam detection, action-item  detection, topic classification and priority ranking, among other  functions.
such a detection system can be used as one part of an e-mail agent which would assist a user in processing important e-mails quicker than would have been possible without the agent.
automated action-item detection targets the third of these problems by attempting to detect which e-mails require an action or response with information, and within those e-mails, attempting to highlight the sentence (or other  passage length) that directly indicates the action request.
the receiver"s attention or action.
-henry figure 1: an e-mail with emphasized action-item, an explicit request that requires the recipient"s attention or action.
keep up the good work!
as a result, i will need each of your parts by wednesday.
this includes prioritizing e-mails over a range of sources from business partners to family members, filtering and reducing junk e-mail, and quickly managing requests that demand from: henry hutchins <hhutchins@innovative.company.com> to: sara smith; joe johnson; william woolings subject: meeting with prospective customers sent: fri 12/10/2005 8:08 am hi all, i"d like to remind all of you that the group from grty will be visiting us next friday at 4:30 p.m. the current schedule looks like this: + 9:30 a.m. informal breakfast and discussion in cafeteria + 10:30 a.m. company overview + 11:00 a.m. individual meetings (continue over lunch) + 2:00 p.m. tour of facilities + 3:00 p.m. sales pitch in order to have this go off smoothly, i would like to practice the  presentation well in advance.
e-mail users are facing an increasingly difficult task of  managing their inboxes in the face of mounting challenges that result from rising e-mail usage.
