finally, we gratefully acknowledge scott fahlman for his encouragement and useful discussions on this topic. 
we would also like to thank django wexler for constructing and supporting the corpus labeling tools and curtis huttenhower"s support of the text preprocessing package.
we would like to extend our sincerest thanks to jill lehman whose efforts in data collection were essential in constructing the corpus, and both jill and aaron steinfeld for their direction of the hci experiments.

when finer-grained judgments are available, then a standard bag-of-words approach using a small (sentence) window size and automatic segmentation techniques can produce results  almost as good as the n-gram based approaches.
our empirical analysis has demonstrated that n-grams are of key importance to making the most of  documentlevel judgments.
in this work, we examined how action-items can be effectively detected in e-mails.
this, in turn,  indicates that improved sentence segmentation methods could yield further improvements in classification.
sentence detection that is then agglomerated to document-level detection works surprisingly better given low recall than would be expected with sentence-level items.
further  experiments are needed to see how this interacts with the amount of  training data available.
the effectiveness of sentence-level detection argues that  labeling at the sentence-level provides significant value.
