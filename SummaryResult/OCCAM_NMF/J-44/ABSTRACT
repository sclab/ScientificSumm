we argue that the three rating roles presented here provide broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community.
for instance, they can be used to track the evolution of neighborhoods, to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to system performance, to enumerate users who are in  danger of leaving, and to assess the susceptibility of the system to attacks such as shilling.
these roles find direct uses in  improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of items and, most importantly, in helping monitor the health of the system as a whole.
in particular, we formulate three roles-scouts, promoters, and connectors-that  capture how users receive recommendations, how items get  recommended, and how ratings of these two types are  themselves connected (resp.).
we present a novel study that disaggregates global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles played by ratings in  nearestneighbor collaborative filtering.
the quality of this aggregation process crucially  affects the user experience and hence the effectiveness of  recommenders in e-commerce.
recommender systems aggregate individual user ratings into predictions of products or services that might interest  visitors.
