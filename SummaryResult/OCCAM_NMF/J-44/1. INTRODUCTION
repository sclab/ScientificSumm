in section 5, we illustrate the use of these roles to address the goals outlined above. 
background on nearest-neighbor  collaborative filtering and algorithm evaluation is discussed in  section 2. section 3 defines and discusses the roles of a rating, and section 4 defines measures of the contribution of a  rating in each of these roles.
the rest of the paper is  organized as follows.
as we show, the characterization of rating roles presented here provides broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community.
these include being able to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to system performance, and could be removed; to  enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, or have left the system; and to assess the susceptibility of the  system to attacks such as shilling [5].
tracking the roles of a rating and its evolution over time provides many insights into the health of the system, and how it could be managed and improved.
3. monitoring the evolution of the recommender system and its stakeholders: a recommender system is  constantly under change: growing with new users and 250 items, shrinking with users leaving the system, items becoming irrelevant, and parts of the system under  attack.
identifying users who can be encouraged to rate specific items helps ensure coverage of the recommender system.
2. targeting items: recommender systems suffer from lack of user participation, especially in cold-start  scenarios [13] involving newly arrived items.
identifying ratings responsible for such bad recommendations and suggesting new items to rate can help situate the user in a better neighborhood.
in turn, this capability helps support scenarios such as: 1. situating users in better neighborhoods: a user"s  ratings may inadvertently connect the user to a  neighborhood for which the user"s tastes may not be a perfect match.
viewing ratings in this way, we can define the contribution of a  rating in each role, both in terms of allowing recommendations to occur, and in terms of influence on the quality of  recommendations.
we identify three possible roles: (scouts) to connect the user into the system to receive recommendations, (promoters) to connect an item into the system to be recommended, and (connectors) to connect ratings of these two kinds.
our motivation here is to disaggregate global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each  individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles played by ratings in nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering.
such an understanding will give an important handle to monitoring and managing a recommender system, to engineer  mechanisms to sustain the recommender, and thereby ensure its continued success.
however, with the  exception of a few studies on the influence of users [10], little attention has been paid to unraveling the inner workings of a recommender in terms of the individual ratings and the roles they play in making (good) recommendations.
significant research has been conducted in implementing fast and accurate  collaborative filtering algorithms [2, 7], designing interfaces for presenting recommendations to users [1], and studying the robustness of these algorithms [8].
collaborative filtering, a common form of recommendation, predicts a user"s rating for an item by combining (other) ratings of that user with other users" ratings.
recommender systems have become integral to e-commerce, providing technology that suggests products to a visitor based on previous purchases or rating history.
