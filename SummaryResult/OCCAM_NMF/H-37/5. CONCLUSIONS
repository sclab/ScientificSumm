while our current methods appear robust against primitive attacks along these lines, such as the good word attack [24], we must explore the feasibility of more sophisticated attacks. 
although it is currently true that ham and spam are linearly separable given an appropriate feature space, this assumption may be subject to attack.
finally, we note that the success of relaxed svm methods for content-based spam detection is a result that depends on the nature of spam data, which is potentially subject to change.
future work will determine how applicable relaxed svms are to the general problem of text classification.
it appears that spam data is highly separable, allowing rosvm to be successful with high  values of c and little effort given to maximizing the margin.
maximizing the margin may cause these sparsely represented features to be ignored, creating an overall  reduction in performance.
these indicative features may be sparsely represented in the data set, because of spam methods such as word obfuscation, in which common spam words are intentionally misspelled in an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of word-based spam detection.
we  conjecture that email spam, blog comment spam, and splogs all share the characteristic that a subset of features are  particularly indicative of content being either spam or not spam.
after all, not all data allows the relaxation of svm requirements.
it is natural to ask why the task of content-based spam  detection gets strong performance from rosvm.
these  methods are efficient enough for large-scale filtering of  contentbased spam in its many forms.
thus, we have proposed a less expensive  alternative, rosvm, that relaxes this maximum margin  requirement, and produces nearly equivalent results.
the high values of c required for best performance with svms show that the margin maximization of online svms is overkill for this task.

these results compare online svm and rosvm on splog detection using binary 4-gram feature space.
online svms do, indeed,  protable 7: splog data set.
we have presented one resolution to this debate.
in the past, academic researchers and industrial  practitioners have disagreed on the best method for online  contentbased detection of spam on the web.
