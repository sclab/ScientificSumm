categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval]: information search and retrieval - spam general terms measurement, experimentation, algorithms 
our results are experimentally verified on email spam, blog spam, and splog detection tasks.
second, we show that nearly equivalent performance may be achieved by a relaxed online svm (rosvm) at greatly reduced  computational cost.
first, we show that online svms indeed give state-of-the-art classification performance on online spam filtering on large benchmark data sets.
in this paper, we offer a resolution to this controversy.
additionally, practitioners cite the high cost of svms as reason to prefer faster (if less statistically robust) bayesian methods.
however, similar  performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam filtering.
the former have advocated the use of  support vector machines (svms) for content-based filtering, as this machine learning methodology gives state-of-the-art performance for text classification.
content-based filtering is one reliable method of  combating this threat in its various forms, but some academic researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam.
spam is a key problem in electronic communication,  including large-scale email systems and the growing number of blogs.
