this analysis can be performed for short term (when there is currently a resource failure) or long term (e.g.,  network optimization) considerations. 
impact analysis (bottom-up perspective): in case of a fault in a resource, its influence on the associated  services and affected customers can be determined.
if the fault has been repaired, the affected customers should be informed about this  automatically.
effort reduction (top-down perspective): if several user trouble reports are symptoms of the same fault, fault processing should be performed only once and not several times.
this is  especially needed with respect to slas as such agreements often contain guarantees like a mean time to repair.
to summarize, the reasons for the necessity of a  serviceoriented event correlation are the following: keeping of slas (top-down perspective): the time interval between the first symptom (recognized either by provider, network management tools, or customers) that a service does not perform properly and the  verified fault repair needs to be minimized.
in the resource-oriented perspective it would be possible to define events which indicate that there is a link usage higher than a threshold, but no mechanism has currently been established to find out which services are affected and whether a qos violation occurs.
a degradation in service  quality which is caused by high traffic load on the backbone is another example.
an example of such an aspect is that a fault does not lead to a total failure of a service, but its qos parameters, respectively agreed service levels, at the customer-provider interface might not be met.
it is important to note that the service-oriented  perspective is needed to integrate service aspects, especially qos  aspects.
however, it shows the general principle of identifying the common subservices and common resources of different services.
this is certainly a  simplified example.
if, e.g., the problem is solved, one common message to the customers that their services are available again is generated and distributed by using the list of linked service events.
their information can be aggregated and processed only once.
in contrast to a resource-oriented perspective where all of the service events would have to be processed separately, the  service events can be linked together.
therefore, it seems more likely that a common resource which is  necessary for this service does not work properly or is not  available than to assume three independent service failures.
when referring to the service hierarchy, the provider can conclude in such a case that all services depend on dns.
in such a scenario the provider may receive service events from customers which indicate that ssh, web hosting  service, and video conference service are not available.
other service events can be generated by the provider of a service, if the provider himself detects a service malfunction.
a trouble ticket which is  generated from a customer report is a kind of such an 185 event.
service event: a service event indicates that a service does not work properly.
a network event refers to events like node up/down or link up/down whereas system events refer to events like server down or  authentication failure.
web services subservices resources figure 1: scenario to get a common understanding, we distinguish between different types of events: resource event: we use the term resource event for  network events and system events.
ssh sun1 provider video conf.
ssh dns proxy ip service dependency resource dependency user a user b user c customer sla web a video conf.
as displayed in the figure a service can depend on more than one resource and a resource can be used by one or more services.
both services and subservices depend on resources upon which they are provisioned.
in case of the services mentioned above such subservices are dns, proxy service, and ip service.
on the provider side the services use subservices for their provisioning.
the quality and cost issues of the subscribed services between a customer and a provider are agreed in slas.
a customer can allow several users to use a subscribed service.
several services like ssh, a web hosting service, or a video conference service are offered by a provider to its customers at the customer provider interface.
1 shows a general service scenario upon which we will discuss the importance of a service-oriented correlation.
