acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the members of the munich  network management (mnm) team for helpful discussions and valuable comments on previous versions of the paper.
another possibility to reduce the dependencies is to divide a service into its possible user interactions (e.g., an e-mail service into transactions like get mail, sent mail, etc) and to define the dependencies for each user interaction.
in case of a download from a web site there is only a dependency from the dns subservice at the  beginning, but after the address is resolved a download  failure is unlikely to have been caused by the dns.
to avoid having to much dependencies in a certain situation one could try to check whether the dependencies currently exist.
another important point is the precise definition of  dependency which has also been left out by many other  publications.
another issue is the use of active probing in the event correlation process which can improve the result, but can also lead to a  correlation delay.
in the latter case appropriate information has to be exchanged between the providers via the csm interface.
if a service does not perform properly, it has to be determined whether this is caused by the provider himself or by the subservice.
several issues have not been treated in detail so far, e.g., the consequences for the service-oriented event correlation if a subservice is offered by another provider.
in the future we are going to apply our workflow and information modeling for services offered by the leibniz supercomputing center going further into details.
to receive these benefits we presented our approach for performing the service-oriented event correlation as well as a modeling of the necessary correlation information.
in addition, customer reports can be linked together and therefore the processing effort can be reduced.
this helps to find the failure"s root cause earlier and to reduce costs for sla violations.
for an it service provider this new kind of event correlation makes it possible to automatically map problems with the current service quality onto resource  failures.
in our paper we showed the need for a service-oriented event correlation.
