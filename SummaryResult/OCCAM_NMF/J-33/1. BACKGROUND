experimental trials provide preliminary confirmation that the network formulations provide useful structure for implementing clearing algorithms. 
we then develop a family of network flow problems that capture corresponding classes of multiattribute call market optimizations.
this enables us to identify some general conditions under which the problem of multilateral matching can be decomposed into  bilateral matching problems.
we abstract, where appropriate, from the specific language used to express offers, characterizing expressiveness semantically in terms of what deals may be offered.
we provide the formal semantics of multiattribute offers in our framework in the next section.
as with analogous studies of combinatorial auctions [18], we intend that tradeoffs quantified in this work can be combined with incentive factors within a comprehensive overall approach to multiattribute auction design.
we conduct our  exploration independent of any consideration of strategic issues bearing on mechanism design.
in particular, we use the framework to  explore tradeoffs between expressive power of agent bids and  computational properties of auction clearing.
the goal of the present work is to develop a general framework for multiattribute call markets, to enable investigation of design  issues and possibilities.
the problem can be complicated by restrictions on overall assignments, as expressed in side constraints [16].
110 tions of trades, among the various potential trading-partner  pairings.
such price quotes are often computed based on  hypothetical clears, and so the clearing algorithm may be invoked more frequently than actual market clearing operations.
constructing an optimal overall matching may require consideration of many different  combina1 in the interim between clears, call markets may also disseminate price quotes providing summary information about the state of the auction [24].
multiattribute call markets are potentially much more complex.
because nothing happens between bids, the problem is to match a given new bid (say, an offer to buy) with the existing bids on the other (sell) side.
because the optimization is performed over an aggregated scope, call markets often enjoy liquidity and efficiency advantages over cdas [10].1 clearing a multiattribute cda is much like clearing a one-sided multiattribute auction.
in a call market, in contrast, bids accumulate until designated times (e.g., on a periodic or scheduled basis) at which the auction clears by determining a comprehensive match over the entire set of bids.
[12] and gong [14], both of which consider a matching problem for continuous double auctions (cdas), where deals are struck whenever a pair of  compatible bids is identified.
previous research on such auctions includes works by fink et al.
our emphasis is on two-sided multiattribute auctions, where  multiple buyers and sellers submit bids, and the objective is to construct a set of deals maximizing overall surplus.
side constraints have also been analyzed in the context of combinatorial auctions [6, 20].
other efforts focus on the optimization problem facing the bid taker, for example considering side constraints on the  combination of trades comprising an overall deal [4].
research on such auctions has, for example,  produced iterative mechanisms for eliciting cost functions  incrementally [19].
in the absence of a published buyer scoring function, agents on both sides may provide partial specifications of the deals they are willing to engage.
analogs of the classic first- and second-price auctions correspond to  firstand second-score auctions [8, 7].
this problem can be translated into the more familiar auction for a single good without attributes by computing a score for each attribute vector based on the seller valuation function, and have buyers bid scores.
in this case, such an  outcome would be arg maxi,x v(x) âˆ’ ci(x).
the role of the auction is to elicit these functions (possibly approximate or partial versions), and identify the surplus-maximizing deal.
models of procurement typically assume the buyer has a value function, v, ranging over the possible  configurations, x, and that each seller i can similarly be associated with a cost function ci over this domain.
existing research in multiattribute auctions has focused  primarily on one-sided mechanisms, which automate the process whereby a single agent negotiates with multiple potential trading partners [8, 7, 19, 5, 23, 22].
for example, a buyer may be willing to purchase a computer with a 2 ghz  processor, 500 mb of memory, and a 50 gb hard disk for a price no greater than $500, or the same computer with 1gb of memory for a price no greater than $600.
agents have varying preferences (or costs) associated with the possible configurations.
for example, in a multiattribute auction for  computers, the good may be defined by attributes such as processor speed, memory, and hard disk capacity.
such mechanisms provide traders with the ability to negotiate over a multidimensional space of potential deals, delaying  commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified.
a multiattribute auction is a market-based mechanism where goods are described by vectors of features, or attributes [3, 5, 8, 19].
