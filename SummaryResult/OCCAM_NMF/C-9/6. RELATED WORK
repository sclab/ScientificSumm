both systems lack support for resource aware distribution. 
globe  considers replication and caching.
fog [16] and globe [17] are basic middleware environments that support the fragmented object approach.
arm can be compared to edas but supports no resource aware distribution.
jgroup focus on the active replication of objects but lacks support for more flexible services like edas does.
on top of this basic middleware a replication management layer has been implemented called arm [15].
actively replicated objects are provided by jgroup [14] based on rmi.
javasymphony [12] and ibis [13] provide object mobility but are limited to the java programming language and focus on object oriented high performance computing.
but most important they follow a different resource management approach as they target the parallel execution of a large number of short and midterm tasks.
due to this  orientation they focus on different service models, provide no support for object mobility if even supporting a distributed object approach at all.
grid infrastructures like the globus-toolkit [11] provide services and mechanisms for distributed heterogeneous  environments to combine resources on demand to solve resource consuming and compute intensive tasks.
