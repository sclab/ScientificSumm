in a final step we need to implement some services that verify the usability of the whole edas project. 
this framework has to be extended to smoothly interact with the resource management and the edas architecture.
as described we have already an early implementation of the framework for the decentralized adaptive services.
in a next step the resource management will be integrate in an already implemented prototype of the edas  architecture.
for both problems we offer a solution, a currently  implemented simulation environment will verify their feasibility.
controlling and managing of resource limits including ensuring that the assigned resources are available (even in the context of node crashes) and the autonomous placement of services.
as described the resource management can be  decomposed in two main problems that have to be solved.
based on the fragmented object model and the  architecture of the edas environment, decentralized adaptive  services can be easily designed, implemented and executed.
