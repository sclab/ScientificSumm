the migration of service components can be necessary for various reasons, like node shutdown,  resource constraints, and the growth or shrinkage of a service environment. 
the service  environment thereby takes available resources, the requirements of the services, and the policies provided by the service  manager into account.
2. one of the main tasks of the service environment is to support the migration of services or service components especially between different home environments.
in most cases a service environment is spread over more than one administrative domain as shown in fig.
a service manager can start, stop, and  configure services through the interface of the service environment and decides which resources provided by home environments are accepted.
usually, a service environment is owned by one organization or community and dedicated to one project.
a service environment represents a scope of distribution for one or more services.
apart from providing system load and all kinds of resource-usage information to the  service environment, the home environment also notifies about all important system events like a node shutdown or crash.
each domain has a manager who can use that home environment to assign resources to service  environments and to revoke them.
every node provides a set of resources.
2 shows three domains each running a home environment that spans all nodes of the respective domains.
the home environment has the role of a mediator between the nodes of an institution and one or more service  environments, each running a set of services.
finally, the decentralized adaptive service is dynamically distributed within the scope of an associated service environment.
the service environment supports the execution of services belonging to the same project.
the service  environment is spread over a set of domains that support a certain project and relies on basic services from the corresponding home environments.
the home environment basically  manages resources of one or more nodes belonging to the same administrative domain or institution.
figure 1: fragmented object on three nodes edas has three major components: every node that  actively supports decentralized adaptive services provides a home environment.
