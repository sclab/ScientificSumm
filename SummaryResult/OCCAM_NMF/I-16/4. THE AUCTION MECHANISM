having described the market mechanism that the marketplace agent implements, we now go on to describe and evaluate an  advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents to adopt. 
in the case that no bids are placed within any auction, a default advert is displayed.
at the closing time of the auction the marketplace agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the winning bid, and informs the winning advertising agent that it was successful (the identity of the winning advertising agent is not  announced to all observers).
the marketplace agent announces the start and deadline of the auction, and collects sealed bids from each  advertising agent.
we consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.
thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a bluscreen  installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 .
indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.
in the absence of such a valuation, the attractive  economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our  attention to the second-price auction.
news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.
this may be because the bluscreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g.
however, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori  valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.
ing agents have a simple strategy of truthfully bidding their  valuation in each auction [8].

under this assumption, a  secondprice sealed-bid auction was shown to be effective, since  advertis2 this is implemented on a distributed mac os x based system using the bonjour networking protocol for service discovery.
in previous work, each advertising agent was assumed to have an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.
thus,  oneshot sealed bid auctions are used for the market mechanism of the marketplace agent.
as described above, bluscreen is designed to efficiency allocate advertising cycles in a distributed and timely manner.
