in each case, the advanced bidding strategy shows a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding strategy (p < 0.0005 in student"s t-test), and thus, gains improved exposure over all population compositions. 
figure 9 shows the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when the population is composed of different fractions of the two  bidding strategies.
finally, we show that a rational advertising agent, who has a choice of bidding strategy, would always opt to use the advanced bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy, regardless of the composition of the population that it finds itself in.
on average, we observe that advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy.
however, in all cases, the advanced bidding strategy  significantly outperforms the simple one (p < 0.0005 in student"s t-test).
finally,  increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any  advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain.
increasing the period of interest of each agent decreases the mean normalised exposure, since more  advertising agents are now competing for the same users.
increasing the departure rate causes an decrease in the mean normalised  exposure since advertising agents have less opportunities to expose users to their adverts.
in each case, keeping all other parameters fixed, we varied one parameter, and these results are shown in  figure 8. in general, we see the similar trends as before.
this is an important scenario since advertisers may wish to supply their own bidding agents, and thus, a homogeneous  population is not guaranteed.
in addition, we present results of experiments performed over a range of parameter values, and also with a mixed population of  advertising agents using both the advanced and simple bidding  strategies.
however, in all cases the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform the simple bidding agent (p < 0.0005 in student"s t-test), and its performance is within 7.5% of that of the optimal allocation that has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.
since this simple  bidding strategy does not take account of the number of users present, and in general, simply increases its bid price in each auction until it does in fact win one, this is not unexpected.
we then observe that in all cases, there is no statistically significant improvement in using the simple bidding strategy compared to  random allocation (p > 0.25 in student"s t-test).
we first observe the general result that as the number of advertising agents increases, and thus the competition between them increases, then the mean normalised exposure of all allocation mechanisms decreases.
figure 7 shows the results of this experiments.
thus a mean normalised exposure of 1 indicates that the agent managed to expose its advert to all of the users who were present during its period of interest (and a mean normalised exposure of 0 means that no users were exposed to the advert).
that is, the fraction of users who were detected by the bluscreen display during the period of interest of the advertising agent who were actually exposed to the agent"s advert.
for each simulation run, we measure the mean normalised exposure of each advert.
each  advertising agent is assigned an advert with a period of interest drawn from a poisson distribution with a mean of 8 advertising cycles, and these agents are initially allocated a budget equal to 10 times their period of interest.
using these four alternative allocation mechanisms, we ran repeated simulations of two hours of operation of the entire bluscreen  environment for a default set of parameters whereby the arrival and departure rate of the users are given by λa = 1/120s and λd = 1/480s, and the length of an advertising cycle is 120s.
optimal allocation: rather than implementing the auction  mechanism, the advertising cycle is allocated to the advertising agent that will derive the maximum utility from it, given  perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrive and depart in all future advertising cycles.
advanced bidding strategy: we implement the full auction  mechanism with a population of advertising agents using the  probabilistic models and the bidding strategy described here.
these advertising agents do not attempt to model the users or the auction environment in which they bid, but rather, they simply evenly allocate their remaining budget over the remaining advertising cycles.
simple bidding strategy: we implement the full auction  mechanism but with a population of advertising agents that  employ a simple bidding strategy.
in more detail, the four mechanisms that we compare are: random allocation: rather than implementing the auction  mechanism, the advertising cycle is randomly allocated to one of the advertising agents.

one of these mechanisms represents a simple alternative bidding strategy for the advertising agents, whilst the other two are centralised allocation mechanisms that represent expected utility between this and an even allocation is negliable.
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the advanced bidding  strategy developed within this paper we compare its performance to three alternative mechanisms.
