thus, in the next section we describe the prototype bluscreen system that motivates our work. 
despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an  audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.
thus, whilst casy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, groupcast is a  prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.
when several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the user"s profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.
user identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.
have presented a prototype  implementation of a system (groupcast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several  members of the audience [7].
by contrast, mccarthy et al.
system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the user"s preferences.
however, unlike the bluscreen figure 1: a deployed bluscreen prototype.
feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a user"s preferences.
the auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are  selected for presentation on public displays.
present a simulated system (casy) whereby a vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell  advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall [2].
gerding et al.
attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.
e-commerce sites such as amazon.com).
these systems  typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal  devices where the owner"s preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g.
the commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been  amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].
