we demonstrate that by crawling as few as n or 2n additional pages, our methods can give excellent global pagerank estimates.
we test our methods across a variety of localized domains, including site-specific domains and topic-specific domains.
the algorithms are all highly scalable in that, given a local  domain of size n, they use o(n) resources that include  computation time, bandwidth, and storage.
in this paper, we present well-motivated algorithms to  estimate the global pagerank values of a local domain.
such  information is needed to assess the value of pages in the localized search domain within the context of the web as a whole.
one disadvantage such systems have over large-scale search engines is the lack of global pagerank values.
they offer several  benefits over their large-scale counterparts in that they are  relatively inexpensive to build, and can provide more precise and complete search capability over their relevant domains.
localized search engines are small-scale systems that index a particular community on the web.
