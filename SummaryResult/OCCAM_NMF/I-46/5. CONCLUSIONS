we also suggest that mis might be better suited for modeling simple multi-agent domains, especially for human-oriented (as opposed to computer-oriented) design. 
we only suggest that there is a need for compact, modular and reasonably grounded models that are more expressive than  concurrent (epistemic) programs, and still allow for easier theoretical analysis than reactive modules.
we also do not mean to claim that our representations should  replace more elaborate modeling languages like promela or reactive modules.
the solutions, proposed in this paper, are not necessarily  perfect (for example, the impression functions ini seem to be the main source of non-modularity in mis, and can be perhaps  improved), but we believe them to be a step in the right direction.
we also conjecture that the complexity of model checking strategic ability for our representations is higher if we assume perfect information than if we assume imperfect  information.
our representations, called modular interpreted  systems, are: modular, in the sense that components can be changed, replaced, removed or added, with as little changes to the whole  representation as possible; more compact than traditional explicit  representations; and grounded, in the sense that the correspondences between the primitives of the model and the entities being  modeled are more immediate, giving a methodology for designing and implementing systems.
we have presented a new class of representations for open  multiagent systems.
