in addition, we argue that cheat detection techniques can be easily implemented at the  communication proxies if they are made aware of the game-play mechanics.
we show that such division of  authority leads to a smoother game playing experience by  implementing this mechanism in a massively multi-player online game called rpgquest.
using this architecture, we propose an authority assignment mechanism that divides the  authority for deciding the outcome of different actions/events that occur within the game between client and servers on a per action/event basis.
unlike proxy-based architectures that have been proposed in the literature where the proxies replicate all of the game state, the communication proxies in the proposed  architecture support clients that are in proximity to it in the  physical network and maintain information about selected  portions of the game space that are relevant only to the clients that they support.
the proposed game architecture consists of  distributed game clients that connect to game proxies (referred to as communication proxies) which forward game related messages from the clients to one or more game servers.
we present a proxy-based gaming architecture and  authority assignment within this architecture that can lead to  better game playing experience in massively multi-player  online games.
