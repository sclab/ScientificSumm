those challenges and more will be dealt with in future research. 
the results we presented are a first step towards an  expanded model that will cover all types of adversarial  environments, for example, environments that are non-zero-sum, and environments that contain natural agents that are not part of the direct conflict.
we presented empirical results, based on  connectfour log file analysis, that exemplify the model and the axioms for a bilateral instance of the environment.
the model is meant to be used as a guideline for  designing agents that need to operate in such adversarial  environments.
we used the sharedplans formalization to define the model and the axioms that agents can apply as behavioral guidelines.
bounded rational agent that is situated in an n-player,  zerosum environment.
we presented an adversarial environment model for a 2 these were later removed from the final analysis.
