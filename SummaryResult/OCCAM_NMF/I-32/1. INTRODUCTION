we discuss related work in section 4, and conclude and present future directions in section 5. 
section 3 presents the empirical  analysis and its results.
section 2 presents the model"s formalization.
the paper proceeds as follows.
in addition, we use the results presented in [9] to  discuss the importance of opponent modeling in our  connectfour adversarial domain.
we show that this game conforms to our environment definition, and analyze players" behavior using a large set of completed match log 550 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas files.
we then investigate the behavior of our model empirically using the connect-four board game.
we explore environment properties and the mental states of agents to derive  behavioral axioms; these behavioral axioms constitute a formal model that serves as a specification and design guideline for agent design in such settings.
the model uses different modality operators, and its main foundations are the sharedplans [4] model for collaborative behavior.
in this paper, we develop a formal, axiomatized model for bounded rational agents that are situated in a zero-sum adversarial environment.
in addition, traditional search methods (like min-max) do not make use of a model of the opponent, which has proven to be a valuable addition to adversarial planning [9, 3, 11].
in these latter environments  especially, using a utility-based adversarial search (such as the min-max algorithm) does not always provide an adequate solution; the payoff function might be quite complex or  difficult to quantify, and there are natural computational  limitations on bounded rational agents.
simple zero-sum encounters exist of course in various  twoplayer games (e.g., chess, checkers), but they also exist in n-player games (e.g., risk, diplomacy), auctions for a  single good, and elsewhere.
our paper addresses this issue by  providing a formal, axiomatized mental state model for a subset of adversarial domains, namely simple zero-sum adversarial environments.
however, none of this research dealt with adversarial domains and their implications for agent behavior.
models of cooperation and teamwork have been  extensively explored in mas through the axiomatization of  mental states (e.g., [8, 4, 5]).
we call these environments adversarial environments, and call the clashing agents adversaries.
when these types of interactions occur,  environments require appropriate behavior from the agents situated in them.
when interactions are guided by diverse interests,  participants may have to overcome disagreements,  uncooperative interactions, and even intentional attempts to damage one another.
mas research, however, soon began to consider  interacting agents with individuated interests, as representatives of different humans or organizations with non-identical  interests.
early research in multiagent systems (mas) considered cooperative groups of agents; because individual agents had limited resources, or limited access to information (e.g.,  limited processing power, limited sensor coverage), they worked together by design to solve problems that individually they could not solve, or at least could not solve as efficiently.
