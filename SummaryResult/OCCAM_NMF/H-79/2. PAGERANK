though much work has been done on optimizing the pagerank computation (see e.g., [25] and [6]), it remains a relatively slow, computationally expensive property to compute. 
it requires large amounts of memory (or very smart caching schemes that slow the computation down even further), and if spread across multiple machines, requires significant communication between them.
computing pagerank requires iterating over these billions of links multiple times (until convergence).
our collection of 5 billion pages contains approximately 370 billion links.
pagerank is computationally expensive.
a page gives an equal share of its quality to each page it points to.
an alternative view for equation (1) is that each page is assigned a quality, p(j).
the intuition is, because a random surfer would end up at the page more frequently, it is likely a better page.
because equation (1) is recursive, it must be iteratively evaluated until p(j) converges (typically, the initial distribution for p(j) is uniform).
if averaged over a sufficient number of steps, the probability the surfer is on page j at some point in time is given by the formula: ∑∈ + − = ji i ip n jp b f )()1( )( α α (1) where fi is the set of pages that page i links to, and bj is the set of pages that link to page j. the pagerank score for node j is defined as this probability: pr(j)=p(j).
in order to reduce the effect of dead-ends or endless cycles the surfer will occasionally jump to a random page with some small probability α, or when on a page with no out-links.
imagine a web surfer who jumps from web page to web page, choosing with uniform probability which link to follow at each step.
we can take advantage of this linkage information to order web pages according to their perceived quality.
as such, they are indicative of the quality of the pages to which they point - when creating a page, an author presumably chooses to link to pages deemed to be of good quality.
in general, links are made by people.
the basic idea behind pagerank is simple: a link from a web page to another can be seen as an endorsement of that page.
