we have only begun to explore the options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional features, other machine learning techniques, and additional sources of data. 
the machine learning component of frank gives it the additional benefit of being more robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further developments in the machine learning community in areas such as adversarial classification.
a qualitative evaluation of the top documents shows that frank is less technology-biased than pagerank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that web users, rather than web authors, visit.
by combining many static features, frank achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise accuracy than pagerank alone.
we have demonstrated that pagerank does not provide a very good static ranking; there are many simple features that individually out perform pagerank.
a good static ranking is an important component for today"s search engines and information retrieval systems.
