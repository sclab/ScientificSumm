a simple example to highlight the ideas presented in the paper appears in  section 8 and section 9 concludes the paper. 
section 7 describes the cosmic middleware, which may be used to specify the  interaction between sentient objects.
gear is then described in section 5 and section 6 focuses on  temporal aspects of the interactions.
then, in section 4, we describe the  componentbased approach that allows composition of objects.
in section 3 we  introduce the fundamental notions and abstractions that we adopt in this work to describe the interactions taking place in the system.
the paper is organized as follows.
they are established prior to interaction to  reserve the needed computational and network resources for highly predictable event dissemination.
reliability and timeliness) properties of the envisaged applications, that is, in allowing the enforcement of quality attributes.
in fact, event channels play a  fundamental role in securing the functional and non-functional (e.g.
this is  complemented by the notion of event channels (ec), which are  abstractions of the underlying network while being abstracted by the event layer.
an appropriate middleware is presented which reflects these needs and allows to specify events which have quality attributes to express temporal constraints.
the paper devotes particular  attention to this issue by discussing the temporal aspects of interactions and the needs for predictability.
additionally, the event layer abstraction is also adequate for the proper handling of the non-functional requirements, namely reliability and timeliness, which are particularly  stringent in real-time settings.
in fact, the generic event layer hides the different communication  channels, including the interactions through the environment.
this provides the necessary background to introduce the generic-events architecture (gear), which describes the event-based interaction between the components via a generic event layer while allowing the seamless integration of physical and computer information flows.
this view is complemented by  providing an outline of the component-based system construction and, in particular, by showing that it is possible to  compose larger applications from basic components, following an hierarchical composition approach.
therefore, the paper starts by clarifying several issues concerning our view of the system, about the interactions that may take place and about the information flows.
to its components, we consider that the environment surrounding the application also plays a relevant role in this respect.
unlike classical approaches that confine the possible interactions to the  application boundaries, i.e.
when choosing the appropriate interaction paradigm it is of fundamental importance to address the challenging  issues of the envisaged sentient applications.
this paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware, supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on event-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the system.
in terms of interaction paradigms, and although the use of event-based models appears to be a convenient solution [10, 22], these often lack the  appropriate support for non-functional requirements like reliability, timeliness or security.
however, classical event/object  models are usually software oriented and, as such, when  trans28 ported to a real-time, embedded systems setting, their  harmony is cluttered by the conflict between, on the one side, send/receive of software events (message-based), and on the other side, input/output of hardware or real-world events, register-based.
looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical parts, hardware, software and a network interface.
unfortunately, when  facing the specific characteristics of the target systems, the shortcomings of current architectures and middleware  interaction paradigms become apparent.
in order to deal with these challenges, it is of  fundamental importance to use adequate high-level models,  abstractions and interaction paradigms.
the anticipated challenging characteristics of these applications include autonomy, responsiveness and safety criticality, large scale, geographical dispersion,  mobility and evolution.
we believe that in a future networked physical world a new class of applications will emerge, composed of a myriad of smart sensors and actuators to assess and  control aspects of their environments and autonomously act in response to it.
in recent years we have seen the continuous improvement of technologies that are relevant for the construction of  distributed embedded systems, including trustworthy visual, auditory, and location sensing [11], communication and  processing.
