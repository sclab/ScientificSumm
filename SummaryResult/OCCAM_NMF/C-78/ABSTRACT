they are established prior to interaction to reserve the needed computational and network resources for highly predictable event dissemination.
this is complemented by the notion of event channels which are abstractions of the  underlying network and allow to enforce quality attributes.
an appropriate middleware is presented which reflects these needs and  allows to specify events which have quality attributes to  express temporal constraints.
the interactions through the environment.
the generic event layer hides the different communication channels including âˆ—this work was partially supported by the ec, through project ist-2000-26031 (cortex), and by the fct, through the large-scale informatic systems  laboratory (lasige) and project posi/1999/chs/33996  (defeats).
the generic event architecture gear is  introduced which describes the event-based interaction between the components via a generic event layer.
it starts by an outline of the component-based system construction.
the paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on events-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the  system.
larger autonomous components may be composed recursively from these  building blocks.
they are able to spontaneously disseminate information in response to events observed in the physical environment or to events received from other component via the network interface.
looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical  components, hardware and software and a network interface, thus these components have different characteristics compared to pure software components.
a crucial design decision is the choice of the appropriate abstractions and interaction mechanisms.
the challenging characteristics of these applications include sentience and autonomy of components, issues of  responsiveness and safety criticality, geographical dispersion, mobility and evolution.
to a large extent, such systems operate proactively and independently of direct  human control driven by the perception of the environment and the ability to organize respective computations dynamically.
examples range in telematics, traffic management, team robotics or home automation to name a few.
in a future networked physical world, a myriad of smart sensors and actuators assess and control aspects of their  environments and autonomously act in response to it.
