these attributes must be mapped to the respective properties of the underlying network structure. 
it disseminates events and allows the  network independent specification of quality attributes.
as we will see in the following section, the notion of an event channel represents this construct in our architecture.
instead, a high level construct for interaction across boundaries is needed which allows to specify the quality of dissemination and exploits the  knowledge about body and environment to assess the feasibility of quality constraints.
their introduction obeyed to our belief that a single mechanism to provide quality measures for  interactions is not appropriate.
the notions of body-environment and wan-of-cans are very useful when defining interaction properties across such boundaries.
however, several platoons united by their cans may interact with each other and  objects further away, through some wider-range, possible fixed networking substrate, hence the concept of wan-of-cans.
at the network level, the wireless network represents the respective can.
correspondingly, the platoon can be seen itself as an object composed of a collection of  cooperating vehicles, its body being the environment encapsulated by the platoon zone.
in the above example, a vehicle may be a sentient object, whose body is composed of the respective lower level objects (sensors and actuators) which are connected by the internal network (see figure 1).
a can defines the dissemination quality which can be expected by the cooperating objects.
on the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a  certain can.
a body is similar to a cell membrane and represents a quality of service  container for the sentient objects inside.
the notion of body and environment is derived from the recursively  defined component-based object model.
at the network level, we assume the wan-of-cans  structure [27] to model the different networks.
at the abstraction level of sentient objects, such  heterogeneity is reflected by the notion of body-vs-environment.
finally, there may be multiple platoons of vehicles which are coordinated by an additional wireless network layer.
on the other hand, the  vehicles are communicating with others in the platoon via a direct wireless link.
inside a vehicle there may be a field-bus like can [8, 9], ttp/a [17] or lin [20], with a comparatively low bandwidth.
consider a  platoon of cooperating vehicles.
thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics.
such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.
secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.
firstly, the components may have severe performance  constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.
however, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions,  originating from the components heterogeneity in such a  largescale setting.
as we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.
4.2 encapsulation and scoping now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.
from an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments.
this means that it should be possible to define  cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.
on the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.
together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.
each robot is made of several components,  corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.
to give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.
in fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.
while in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.
however, there is a  subtle difference between both cases.
additionally, it is interesting to  observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment  internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.
signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal  communication network.
observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the  object controlling a wlan transmitter and some wlan  receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object  interaction takes place when the object responsible for the gps 30 g p s r e c e p t i o n w i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n d o p p l e r r a d a r p h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k o b j e c t ' s b o d y i n t e r n a l n e t w o r k figure 1: component-aware sentient object  composition.
this is illustrated in figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient  objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.
on the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware component"s structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.
therefore, it should be  possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient  objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.
furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the  envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.
this interface hides the internal  hardware/software structure of the object, which may be  complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or  actuator.
we refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.
4.1 component-based system construction sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.
in this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects.
