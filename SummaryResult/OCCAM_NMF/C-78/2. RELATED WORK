secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously  defined, no model to specify temporal properties for  clusterto-corba or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 
however, in contrast to the event channel model introduced in this paper, all  communication inside a cluster relies on a single technical solution of a synchronous communication channel.
islands of tight control may be realized by a control network and cooperate via wired or wireless networks covering a large number of these subnetworks.
the basic structure is similar to the wan-of-cans  structure which has been introduced in the cortex project [4].
a corba gateway allows to access sensor data and write actuator data by means of an interface file system (ifs).
a special master node enforces the temporal properties in the cluster subnet.
the clusters form isolated subnetworks.
smart transducers are organized in clusters that are  connected to a corba system by a gateway.
a new scheme to integrate smart devices in a corba  environment is proposed in [17] and has lead to the proposal of a standard by the object management group (omg) [26].
however, in these approaches the support for timeliness or  dependability issues does not exist or is only very limited.
they are targeted for the can-bus [9], a popular  network developed for the automotive industry.
there are efforts to implement corba for control  networks, tailored to connect sensor and actuator components [15, 19].
such a central component is not available in an infrastructure envisaged in our system architecture and the developed middleware tao (the ace orb) is quite complex and unsuitable to be directly integrated in smart devices.
the events are routed via a central event server which provides scheduling functions to support the real-time requirements.
in [10] a real-time event system for corba has been introduced.
secondly, they are not created to support inter-operability between tiny smart devices with substantial resource  constraints.
intended for large systems and requiring quite complex infrastructures, these event systems do not consider  stringent quality aspects like timeliness and dependability issues.
event-based systems in general have been introduced to meet the requirements of applications in which entities  spontaneously generate information and disseminate it [1, 25, 22].
it is inspired by many research efforts in very different  areas.
our work considers a wired physical world in which a very large number of autonomous components cooperate.
