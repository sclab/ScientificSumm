it seems that the notation of instantaneous load, which represents the  dynamics of cognitive load over time, is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance the overall performance in human-agent collaborations.
to better understand and measure cognitive load, xie and salvendy [16] introduced a conceptual framework, which distinguishes instantaneous load, peak load,  accumulated load, average load, and overall load.
however, one important drawback of  secondary task performance, as noted by paas [12], is that it can interfere considerably with the primary task  (competing for limited capacity), especially when the primary task is complex.
its  performance can be measured in terms of reaction time, accuracy, and error rate.
a secondary task can be as simple as detecting a visual or auditory signal but requires sustained attention.
the level of cognitive load can thus be  manifested by the secondary task performance: the subject is getting overloaded if the secondary task performance drops.
consequently, performance in a secondary task deteriorates as the difficulty or priority of the primary task increases.
from the resource allocation perspective, assuming a fixed cognitive capacity, any increase in cognitive resources required by the primary task must inevitably decrease resources available for the  secondary task [7].
secondary task techniques are based on the assumption that performance on a secondary task reflects the level of  cognitive load imposed by a primary task [15].
although physiological measures are sometimes highly  sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and  performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.
selfratings may appear questionable and restricted, especially when instantaneous load needs to be measured over time.
measures of heart activity, brain  activity, eye activity), and secondary task techniques [12].
cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental load, mental effort, and performance using rating scales,  psychophysiological (e.g.
this comes to the issue of measuring cognitive load, which has proven difficult for cognitive scientists.
hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in  order to enhance human performance.
due to limited capacity, when greater effort is required to process information, less capacity  remains for the storage of information.
in addition, working memory is used both for holding and for  processing information [1].
the model  suggests that processing resources (cognitive capacity) are  independently allocated to the three processes.
the  encoding process selectively maps messages in sensory stores that are relevant to a person"s goals into working memory; the storage process consolidates the newly encoded  information into chunks, and form associations and schema to  facilitate subsequent recalls; the retrieval process searches the associated memory network for a specific element/schema and reactivates it into working memory.
lang"s information-processing model [7] consists of three major processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval.
it also has an  assessment dimension reflecting the measurable concepts of  mental load (imposed exclusively by the task and environmental demands), mental effort (the cognitive capacity actually  allocated to the task), and performance.

it has a causal dimension including causal factors that can be characteristics of the subject (e.g.
according to the cognitive load theory [11], cognitive load is defined as a multidimensional construct representing the load that a particular task imposes on the performer.
cognitive load studies are, by and large,  concerned about working memory capacity and how to  circumvent its limitations in human problem-solving activities such as learning and decision making.
most cognitive  scientists [8] believe that human information-processing system consists of an executive component and three main  information stores: (a) sensory store, which receives and retains information for one second or so; (b) working (or  shortterm) memory, which refers to the limited capacity to hold (approximately seven elements at any one time [9]), retain (for several seconds), and manipulate (two or three  information elements simultaneously) information; and (c)  longterm memory, which has virtually unlimited capacity [1] and contains a huge amount of accumulated knowledge organized as schemata.
