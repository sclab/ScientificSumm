the usefulness of shared belief maps was also demonstrated during the experiments. 
it allows group members to effectively represent and reason about shared mental models; (3) experiments were conducted to evaluate the hmm-based cognitive/processing load models and the impacts of multi-party communication on the  evolving of team smms.
the major contribution of this research includes (1) hmm-based load models were proposed for an agent to estimate its human partner"s cognitive load and other hap teammates" processing loads; (2) the shared  belief map concept was introduced and implemented.
in this paper, we  investigated several factors surrounding the challenging  problem of evolving shared mental models of teams composed of human-agent-pairs.
recent research attention on human-centered teamwork highly demands the design of agent systems as cognitive aids that can model and exploit human partners" cognitive capacities to offer help unintrusively.
