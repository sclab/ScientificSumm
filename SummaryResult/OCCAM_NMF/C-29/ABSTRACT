the load imbalance of the optimization time of the trial structure may also cause performance degradation.
the  experimental result shows that conflex-g achieved a speedup of 56.5 times in the case of the 1bl1 molecule, where the molecule consists of a large number of atoms, and each trial structure optimization requires significant time.
this can eliminate unnecessary communication and initialization at each call in conflex-g.  conflexg can achieve performance comparable to conflex mpi and can exploit more computing resources by allowing the use of a cluster of multiple clusters in the grid.
in this model, when the initialization procedure is defined in the rpc module, the module is automatically  initialized at the time of invocation by calling the initialization procedure.
omnirpc provides a restricted  persistence model to support the parametric search applications.
in order to explore many  conformation of large bio-molecules, conflex-g generates trial structures of the molecules and allocates jobs to  optimize a trial structure with a reliable molecular mechanics method in the grid.
in this paper, we report the performance of conflex-g in a grid testbed of several geographically distributed pc clusters.
we have implemented conflex-g using a grid rpc system called omnirpc.
conflex-g is the grid-enabled version of a molecular  conformational space search program called conflex.
