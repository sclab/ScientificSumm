argument a is said to affect the status of another argument a if changing the status of a will change the status of a . 
definition 2.7. if there is an acceptable argument for a proposition p, then the status of p is accepted, while if there is not an acceptable argument for p, the status of p is not accepted.
an acceptable argument is one which is, in some sense, proven since all the arguments which might undermine it are themselves undermined.
the set a(δ) of acceptable arguments of the argumentation system a(δ), undercut, pref is [1] the least fixpoint of a function f: a ⊆ a(δ) f(a) = {(s, p) ∈ a(δ) | (s, p) is defended by a} definition 2.6. the set of acceptable arguments for an argumentation system a(δ), undercut, pref is recursively defined as: a(δ) = [ fi≥0(∅) = aundercut,pref ∪ h[ fi≥1(aundercut,pref ) i an argument is acceptable if it is a member of the acceptable set, and a proposition is acceptable if it is the conclusion of an acceptable argument.
we write aundercut,pref to denote the set of all non-undercut arguments and arguments defending themselves against all their undercutting arguments.
• a set of arguments a defends a1 iff for every a2 that undercuts a1, where a1 does not defend itself against a2, then there is some a3 ∈ a such that a3 undercuts a2 and a2 does not defend itself against a3.
otherwise, a1 does not defend itself.
• if a2 undercuts a1 then a1 defends itself against a2 iff a1 pref a2.
the preference order makes it possible to distinguish  different types of relations between arguments: definition 2.5. let a1, a2 be two arguments of a(δ).
we can now define the argumentation system we will use: definition 2.4. an argumentation system is a triple: a(δ), undercut, pref such that: • a(δ) is a set of the arguments built from δ, • undercut is a binary relation representing the defeat relationship between arguments, undercut ⊆ a(δ) × a(δ), and • pref is a pre-ordering on a(δ) × a(δ).
if a1 is  preferred to a2, we say that a1 is stronger than a2.
a1 is preferred to a2 according to pref , a1 pref a2, iff level(support(a1)) > level(support(a2)).
definition 2.3. let a1 and a2 be arguments in a(δ).
note that the strength of a belief as used in this context is a separate concept from the notion of support discussed earlier.
in other words, s is only as strong as its weakest member.
, δn such that beliefs in δi are all equally preferred and are preferred over elements in δj where i > j. the preference level of a nonempty subset s ⊂ δ, where different elements s ∈ s may belong to different layers δi, is valued at the highest numbered layer which has a member in s and is referred to as level(s).
we consider all information  available to an agent, δ, to be stratified into non-overlapping subsets δ1, .
to capture the fact that some beliefs are more strongly held than others, we assume that any set of beliefs has a preference order over it.
in other words, an argument is undercut if and only if there is another argument which has as its conclusion the negation of an element of the support for the first argument.
a1 undercuts a2 iff ∃¬p ∈ support(a2) such that p ≡ conclusion(a1).
in general, since δ may be inconsistent, arguments in a(δ), the set of all arguments which can be made from δ, may conflict, and we make this idea precise with the notion of undercutting: definition 2.2. let a1 and a2 be arguments in a(δ).
thus we talk of p being supported by the argument (s, p).
s is called the support of a, written s = support(a) and p is the conclusion of a, written p = conclusion(a).
definition 2.1. an argument a is a pair (s, p) where p is a formula of l and s a subset of δ such that (i) s is consistent; (ii) s p; and (iii) s is minimal, so no proper subset of s satisfying both (1) and (2) exists.
in other dialogue games, such as 1006 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas those in [2], csα may contain things that cannot be derived from σα.
in some dialogue games, such as those in [18] anything in csα is either in σα or can be derived from it.
thus in a dialogue between two agents α and β, δα = σα ∪ csα ∪ csβ, so the commitment store csα can be loosely thought of as a subset of δα consisting of the assertions that have been made public.
in contrast, the contents of σα are private to α. note that in the description that follows, we assume that is the classical inference relation, that ≡ stands for logical equivalence, and we use δ to denote all the information available to an agent.
we refer to this as an agent"s public knowledge, since it contains information that is shared with other agents.
agent α also maintains the set of its past utterances, called the  commitment store, csα.
a dialogue is a sequence of messages passed between two or more members of a set of agents a. an agent α maintains a knowledge base, σα, containing formulas of a propositional language l and having no deductive closure.
we begin by introducing the formal system of  argumentation that underpins our approach, as well as the  corresponding terminology and notation, all taken from [2, 8, 17].
