our work identifes the limits on such rhetorical manoeuvering, showing when it can and cannot have an effect. 
relevance is a topic of increasing interest in argumentation-based dialogue because it relates to the scope that an agent has for applying strategic manoeuvering to obtain the outcomes that it requires [19, 22, 24].
in this paper, we extend the work of [18] by considering the role of relevance - the relationship between utterances in a dialogue.
the dialogue game view overlaps with work on conversation policies (see, for example, [6, 10]), but differs in considering the entire dialogue rather than dialogue segments.
viewing  dialogues in this way, as in [2, 21], provides a powerful  framework for analysing the formal properties of dialogues, and for identifying suitable protocols under which dialogues can be conducted [18, 20].
this work influenced the field in a number of ways, perhaps most deeply in framing multi-agent interactions as dialogue games in the tradition of hamblin [13].
the work of walton and krabbe [27], popularised in the multiagent systems community by reed [23], has been  particularly influential in the field of argumentation-based  dialogue.

early examples of argumentation-based approaches to multiagent agreement include the work of dignum et al.
one mechanism for achieving agreement is through the use of argumentation - where one agent tries to convince another agent of  something during the course of some dialogue.
finding ways for agents to reach agreements in  multiagent systems is an area of active research.
