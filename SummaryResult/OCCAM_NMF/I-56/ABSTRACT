performance  evaluation shows that the uma strategy can outperform some  existing mechanisms in terms of computational cycles.
to this end, a new strategy called unsolicited mutual advice (uma) is proposed.
a major motivation for this bdi  framework is that it not only provides a conceptually clearer  understanding of existing dcsp algorithms from an agent model  perspective, but also opens up the opportunities to extend and  develop new strategies for dcsp.
by anchoring the dcsp search on automated negotiation, we show that several well-known dcsp algorithms are actually mechanisms that can reach agreements through a common belief-desire-intention (bdi) protocol, but using different strategies.
the  distributed constraint satisfaction problem (dcsp) is one that  entails several agents to search for an agreement, which is a  consistent combination of actions that satisfies their mutual constraints in a shared environment.
this paper presents a novel, unified distributed constraint  satisfaction framework based on automated negotiation.
