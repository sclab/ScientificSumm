the idea of dcsp agents using different strategies in the same environment will also be investigated. 
future work will attempt to formally  establish this property, as well as formalize other existing dscp algorithms as bdi negotiation mechanisms, including the recent endeavor that employs a group mediator [5].
it was observed from our simulations that uma possesses the completeness property.
empirical results and our discussion suggest that uma is superior to abt, awc and dbo in some specific aspects.
towards the latter, we have proposed and formulated a new strategy - the uma strategy.
importantly, this means that it might furnish a unified framework for dcsp that not only provides a clearer bdi agent-theoretic view of existing dcsp approaches, but also opens up the opportunities to enhance or develop new strategies.
our work shows that several  wellknown dcsp algorithms, namely abt, awc and dbo, can be described as mechanisms sharing the same proposed protocol, and only differ in the strategies employed for the reasoning steps per negotiation round as governed by the protocol.
applying automated negotiation to dcsp, this paper has  proposed a protocol that prescribes the generic reasoning of a dcsp agent in a bdi architecture.
