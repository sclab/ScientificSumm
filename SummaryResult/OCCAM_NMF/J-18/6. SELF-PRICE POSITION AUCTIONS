moreover, we will find a valid mediator that does the job. 
we will show that in this case 285 there is a way to implement the vcg outcome function in a self-price position auction.
we will define ex post equilibrium and the notion of implementation by mediation without explicitly modeling well-defined games.
nevertheless, in the next section we will analyze mediators in position auctions, which use the first-arrival rule.
hence, efficient modeling as a game may be untractable.
this raises a lot of additional modeling  problems, such as determining the relationship between the time a player decides to submit a bid and the time in which this bid is actually recorded.
to do this, one has to allow a player not only to submit a bid but also to decide about the time of the bid.
in particular, it is not clear how to model a position auction with the first-arrival rule as a game with  incomplete information.
when one attempts to directly model position auctions that use the first-arrival rule without these modeling choices he tackles a lot of  modeling problems.
as we previously discussed, the fixed and random  priority rules are just convenient ways to model the first-arrival rule, which is common in practice.
the proof of the impossibility theorem for the random priority rule uses the fact that the particular bad priority rule used in the proof of theorem 6, has a positive probability.
however, as we have already said, all our results including this theorem hold also for the tie breaking rule defined by the random priority rule.
vn = 10 and v1 = v2 = · · · = vn−1 = 5. the vcg outcome function assigns to this v an allocation, in which player n receives position 1 and player 1 receives position 2. the payments of players n and 1 are both equal to 5. in order to implement such an outcome, a mediator must bid 5 on behalf of player n (so that this player pays 5), and it must bid less than 5 on behalf of any other player, because otherwise another player receives position 1. note that the bid of any other player cannot equal 5 because every other player has an higher priority than n. in particular, even if player 1 gets indeed position 2 he will pay less than 5. hence, no mediator can implement the vcg outcome function in g.2 the proof of theorem 6 heavily uses the fixed priority rule assumption.
let v ∈ v be the following valuation profile.
there is no mediator that  implements the vcg outcome function in g. proof.
theorem 6. let g be a self-price position auction with more than one position.
the proof in this example can be easily generalized to show that the vcg outcome function can be implemented by a valid  mediator in a self-price position auction, in which there is one position and an arbitrary number of players, n ≥ 2. next we show that it is impossible to implement the vcg outcome function, even by a non-valid mediator, in a  selfprice position auction which has more than one position (m > 1).
let g be a self-price position auction as described at  section 2. at example 1 we showed that when there is one position and two players, the vcg outcome function is  implemented by a valid mediator in this auction.
