formally, a mediator m for g, is valid if for every subset s ⊆ n and every player i ∈ s wi(vi, ms(vs), b−s) ≥ 0 for every b−s ∈ b−s and every vs ∈ vs. 
a mediator for g is valid, if for every player, using the t-strategy guarantees a  nonnegative level of utility.
in contrast, for every c > 1, if say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates directly and bids less than cv1, then the t-strategy yields a negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1. this motivates our definition of valid mediators: let g be a position auction.
it is interesting to note that this simple example can not be extended to general self-price position auctions, as will be discussed in section 4. while each of the mediators mc in example 1 implements the vcg outcome function, the mediator with c = 1 has a distinct characteristic: a player who uses the t-strategy cannot get a negative utility.
if v1 > v2 and player 2 bids directly v2 (without using the mediator services), then bidding directly v1 is better for player 1 than using the  tstrategy: in the former case player 1"s utility is 0 and in the latter case her utility is negative.
note however, that the t-strategy is not a dominant strategy when c > 1; e.g.
obviously each of the mediators mc implements the vcg outcome function.
if v1 < v2, then the t-strategy yields 0 to player 1, and any other strategy yields a non-positive utility.
if he reports ˆv1 < v2 his utility will be 0. if player 1 does not use the mediator, he should bid at least cv2 in order to get the positions, and therefore his utility cannot exceed v1 − v2.
if player 1 deviates by using the mediator"s services and reporting ˆv1 ≥ v2 his utility is still v1 − v2.
hence, 1"s utility is v1 −v2.
indeed, assume player 2 reports his type v2 to the mediator, and consider player 1. if v1 ≥ v2 then by using the t-strategy player 1 receives the position and pays v2.
if only one player uses the mediator services, say player i, then mediator mc bids bi = cˆvi on behalf of i. we claim that for every c > 1, the t-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game generated by mc .
282 players use the mediator"s services and send him the types ˆv = (ˆv1, ˆv2), then all mediators act similarly and as follows: if ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 the mediator makes the following bids on behalf of the players: b1 = ˆv2, and b2 = 0. if ˆv2 > ˆv1, the mediator makes the bids b1 = 0, b2 = ˆv1.
it is commonly  conjectured that except for some extremely artificial combinatorial auctions , the vcg combinatorial auctions are the only ones with dominant strategies (see [10]).
assume both 7 actually, it can be shown that if a strategy profile b in a position auction is an ex post equilibrium then for every player i bi is a dominant strategy.
we define a family of mediators mc , c ≥ 1, each of them implements the vcg position auction.
the  corresponding vcg position auction is a standard second-price  auction.
we demonstrate our definitions so far by a simple  example: example 1. consider a self-price auction g = g(α, p) with 2 players and one position, with α1 = 1. that is, g is a standard two-person first-price auction.
let m be a mediator for g. we say the m implements the vcg outcome function in g, or that it implements ϕvcg in g if the  tstrategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in gm, and ϕm = ϕvcg .
definition: let g be a position auction .
this outcome function is defined as follows: ϕvcg (v) = (s(v), qvcg (v)).
given a position auction g our goal is to construct a mediator that would implement the outcome function of the vcg position auction.
in contrast, in the vcg  position auction the truth-reporting strategy is a dominant strategy for every player, and the resulting allocation is  efficient.
function by mediation in general, except for the vcg position auction we do not expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium.7 therefore, the behavior of the participants in most position auctions cannot be analytically predicted, and in practice it can form a non-efficient allocation: an allocation that does not maximize social surplus.
