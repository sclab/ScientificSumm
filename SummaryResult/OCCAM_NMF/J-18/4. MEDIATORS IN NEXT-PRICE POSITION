hence a player which used the t-strategy will not pay more than his value.
since the mediator submits the reported values on behalf of the other players, these other players will not pay more than their reported values.
consider the situation in which a subset of players, s,  participate directly in the auction.
if all players choose the mediator then by the first part of lemma 1 each player which uses the t-strategy will not pay more than his value.
finally we show that m is valid.
hence, player i does not gain from participating directly in the auction.
therefore αk(vi − pk(b(v))) ≥ αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)).
283 utility is zero and therefore deviating is not worthwhile for i. suppose j ∈ k. then αk(vi − pk(b(v))) = αk(vi − pvcg k (v)) ≥ αj(vi − pvcg j (v−i, bi)) ≥ αj(vi − v(j+1)), where the first equality follows from ϕm = ϕvcg , the first inequality follows since vcg is truthful, and the second  inequality follows from the first part of lemma 1. since pj is position j"s payment function in the next-price position auction, αj(vi − v(j+1)) = αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)).
if j /∈ k then player i"s 8 recall that s(b, i) denotes the position of player i under the bid profile b, and δ(b, j) denotes the set of players assigned to position j. whenever j ∈ k, we slightly abuse notations, and also refer to δ(b, j) as the player that is assigned to position j.
hence j = s((v−i, bi), i).
therefore, since ϕm = ϕvcg , s(b(v), i) = k. let j be player i"s position in the deviation.
let k = s(v, i).
let bi be player i"s bid.
hence, v−i is the vector of bids submitted by the mediator.
assume that player i is the only player that participates directly in the auction.
fix some v ∈ v .
next we show that it is not beneficial for a single player i ∈ n to participate in the auction directly if all other players use the t-strategy.
note that by the truthfulness of vcg, it is not beneficial for any player i to miss report her value to the mediator, given that all other players use the t-strategy.
we proceed to prove that the t-strategy is an ex-post equilibrium.
hence, ϕm = ϕvcg .
therefore qi(b(v)) = qvcg i (v) for every i ∈ n. this shows that q(b(v)) = qvcg (v) for all v ∈ v .
observe that for every player i such that s(b(v), i) ∈ k ps(b(v),i)(b(v)) = pvcg s(v,i)(v).
this completes the proof that s(b(v)) = s(v) for all v ∈ v .
therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
therefore pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg s(v,l)−1(v), which yields bi(v) > bl(v).
since s(v, i) ≤ s(v, l) − 1, by the second part of lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v).
that is v(j+1) = vi, and therefore by the second part of lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg s(v,i)(v).
let j + 1 = s(v, i).
2. vi > vl.
therefore bi(v) ≥ bl(v), which yields s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
since s(v, i) < s(v, l), the fixed priority rule implies that i < l. by the second part of lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v).
1. vi = vl.
if s(v, i) > 1, we  distinguish between two cases.
we first show it for s(v, i) = 1, that is δ(v, 1) = i. in this case bδ(v,1)(v) > bj(v) for every j = i, s(b(v), i) = 1. therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
it is sufficient to show that whenever 1 ≤ s(v, i) < s(v, l) ≤ m + 1 for some i = l, then s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l).
we have to show that s(b(v)) = s(v) and that q(b(v)) = qvcg (v): we begin by showing that s(b(v)) = s(v).
let v ∈ v be an arbitrary valuation vector.
for every s ⊆ n such that s = n and for every vs ∈ vs let ms(v) = vs. this completes the description of the mediator m. we show that ϕm (v) = ϕvcg (v) for every v ∈ v .
let bδ(v,1)(v) = 1 + max{i:s(v,i)≥2}bi(v).
proof of theorem 2. we define a mediator m, which will implement the vcg outcome function in g: for every v ∈ v let mn (v) = b(v), where b(v) is defined as follows: for every player i such that 2 ≤ s(v, i) ≤ m let bi(v) = pvcg s(v,i)−1(v).8 for every i ∈ δ(v, m + 1), bi(v) = pvcg m (v).
however, we still provide a proof since a more simple and intuitive mediator is constructed for this case.
there exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in g. theorem 2 follows from a more general theorem given in the next section.
we can now show: theorem 2. let g be a next-price position auction.
the proof of lemma 1 is given in the full version.
1. pvcg j (b) ≤ b(j+1) for every j ∈ k. 2. pvcg j (b) ≥ pvcg j+1(b) for every j = 1, ..., m − 1 and for every b ∈ b, where for every j, equality holds if and only if b(j+1) = b(j+2) = · · · = b(m+1).
lemma 1. let pvcg be the vcg payment scheme.
our proof makes use of the following technical lemma.
although in the following section we prove a more general result, we present this result first, given the  importance of next-price position auctions in the literature and in practice.
auctions we now show that there exists a valid mediator, which  implements the vcg outcome function in next-price position auctions.
