as such, it assumes the agents are impartial computational entities, not the set of possible buyers as assumed by the pause auction. 
finally, in the computation procuring clock auction [1] the agents are given an  everincreasing percentage of the surplus achieved by their  proposed solution over the current best.
another  interesting approach is given in [8] where the bidding agents prioritize their bids, thus reducing the set of bids that the centralized winner determination algorithm must consider, making that problem easier.
this general idea, which they call the redundancy principle, could also be applied to our problem but it requires the existence of a secure center agent that everyone trusts.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) central server which then checks to make sure results from all pairs agree, otherwise a re-calculation is ordered.
joint conf.
their  mechanism roughly amounts to having each agent calculate the payments for two other agents and give these to a secure 700 the sixth intl.
in [9] the  authors present a distributed mechanism for calculating vcg payments in a mechanism design problem.
this algorithm also fails to converge to a solution for most cases.
the vsa algorithm [3] is another way of performing distributed winner  determination in combinatorial auction but it assumes the bids themselves perform the computation.
one approach is given by the algorithms for distributing the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions presented in [7], but these algorithms assume the  computational entities are the items being sold and thus end up with a different type of distribution.
however, the study of distributed winner determination  algorithms for combinatorial auctions is still relatively new.
we recommend [2] for a good review.
a lot of research has been done on various aspects of  combinatorial auctions.
