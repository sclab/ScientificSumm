cachedpausebid is a caching-based algorithm which explores fewer nodes, since it caches some solutions.
pausebid performs a branch and bound search  completely from scratch every time that it is called.
our algorithms implement a myopic utility maximizing strategy and are guaranteed to find the bidset that maximizes the agent"s utility given the outstanding best bids at a given time.
in this paper we present two algorithms, pausebid and cachedpausebid, which enable agents in a pause  auction to find the bidset that maximizes their utility.
however, it is not concerned with how the bidders determine what they should bid.
pause establishes the rules the participants have to adhere to so that the work is distributed amongst them.
the pause (progressive adaptive user selection  environment) auction [4, 5] is one of a few efforts to distribute the problem of winner determination amongst the bidders.
we believe that distributed solutions to the winner determination problem should be studied as they offer a better fit for some  applications as when, for example, agents do not want to reveal their valuations to the auctioneer.
examples of these algorithms are cass [3], bidtree [11] and cabob [12].
however, most of the existing winner determination algorithms for  combinatorial auctions are centralized, meaning that they require all agents to send their bids to a centralized auctioneer who then determines the winners.
thus,  several approaches and algorithms have been proposed to  address the winner determination problem.
because of their wide applicability, one cannot hope for a general-purpose winner determination algorithm that can efficiently solve every instance of the problem.
the practical applications of combinatorial auctions include: allocation of airport takeoff and landing time slots, procurement of freight transportation services, procurement of public transport services, and industrial procurement [2].
nevertheless, several  algorithms that have a satisfactory performance for problem sizes and structures occurring in practice have been  developed.
this problem, known as the  winner determination problem, is a combinatorial optimization problem and is np-hard [10].
once the bidders place their bids, it is necessary to find the allocation of items to bidders that maximizes the auctioneer"s revenue.
in a  combinatorial auction bidders can place bids on combinations of items, called packages or bidsets, rather than just  individual items.
both the research and practice of combinatorial auctions have grown rapidly in the past ten years.
