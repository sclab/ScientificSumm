1) b is already in b, 2) b is a bid of size ≤ k in which the agent i bids higher than the price for the same items in b. 
that is, each bid b in g must satisfy at least one of the two following conditions.
formally, given that w is the current winning bidset, agent i must find a g∗ i such that r(g∗ i ) ≥ r(w) + and g∗ i = arg max g⊆2b ui(g), (3) where each g is a set of bids that covers all items and ∀b∈g (b ∈ b) or (bagent = i and bvalue > b(bitems ) and size(bitems ) ≤ k), and where b(items) is the value of the bid in b for the set items (if there is no bid for those items it returns zero).
the goal of the bidding agents in the pause auction is to maximize their utility, subject to the constraint that their next set of bids must have a total revenue that is at least bigger than the current revenue, where is the smallest increment allowed in the auction.
if the agent is not winning any items then its utility is zero.
(2) that is, the agent"s utility for a bidset w is the value it receives for the items it wins in w minus the price it must pay for those items.
given an agent"s value function and the current winning bidset w we can calculate the agent"s utility from w as ui(w) = b∈w | bagent=i vi(bitems ) − bvalue .
(1) agent i"s value function is given by vi(s) ∈ where s is a set of items.
this is the set of bids that covers all the items and currently maximizes the revenue, where the revenue of w is given by r(w) = b∈w bvalue .
at any point in the auction, after the first round, there will also be a set w ⊆ b of currently winning bids.
the agents  maintain a set b of the current best bids, one for each set of items of size ≤ k, where k is the current stage.
a bid b is composed of three elements bitems (the set of items the bid is over), bagent (the agent that placed the bid), and bvalue (the value or price of the bid).
