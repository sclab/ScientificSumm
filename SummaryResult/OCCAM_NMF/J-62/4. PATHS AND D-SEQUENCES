hence ∆−→a (−→u ) − ∆−→a (−→u ) = 0. 
noticing both ui−1 and ui belong to dai ∩ dai , we have by proposition 5 ui−1(ai) − ui−1(ai) = δaiai = ui(ai) − ui(ai).
since ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1x i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = u1(a1) + k−1x i=2 (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − uk−1(ak) = u1(b) + k−1x i=2 (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − uk−1(c), ∆−→a (−→u ) − ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1x i=2 ((ui(ai) − ui−1(ai)) − (ui(ai) − ui−1(ai))) = k−1x i=2 ((ui(ai) − ui(ai)) − (ui−1(ai) − ui−1(ai))).
let k = ord(−→u ) = |−→a | = |−→a |.
by proposition 6, δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ) and δ(−→a ) = ∆−→a (−→u ), it suffices to show ∆−→a (−→u ) = ∆−→a (−→u ).
let −→u be a d-sequence in c(−→a ) ∩ c(−→a ).
if c(−→a ) ∩ c(−→a ) = ∅ then δ(−→a ) = δ(−→a ).
lemma 7. let b, c ∈ a and let −→a , −→a ∈ pbc.
ui(ai) − ui(ai+1) = δaiai+1 from proposition 5. therefore, ∆−→a (−→u ) = k−1x i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)) = k−1x i=1 δaiai+1 = δ(−→a ).
by the definition of a compatible pair, ui ∈ dai ∩ dai+1 for i ∈ [k − 1].
let k = ord(−→u ) = |−→a |.
proposition 6. for any compatible pair (−→a , −→u ), ∆−→a (−→u ) = δ(−→a ).
however, path (a, c, d) or path (b, e) is not admissible.
hence (a, b, c, e), (a, b, d, e) and (b, a, d, e) are  admissible paths.
d-sequence (x, w, p, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (b, a, d, e).
d-sequence (v, w, x, y, z) is compatible with both path (a, b, c, e) and path (a, b, d, e); d-sequence (v, w, u, y, z) is compatible with a unique path (a, b, d, e).
to illustrate these definitions, figure 1 gives the  dissection of a domain, a 2-dimensional plane, into five regions da, db, dc, dd, de.
for v, w ∈ d and b, c ∈ a, we define cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ pbc and −→u ∈ svw .
for −→u ∈ c(−→a ) we define ∆−→a (−→u ) = |−→a |−1 x i=1 (ui(ai) − ui(ai+1)).
we say that −→a is admissible if c(−→a ) is nonempty.
we write c(−→a ) for the set of d-sequences −→u that are compatible with −→a .
a compatible pair is a pair (−→a , −→u ) where −→a is a path and −→u is a d-sequence satisfying ord(−→u ) = |−→a | and for each i ∈ [k], both ui−1 and ui belong to dai .
for v, w ∈ d we write svw for the set of (v, w)-sequences.
for a d-sequence −→u , we write ord(u) for the order of −→u .
we call −→u a (u0, uk)-sequence.
, uk) with each ui ∈ d (possibly with repetition).
a d-sequence of order k is a sequence −→u = (u0, .
the δ-weight of path −→a is defined by δ(−→a ) = k−1x i=1 δaiai+1 .
for b, c ∈ a we write pbc for the set of (b, c)-paths and spbc for the set of simple (b, c)-paths.
−→a is simple if the ai"s are distinct.
for a path −→a , we write |−→a | for the size of −→a .
we call −→a an (a1,  ak)path.
, ak) with each ai ∈ a (possibly with repetition).
a path of size k is a sequence −→a = (a1, .
