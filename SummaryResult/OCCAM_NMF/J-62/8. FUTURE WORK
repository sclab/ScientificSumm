what are the most general conditions under which a set d of real matrices is an am-domain?
roberts" theorem says that the unrestricted domain is an am-domain.
turning to parametric representations, let us say a set d of p × a matrices is an am-domain if any truthful  social choice function with domain d is an affine maximizer.
we believe that convexity is the main part of the story, i.e., a wm-domain is, after excluding some exceptional cases, essentially a convex set.
it is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set d of real  matrices is a wm-domain.
typically, the domains of social choice functions considered in  mechanism design are convex, but there are interesting examples with non-convex domains, e.g., combinatorial auctions with unknown single-minded bidders.
in this paper, we showed that for finite a, any convex d is a wm-domain.
let us say that a set d of p × a real valuation matrices is a wm-domain if any social choice function on d  satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful.
as stated in the introduction, the goal underlying the work in this paper is to obtain useful and general  characterizations of truthfulness.
