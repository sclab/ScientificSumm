therefore s a∈a da = d. also, by proposition 5, any point v in da ∩ db satisfies v(a) − v(b) = δab = −δba. 
finally, we restrict the collection of sets {ra : a ∈ a} to the domain d by defining da = ra ∩ d for each a ∈ a. clearly, da is closed and convex, and contains f−1 (a).
thus v(a) − v(b) = δab and by symmetry v(b) − v(a) = δba.
v ∈ ra implies v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab and v ∈ rb implies v(b)−v(a) ≥ δba which, by the nonnegative two-cycle property, implies v(a) − v(b) ≤ δab.

proposition 5. let a, b ∈ a. if v ∈ ra ∩rb then v(a)− v(b) = δab = −δba.
the next proposition  implies that any two of these polyhedra intersect only on their boundary.
ra is a closed polyhedron containing f−1 (a).
in this section, we construct a family of closed convex sets {da : a ∈ a} with disjoint interiors whose union is d and satisfying f−1 (a) ⊆ da for each a ∈ a. let ra = {v : ∀b ∈ a, v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab}.
