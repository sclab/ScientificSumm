here we show the more general result, conjectured by lavi, mu"alem and nisan [6], that weak monotonicity is sufficient for  functions defined on any convex domain.
lavi, mu"alem and nisan [6] proved the sufficiency of weak  monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and gui, muller and vohra [5] proved sufficiency for order-based  domains with range constraints and for domains defined by other special types of linear inequality constraints.
roberts [10] showed that it is sufficient for all  social choice functions whose domain is unrestricted.
weak monotonicity is a simple necessary condition for a  social choice function to be implementable by a truthful  mechanism.
