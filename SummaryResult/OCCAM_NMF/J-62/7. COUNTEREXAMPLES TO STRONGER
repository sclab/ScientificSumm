by lemma 3, this is equivalent to the  condition that hm is untruthful. 
, n} mapping ri to i. property 3 is  equivalent to the condition that the outcome graph ghm has a negative cycle.
, rn} be the set of row vectors of m and let hm be the single player social choice function with domain r(m) and range {1, 2, .
let r(m) = {r1, r2, .
finally, we point out that the third property imposed on the matrix m has the following interpretation.
since δeiej = et i m(ei − ej) = m(i, i) − m(i, j) for any i, j ∈ [k], the weight of the cycle k−1x j=1 δeij eij+1 + δeik ei1 = k−1x j=1 (m(ij , ij ) − m(ij, ij+1)) + (m(ik, ik) − m(ik, i1)) < 0, which completes the proof.
eik ei1 is a negative cycle.
, ik be a  sequence of indices satisfying property 3 of m. we claim ei1 ei2 .
let i1, i2, .
next we show that gf has a negative cycle.
hence the nonnegative two-cycle property holds.
for outcomes λ, µ ∈ a, δλµ +δµλ = λt m(λ−µ)+µt m(µ−λ) = (λ−µ)t m(λ−µ), 292 which is nonnegative since m is positive semidefinite.
we claim that gf satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle  property (w-mon) but has a negative cycle (and hence is not truthful).
for outcomes λ, µ ∈ a, the edge weight δλµ is equal to δλµ = inf{v(λ) − v(µ) : f(v) = λ} = yλ(λ) − yλ(µ) = λt mλ − λt mµ = λt m(λ − µ).
it is easy to see that d is a convex subset of the set of all functions from sn to r. the outcome graph gf is an infinite graph whose vertex set is the outcome set a = sn.
the  nonsingularity of m guarantees that yλ = yµ for λ = µ ∈ sn.
by definition, d must be a set of functions from sn to r. for λ ∈ sn, the domain element yλ : sn −→ r is defined by yλ(α) = λt mα.
the function f maps yλ to λ. next we specify yλ.
, en}, which is the set of vectors in rn with nonnegative coordinates that sum to 1. the range of our social choice function will be the set sn and the domain d will be indexed by sn, that is d = {yλ : λ ∈ sn}, where yλ is defined below.
let sn denote the convex hull of {e1, e2 .
, en denote the standard basis of rn .
, ik ∈ [n] satisfying k−1x j=1 (m(ij, ij) − m(ij , ij+1)) + (m(ik, ik) − m(ik, i1)) < 0. here is an example matrix with n = 3 and (i1, i2, i3) = (1, 2, 3): 0 @ 0 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 0 1 a let e1, e2, .
(3) there are distinct i1, i2, .
(2) m is positive semidefinite.
our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and an n × n matrix m satisfying the following properties: (1) m is non-singular.
we construct a family of single player social choice functions each having a convex domain and an infinite number of outcomes, and satisfying weak monotonicity but not truthfulness.
we now show that the hypothesis of finite range can not be omitted.
since there is a negative cycle δab + δbc + δca = −3, by lemma 3, this is not a truthful choice function.
x and the open line segment zx is assigned outcome a, y and the open line segment xy is assigned outcome b, and z and the open line segment yz is assigned outcome c. clearly, δab = −δba = δbc = −δcb = δca = −δac = −1, w-mon (the nonnegative  twocycle property) holds.
the domain is the boundary of a triangle whose vertices are x = (0, 1, −1), y = (−1, 0, 1) and z = (1, −1, 0).
we present an untruthful single player social choice function with three outcomes a, b, c satisfying w-mon on a path-connected but non-convex domain.
the first example illustrates that convexity can not be omitted.
our examples are single player functions.
we now show that neither of these hypotheses can be omitted.
forms of theorem 4 theorem 4 applies to social choice functions with convex domain and finite range.
