extend f to the function g on dc by defining g(v) = a(v) for v ∈ dc − d and g(v) = f(v) for v ∈ d. it is easy to check that δab(g) = δab(f) for all a, b ∈ a and therefore it suffices to show that the nonnegative two-cycle property for g implies the nonnegative cycle property for g. henceforth we assume d is convex and closed. 
thus for each v ∈ dc − d, there is an a = a(v) ∈ a such that v ∈ (f−1 (a))c .
write dc for the closure of d. since a is finite, dc = ∪a∈a(f−1 (a))c .
we first reduce the theorem to the case that d is closed.
