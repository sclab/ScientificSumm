sections 7 and 8 discusses related work and concludes. 
we obtain a sound and complete axiomatisation of the logic for preference aggregation as well.
as mentioned above, preference aggregation can be seen as a  special case of judgment aggregation, and in section 6 we introduce an alternative interpretation of jal formulae directly in social welfare functions.
we give a sound and complete axiomatisation of the logic in section 5, under the  assumption that the agenda the agents make judgments over is finite.
in section 4 we demonstrate that the logic can express commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules, such as the discursive paradox.
formulae of jal are interpreted directly by, and thus represent properties of, judgment aggregation rules.
in section 3 we introduce the syntax and semantics of jal, and study the complexity of the model checking problem.
in the next section we review the basics of judgment aggregation as well as preference aggregation, and mention some commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules and social welfare  functions.
the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows.
this means, for example, that arrow"s theorem is a formal theorem of jal, i.e., a derivable formula; we thus have a formal proof theory for social choice.
perhaps surprisingly, the  language of jal is syntactically and semantically rather simple; and yet the language is, nevertheless, expressive enough to give elegant and succinct expressions of, e.g., iia, majority voting, the discursive dilemma, condorcet"s paradox and arrow"s theorem.
from these points it might seem that such a language would be rather complex (in particular, these requirements seem to rule out a standard propositional modal logic).
• the preference relation resulting from applying a swf to other preference relations.
• comparison of different preference relations.
• properties of preference relations for different agents, and properties of several different preference relations for the same agent in the same formula.
from this example it seems that a formal language for swfs should be able to express: 566 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas • quantification on several levels: over alternatives; over  preference profiles, i.e., over relations over alternatives  (secondorder quantification); and over agents.
in order to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be able to express, take the example of a potential property of social welfare functions (swfs) called independence of irrelevant  alternatives (iia): given two preference profiles (each consisting of one preference relation for each agent) and two alternatives, if for each agent the two alternatives have the same order in the two preference profiles, then the two alternatives must have the same order in the two preference relations resulting from applying the swf to the two preference profiles, respectively.
the discursive paradox and condorcet"s paradox respectively; and other important properties such as arrow"s theorem.
an agent"s knowledge representation language should be able to  express: common aggregation rules such as majority voting;  commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules and  social welfare functions such as independence; paradoxes commonly used to illustrate judgment aggregation and preference aggregation, viz.
one of the goals of this paper is to investigate the  representational and logical capabilities an agent needs for judgment and preference aggregation; that is, what kind of logical language might be used to represent and reason about judgment aggregation?
of course, a logic is only interesting as long as it is  expressive.
and this is one of the main contributions of this paper: we identify the logical properties of judgment aggregation, and we can compare the logical  properties of different classes of judgment aggregation - and of general judgment aggregation and preference aggregation in particular.
for example, one instance is an axiomatisation, in our language, of all social welfare functions - thus we get a logic of classical preference aggregation as well.
the axiomatisation is parameterised in such a way that we can instantiate it to get a range of different judgment  aggregation logics.
the  formulae of the logic are interpreted as statements about judgment  aggregation rules, and we give a sound and complete axiomatisation of all such rules.
in this paper we present a logic, called judgment aggregation logic (jal), for reasoning about judgment aggregation.
as a special case, judgment aggregation can be seen to subsume preference aggregation [5].
a variety of judgment aggregation rules have been developed to this end.
the recently emerging field of judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective, and discusses how, given a consistent set of logical formulae for each agent, representing the agent"s beliefs or judgments, we can aggregate these to a  single consistent set of formulae.
preference aggregation - combining individuals" preference relations over some set of alternatives into a preference relation which  represents the joint preferences of the group by so-called social  welfare functions - has been extensively studied in social choice theory [2].
for example, an agent may need to reason about majority voting in a group he is a member of.
in this paper, we are interested in knowledge representation  formalisms for systems in which agents need to aggregate their  preferences, judgments, beliefs, etc.
