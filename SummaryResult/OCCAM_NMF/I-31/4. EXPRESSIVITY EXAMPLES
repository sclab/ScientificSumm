proposition 1 is a logical statement of a variant of the well-known discursive dilemma: if three agents are voting on propositions p, q and p → q, proposition-wise majority voting might not yield a consistent result. 
but that contradicts the fact that f(γ) is required to be consistent.
since f(γ) is complete, ¬q ∈ f(γ).
in other words, p ∈ f(γ), p → q ∈ f(γ) and q f(γ).
we have that f, γ, p |=l (σ ↔ g⊆σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i) for any p , so f, γ, p |=l σ ↔ g⊆σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i. because f, γ, p |=l 1 ∧ 2, it follows that f, γ, p |=l σ. in a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=l σ and f, γ, q |=l ¬σ.

and a3 = {¬p, p → q, ¬q, .
}, a2 = {p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, .
let γ be the  judgment profile γ = a1, a2, a3 where a1 = {p, p → q, q, .
and there exists an aggregation rule f over a such that f |=l (σ ↔ g⊆σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i).
assume the opposite, e.g., that a = {p, p → q, q, ¬p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, .
|=l (( mv) → ⊥) when there are at least three agents and the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication.
proposition 1 (discursive paradox).
assume that the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication (i.e., a contains p, q, p → q for some p, q ∈ l(l)).
however, we have the following in our logic.
, an) ⇔ |{i : p ∈ ai}| > |{i : p ai}| f |= mv exactly iff f has the above property for all judgment  profiles and propositions.
, an : p ∈ f(a1, .
4.1 the discursive paradox as illustrated in example 1, the following formula expresses proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p mv = σ ↔ g⊆σ,|g|> n 2 i∈g i (4) i.e., the following property of a jar f and admissible profile a1, .
unanimity can be expressed as follows: una = ((1 ∧ · · · ∧ n) → σ) (3) lemma 3. f |=l una iff f has the property una.
independence can be expressed as follows: ind = o∈o ((o ∧ σ) → (o → σ)) (2) lemma 2. f |=l ind iff f has the property ind.
non-dictatorship can be expressed as follows: nd = i∈σ ¬(σ ↔ i) (1) lemma 1. f |=l nd iff f has the property nd1.
