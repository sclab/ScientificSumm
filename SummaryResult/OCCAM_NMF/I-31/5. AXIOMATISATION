an example of a derivation of the less complicated (valid) property (i ∧ j) is shown in table 3. 
a counter example is the fact that the following is valid: σ (5) - no matter what preferences the agents have, the jar will always make some judgment - while this is not valid: (σ ∧ i) (6) - the jar will not necessarily make the same judgments as agent i. so, for example, we have that the discursive paradox is provable in jal(l): jal(l) (( mv) → ⊥).
however, uniform  substitution, a principle of all normal modal logics (cf., e.g., [3]), does not hold.
we point out that jal has all the axioms taut, k, t, 4, 5 and the rules mp and nec of the modal logic s5.
finally, the function f is a table of all tuples hp, o(p), σ for which (hp ∧ o(o) ∧ σ) is contained in some set in tables.
furthermore, the γ is obtained, for every agent i, by finding all q for which (hq ∧ i) is currently true.
now, we extract an aggregation function f and pairs γ, p as follows: for every δ ∈ tables, find a conjunction hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. there will be exactly one such p. this defines the p we are looking for.
it is then easy to verify that, for every δ ∈ tables, and every formula ϕ, δ |= ϕ iff ϕ ∈ δ, where |= here means truth in the ordinary modal logic sense when the set of states is taken to be tables.
let δ0 be a mcs containing ψ. we now define the set tables = {δ0} ∪ {δ1, δ2 | (r δ0δ1 and r δ1δ2) or (r δ0δ1 and r δ1δ2)} every δ ∈ tables can be conceived as a pair γ, p, since every δ contains a unique (hq ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ) for every hq and a unique hp.
both relations are equivalences (due to taut-5), and moreover, when r δ1δ2 and r δ2δ3 then for some δ2, also r δ1δ2 and r δ2δ3 (because of axiom comm).
similarly for r with respect to .
let d be the set of all  maximal consistent sets δ. we don"t want all of those: it might well be that ψ requires σ to be in a certain way, which is incompatible with some δ"s. we define two accessibility relations in the standard way: r δ1δ2 iff for all ψ: ψ ∈ δ1 ⇒ ψ ∈ δ2.
in fact, our  axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of f. to be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. it is easy to see that table descriptions are mutually exclusive, and, moreover, we can derive τ∈t τ, where t is the set of all table descriptions.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) jal table for a consistent formula ψ as follows.
joint conf.
for completeness (we  focus on the main idea here and leave out trivial details), we build a 570 the sixth intl.
soundness is straightforward.
theorem 3. if the agenda is finite, we have that for any formula ψ ∈ l(σ, a), jal(l) ψ iff |=l ψ. proof.
we use jal(l) to denote derivability in jal(l).
closure guarantees that agents behave  consistently with respect to consequence in the logic l. mp and nec are standard.
comm says that everything that is true for an arbitrary profile and item, is also true for an arbitrary item and profile.
axiom c says that for any agenda item for which it is possible to have opposing opinions, every possible outcome for that item should be achievable.
the axioms taut − 5 are well familiar from modal logic: they directly reflect the unrestricted quantification in the truth definition of and .
note that from agenda, csjs and cpjs we derive the scheme x ∧ ¬x, which says that everybody should at least express one opinion in favour of something, and against something.
axiom cpjs corresponds to the requirement that judgment sets are complete.
note that a conjunction hp ∧ x reads: item p is on the agenda, and x is in favour of it, or x judges it true.
axiom agenda says that every agenda item will appear on the table, whereas once says that every item of the agenda only appears on the table once.
axiom atmost says that there is at most one item on the table at a time, and atleast says that we always have an item on the table.
the first 5 axioms represent properties of a table and of judgment sets.
l is the underlying logic.
p, pi, q range over the agenda a; φ,ψ,ψi over l(σ, a); x over {σ, i : i ∈ σ}; over { , }; i, j over σ; o over the set of outcomes o. hp means hq when p = ¬q for some q, otherwise it means h¬p.
pn l q infer (hp1 ∧ x) ∧ · · · ∧ (hpn ∧ x) → (hq → x) ∧ (hq → ¬x) closure from ϕ → ψ and ϕ infer ψ mp from ψ infer ψ nec table 2: the logic jal(l) for the language l(σ, a).
¬(hp ∧ hq) if p q atmost p∈a hp atleast hp p ∈ a agenda (hp ∧ ϕ) → (hp → ϕ) once (hp ∧ x) ∨ (hp ∧ x) cpjs all instantiations of propositional tautologies taut (ψ1 → ψ2) → ( ψ1 → ψ2) k ψ → ψ t ψ → ψ 4 ¬ ψ → ¬ ψ 5 ( i ∧ ¬j) → o∈o o c ψ ↔ ψ (comm) from p1, .
given an underlying logic l, a finite agenda a over l, and a set of agents σ, judgment aggregation logic (jal(l), or just jal when l is understood) for the language l(σ, a), is defined in table 2.
