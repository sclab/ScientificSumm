in future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness and consistency requirements of judgment sets, and try to  characterise these in the logical language, as properties of general  judgment sets, instead. 
thus our framework sheds light on the  differences between the logical principles behind general judgment aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation on the other.
the axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical arrovian  preference aggregation.
jal provides a proof theory, in which results such as those mentioned above can be derived3 .
it is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple language provides these capabilities.
we argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about  judgment aggregation.
jal is expressive: it can express judgment aggregation rules such as majority voting; complicated properties such as independence; and important results such as the discursive paradox, arrow"s theorem and condorcet"s paradox.
we have presented a sound and complete logic jal for  representing and reasoning about judgment aggregation.
