as these examples show and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to provide a  framework that can accommodate both independent and  heterogeneous learning agents and this can be regarded as the main contribution of our work. 
the animals system [10] was used to simulate  multistrategy learning by combining two or more learning  techniques (represented by heterogeneous agents) in order to overcome weaknesses in the individual algorithms, yet it was also a strictly cooperative system.
however, all agents in this system were identical and the system was strictly cooperative.
agents were able to critique each others" hypotheses until agreement was reached.
the male system [19] was a very early multiagent  learning system in which agents used a blackboard approach to communicate their hypotheses.
papyrus [3] is a system that provides a markup language for meta-description of data, hypotheses and intermediate results and allows for an exchange of all this information among different nodes, however with a strictly cooperative goal of distributing the load for massively distributed data mining tasks.
[11] is a step in the right direction in terms of revealing only partial information about one"s learning process as it deals with limited information sharing in distributed  clustering.
a number of approaches for sharing learning data [18] have also been proposed: grecu and becker [12] suggest an exchange of learning samples among agents, and ghosh et al.
the same is true of [22, 23] which both present market-based mechanisms for aggregating the output of multiple learning agents, even though these  approaches consider more interesting interaction mechanisms among learners.
[13] which is also specifically designed for a  particular learning algorithm.
an  agentbased method for integrating distributed cluster analysis processes using density estimation is presented by klusch et al.
many approaches rely heavily on a homogeneity  assumption: plaza and ontanon [15] suggest methods for  agentbased intelligent reuse of cases in case-based reasoning but is only applicable to societies of homogeneous learners (and coined towards a specific learning method).
the difference between this kind of collaborative  agentbased learning systems [16] and our own framework is that these approaches assume a joint learning goal that is pursued collaboratively by all agents.
a similar example is the work of weiss [24], where groups of  classifier agents learn to organise their activity so as to optimise global system behaviour.
[6] which is based on a distributed support-vector machine  approach where agents incrementally join their datasets  together according to a fixed distributed algorithm.
a typical example for this type of system is the one suggested by caragea et al.
very often, approaches that are allegedly agent-based completely disregard agent autonomy and prescribe local decision-making procedures a priori.
we have already mentioned work on distributed  (nonagent) machine learning and data mining in the  introductory chapter, so in this section we shall restrict ourselves to approaches that are more closely related to our outlook on distributed learning systems.
