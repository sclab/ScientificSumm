the results provide insights into the predictive performance of information markets, and the relative merits of selecting among various opinion  pooling methods.
in screening pooled expert predictions, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function;  weighting expert assessments according to their past performance does not improve accuracy of pooled predictions; and  logarithmic aggregation functions offer bolder predictions than linear aggregation functions.
our results show that, at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as pooled expert assessments.
prices in information markets are used to  derive market predictions.
we combine assessments of multiple experts via  linear and logarithmic aggregation functions to form pooled predictions.
we  leverage a unique data source of almost 2000 people"s subjective probability judgments on 2003 us national football league games and compare with the market probabilities given by two different information markets on exactly the same events.
