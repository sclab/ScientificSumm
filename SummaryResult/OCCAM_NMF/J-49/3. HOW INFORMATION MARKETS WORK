in practice,  conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information  market.
spann and skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 
wolfers and zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.
many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in  information markets by designing and trading different securities.
it predicts the expected value of a  future outcome.
this kind of security is what wolfers and zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.
when the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.
its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.
it is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).
the above security is a winner-takes-all contract.
observing the security price p before the game, we can derive pr(patriots win), which is the market participants" collective prediction about how likely it is that new england will win the game.
thus, p = pr(patriots win) × 100 + [1 − pr(patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if new england defeats carolina and pr(patriots win) is the probability that new england will win the game.
assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.
the time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.
the security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.
for example, if we want to predict which team will win the nfl game between new england and carolina, an  information market can trade a security $100 if new england defeats carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if new england wins the game; $0 otherwise.
this idea gives rise to information markets.
thus, when associating the value of a  security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.
empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large  extent [25, 27, 35].
the market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants" consensus expectation about the future value of the security.
the efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all  available information.
hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940"s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed  information among market participants.
much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market  hypothesis [15].
