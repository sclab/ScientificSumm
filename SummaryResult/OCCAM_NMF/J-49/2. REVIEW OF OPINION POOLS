behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their  opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and can"t guarantee convergence or  repeatability.
however, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to  apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often  impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional  independence of experts.
bayesian  approaches are nicely based on the normative bayesian  framework.
in addition, several impossibility results (e.g., genest [21]) show that no aggregation  function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.
but they don"t have a normative basis to choose weights.
axiomatic  approaches are easy to use.
each approach has its pros and cons.
some other  behavioral methods, such as the nominal group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.
experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.
typically, this method and its variants do not allow open  discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.
one of the best known behavioral approaches is the delphi technique [28].
the important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further  interaction won"t change their opinions.
behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational  behavior.
the resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.
this decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its  priors over the event and opinions according to bayes rule.
bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.
winkler [39] and morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of bayesian aggregation methods.
other axiomatic  pooling methods often are extensions of linop [22], logop [23], or both [13].
using logop, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.
using linop, the aggregate probability  distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual  probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert i"s probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability  distribution, wi"s are weights for experts, which are usually  nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.
two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (linop) and the logarithmic opinion pool (logop).
these  pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.
axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions,  expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.
mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic  approaches and bayesian approaches.
genest and zidek [24] and french [20] provide  comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.
they are combined through various  mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability  distribution.
in mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as  subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an  uncertain event.
clemen and winkler [12] classify opinion pooling  methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches and behavioral approaches.
