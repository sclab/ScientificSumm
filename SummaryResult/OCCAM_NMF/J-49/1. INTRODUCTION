data sets and our analysis methods are described in section 4. we present results and analysis in section 5, followed by conclusions in section 6. 
section 3 introduces the basics of information markets.
section 2 reviews popular opinion pooling methods.
the remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
in  selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy of opinion pools; and logop offers bolder predictions than linop.
our results show that at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as our carefully selected opinion pools.
in terms of prediction accuracy, we compare two  information markets with several linear and logarithmic  opinion pools (linop and logop) at predicting the results of nfl games.
this paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) as an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better  understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) in screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.
the  comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to choose the most appropriate method for their needs.
since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and  selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market  participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective.
al [36], in which the authors compare two information markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions.
however, information markets have not been  calibrated against opinion pools, except for servan-schreiber et.
prices in hsx and fx have been found to give as accurate or more  accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts [33, 34, 37].
the political election markets at iem predict the election outcomes better than polls [16, 17, 18, 19].
previous research in general shows that information markets are remarkably accurate.
despite the popularity of information markets, one of the most important questions to ask is: how accurately can  information markets predict?
the foresight exchange (fx) [4] allows traders to wager play money on unresolved scientific questions or other claims of public  interest, and newsfutures.com"s world news exchange [1] has 58 popular sports and financial betting markets, also grounded in a play-money currency.
tradesports.com [7], a real-money betting  exchange registered in ireland, hosts markets for sports,  political, entertainment, and financial events.
the  hollywood stock exchange (hsx) [3] is a virtual (play-money) exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office proceeds of new movies, and the outcomes of entertainment awards, etc.
the iowa electronic markets (iem) [2] are real-money futures markets to predict  economic and political events such as elections.
such markets are becoming very popular.
the security price before the game reflects the consensus expectation of market traders about the  probability of new england winning the game.
otherwise, it pays off nothing.
for example, in an information market to predict the result of a us professional national football league (nfl) game, say new england vs carolina, the security pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if and only if new england wins the game.
to form the predictions,  information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of events.
information markets (sometimes called  prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are  markets designed for aggregating information and making  predictions about future events.
with the fast growth of the internet, information markets have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical  forecasting tool.
these belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in  statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12].
since experts are not generally in agreement, many belief aggregation methods have been  proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a  single prediction.
one widely used non-statistical method is to elicit opinions from experts.
when these conditions can not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on  judgmental information about the future event could be better choices.
statistical approaches require not only the existence of enough  historical data but also that past data contains valuable  information about the future event.
for decades, scientists have been developing and exploring various forecasting methods, which can be roughly divided into statistical and non-statistical approaches.
forecasting is a ubiquitous endeavor in human societies.
