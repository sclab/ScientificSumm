in this context, we are particularly interested in appropriate  mechanisms to detect and respond to lying by interrogating suspicious agents and forcing them to commit themselves to (sets of) mental states publicly while sanctioning them when these are inconsistent with their actions. 
currently, we are working on fully-fledged specifications of dynamic semantics for more complex languages and on extending our approach to mentalistic semantics where we view statements about mental states as commitments  regarding the rational implications of these mental states (a simple example for this is that an agent commits itself to dropping an ostensible intention that it is claiming to  maintain if that intention turns out to be unachievable).
we discussed the properties of our framework showing how it can be used as a powerful communication-inherent mechanism for rewarding and sanctioning agent behaviour in open systems without compromising agent autonomy,  discussed its integration with agents" planning processes,  complexity issues, and presented a list of desiderata for the  design of acls with such semantics.
thereby, our focus was on simplicity and on providing mechanisms for tracking semantic evolution in a  down-toearth, algorithmic fashion to ensure applicability to many different agent designs.
we then defined dynamic  semantics as state transition systems over different semantic states that can be viewed as different versions of acl  semantics in the traditional sense, and can be easily associated with a planning-based view of reasoning about  communication.
based on a common  framework of commitment-based semantics, we presented a notion of grounding for commitments based on notions of compliant and expected behaviour.
this paper introduces dynamic semantics for acls as a method for dealing with some fundamental problems of agent communication in open systems, the simple  underlying idea being that different courses of agent behaviour can give rise to different interpretations of meaning of the  messages exchanged among agents.
