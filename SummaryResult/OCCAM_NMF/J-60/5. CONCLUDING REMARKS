it would be interesting to identify these cases.
• it seems that some social choice goals cannot be  implemented if each player is at least 1/n-malicious (where n is the number of players).
incentives for  information propagation should be considered as well (e.g., for p2p networks for file sharing).
as a result, the probability that the environment is informed decreases, and  selfish agents would not cooperate.
however, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs.
in our examples we choose p such that the maintenance cost over time is negligible.
• mechanisms for information propagation and  maintenance.
the challenge is to find more realistic scenarios in which the partial informational  assumption is applicable.
some issues for future work include: • as we have seen, the implementation issue in p-informed environments is straightforward - it is easy to construct incentive compatible mechanisms even for  non-singleparameter cases.
we then described some  mechanisms using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.
in this paper we have seen a new partial informational assumption, and we have demonstrated its suitability to networks in which computational agents can easily collect and distribute information.
