we believe that these two directions could be  rewarding given the theoretical and experimental evidence in this paper. 
much of the recent work in ranking systems sometimes ignores correlations between document labels and scores.
second, our results could affect the design of minimal test collection algorithms.
retrieval algorithms designed to consider spatial autocorrelation will conform to the cluster hypothesis and improve performance.
first, our results could affect retrieval algorithm design.
our results suggest two conclusions.
our  experiments also demonstrate the limits of the usefulness of our predictors when information from multiple runs is provided.
second, when provided retrievals from other systems, our extended methods demonstrate  competitive performance with state of the art baselines.
to our knowledge, this is the first large scale examination of zero-judgment, single-retrieval  performance prediction.
we have demonstrated this improvement for many, diverse settings.
this performance, combined with a simple implementation, makes our predictors, in particular, very  attractive.
first, when making  predictions in the absence of retrievals from other systems, our predictors demonstrate robust, strong correlations with  average precision.
we consider two cases.
we have presented a new method for predicting the  performance of a retrieval ranking without any relevance  judgments.
