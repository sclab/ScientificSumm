our proof for the correctness indicator function was  primarily inspired by [12]. 
the main idea is to either stop the traversal of the inverted lists early, or to shrink the lists by pruning postings from the lists [14, 4, 11, 8].
there has been a great body of work on top-k result calculation.
since our work does not assume a particular form of ranking function, it is complementary to this body of work.
similarly, there are a number of works that measure the quality of the documents,  typically as captured through link-based analysis [17, 28, 26].
query-dependent relevance can be calculated in a variety of ways (see [3, 30]).
in general, however, the rankings are based on query-dependent relevance and  queryindependent document quality.
the exact ranking functions employed by current search engines are closely guarded secrets.
this thread of work is also orthogonal to ours because a caching scheme may operate on top of our p-index in order to minimize the answer  computation cost.
search engines use various methods of caching as a means of  reducing the cost associated with queries [18, 19, 21, 31].
our work essentially extends [1, 2, 4, 7, 20, 27, 31] by proposing mechanisms for providing the correctness guarantee to the computed top-k results.
[32] presents a generic framework for computing approximate top-k answers with some probabilistic bounds on the quality of results.
however, [1, 5, 7, 27] do not consider any query-independent quality (such as  pagerank) in the ranking function.
the works in [1, 5, 7, 20, 27] are the most related to ours, as they describe pruning techniques based on the idea of keeping the  postings that contribute the most in the final ranking.
the pruning algorithms that we have presented in this paper are independent of the partitioning scheme used.
experimental studies and analyses of various partitioning schemes for an inverted index are presented in [6, 23, 33].
[3, 30] provide a good overview of inverted indexing in web search engines and ir systems.
