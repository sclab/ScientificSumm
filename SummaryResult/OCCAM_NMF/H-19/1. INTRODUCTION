our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 
• we come up with an unsupervised event detection  algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.
• we propose a simple and effective mixture  densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts.
specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) hh (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) hl (high power and low periodicity): important  periodic events, 3) lh (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) ll (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) sw (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of ll comprising stopwords, which contains no information.
1.1 contributions this paper has three main contributions: • to the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.
in this  paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner.
based on these observations, we can  either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.
a periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic  features; 2) representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) an important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) a feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.
to summarize, we postulate that: 1) an event is described by its  representative features.
in particular, it indicates the significance of mining correlating features for detecting corresponding events.
if a large number of them can be uncovered, it could significantly aid tdt tasks.
these two examples are but the tip of the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden in a news stream like reuters.
other observations drawn from figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of april is much longer than easter, which suggests that april may exist in other events during the same period; 2) unaudited has a higher average dfidf value than ended, which indicates unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event.
these two words actually originated from the same periodic event, net income-loss reports, which are released quarterly by  publicly listed companies.
exhibit similar behaviour over periods of 3 months.
another example is given by figure 1(b), where both the words unaudited and ended 1 reuters corpus is the default dataset for all examples.
in this  example, the hidden event easter feast is a typical important aperiodic event over 1-year data.
from the plot of their normalized dfidf in figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (easter feast).
as an illustrative example, consider the correlation  between the words easter and april from the reuters  corpus1 .
0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 easter april (a) aperiodic event 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 unaudited ended (b) periodic event figure 1: feature correlation (dfidf:time)  between a) easter and april b) unaudited and ended.
to evaluate our method, we subsequently propose an unsupervised event detection algorithm for news streams.
in particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection,  borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing:  identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral analysis.
of these features, often only a small number are expected to be useful.
however, in many predictive event detection tasks (i.e., retrospective event detection), there is a vast set of potential features only for a fixed set of observations (i.e., the obvious bursts).
previous work like [9] has attempted to  reconstruct an event with its representative features.
thus in this paper, we look at news stories and  feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series word signal.
instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and tfidf), a  fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in tdt.
as further proof, portals like yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.
the ineffectiveness of current tdt  technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the  industryleading google news alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].
unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of tdt solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].
in fact, the topic detection and tracking (tdt) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.
manually monitoring all of them for important events has become difficult or practically impossible.
there are more than 4,000 online news sources in the world.
