nevertheless, we believe our simple and effective method will be useful for all tdt  practitioners, and will be especially useful for the initial exploratory analysis of news streams. 
[9], and swan and allan [18].
future work includes evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news stream, and comparing our model against the closest  equivalent methods, which currently are limited to the methods of kleinberg [12] (which can only detect certain type of bursty events depending on parameter settings), fung et al.
although we have not made any benchmark comparison against another approach, simply because there is no  previous work in the addressed problem.
we also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to  detect both aperiodic and periodic events, which was successful in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real news stream.
to address the real event detection problem, a simple and effective mixture density-based approach was used to identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods.
the key idea of our work lies in the observations that (a)periodic events have (a)periodic representative features and (un)important events have (in)active representative  features, differentiated by their power spectrums and time  periods.
for the first time in the area of tdt, we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic events.
by  considering the word document frequencies in both time and  frequency domains, we were able to derive many new  characteristics about news streams that were previously unknown, e.g., the different distributions of stopwords during  weekdays and weekends.
this paper took a whole new perspective of analyzing feature trajectories as time domain signals.
