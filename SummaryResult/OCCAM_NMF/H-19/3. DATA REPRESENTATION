, yf (t)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized dfidf score2 yf (t) = dff (t) n(t) × log( n dff ), where dff (t) is the number of documents (local df)  containing feature f at day t, dff is the total number of  documents (global df) containing feature f over t, n(t) is the number of documents for day t, and n is the total number of documents over t. 
(feature trajectory) the trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), .
the representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: definition 3.
likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to  reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly  correlated features are representative.
3.2 representative features intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a hurricane genre event.
note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given t, and may be invalid for any other t > t. for example, the event christmas feast is aperiodic for t ≤ 365 but periodic for t ≥ 730.
(periodic event) if events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity p ≤ t/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.
definition 2.
(aperiodic event) an event is aperiodic within t if it only happens once.
definition 1.
we thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.
3.1 event periodicity classification within t, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., tony blair elected as prime minister of u.k., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.
let t be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and f represents the complete word feature space in the classical static vector space model (vsm).
