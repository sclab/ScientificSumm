note that our ug algorithm only requires one data-dependant parameter, the boundary between high and low power spectrum, to be set once, and this parameter can be easily estimated using the hs algorithm (algorithm 1). 
furthermore, trivial events only containing year/month features (i.e., an event only containing 1 feature aug could be identified over a  1year news stream) could be removed, although such events will have inherent high cost and should already be ranked very low.

the cost in eq.
(3) the burst analysis for event e is exactly the same as the feature trajectory.
(2) the underlying event e (associated with the burst of fi) can be represented by ri as y(e) = fj ∈ri sfj fu∈ri sfu yfj .
specifically, we need to find a subset ri of hh that minimizes the following cost function: c(ri) = kl(ri) d(ri) fj ∈ri sfj , ri ⊂ hh.
the set of features similar to fi can then collectively describe an event.
given bursty feature fi ∈ hh, the goal is to find highly correlated  features from hh.
all of them share the same algorithm.
6.2 unsupervised greedy event detection we use features from hh to detect important aperiodic events, features from lh to detect less-reported/unimportant aperiodic events, and features from hl to detect periodic events.
(set df overlap) d(r) = min ∀fi,fj ∈r d(fi, fj).
definition 9.
accordingly, the df overlap among a set of features r is also defined.
(feature df overlap) d(fi, fj ) = |mi∩mj| min(|mi|,|mj|) .
definition 8.
we define the degree of document overlap  between two features fi and fj as follows.
intuitively, the higher the |mi ∩ mj |, the more likelty that fi and fj will be highly correlated.
given two features fi and fj , the overlapping document set containing both features is mi ∩ mj .
document overlap let mi be the set of all documents containing feature fi.
(set"s similarity)kl(r) = max ∀fi,fj ∈r kl(fi, fj ).

1 is employed to compute the similarity between two periodic features, next, we define the overal similarity among a set of  features r using the maximum inter-feature kl-divergence value as follows.
the same discrete kl-divergence  formula of eq.
further, the similarity between two  aperiodic features can be computed using a closed form of the kl-divergence [16].
(1) since kl-divergence is not symmetric, we define the  similarity between between fi and fj as the maximum of kl(fi|fj ) and kl(fj |fi).
(feature similarity) kl(fi, fj ) is given by max(kl(fi|fj ), kl(fj |fi)), where kl(fi|fj ) = t t=1 f(yfi (t)|θfi )log f(yfi (t)|θfi ) f(yfj (t)|θfj ) .
definition 6.
measuring feature distribution similarity we measure the similarity between two features fi and fj using discrete kl-divergence defined as follows.
2. fi and fj have a high document overlap.
6.1 feature correlation if two features fi and fj are representative of the same event, they must satisfy the following necessary conditions: 1. fi and fj are identically distributed: yfi ∼ yfj .
after identifying and modeling bursts for all features, the next task is to paint a picture of the event with a potential set of representative features.
