bee"s faster-than-real-time simulation may enable us to identify appropriate probing actions, greatly increasing the  effectiveness of intelligence efforts. 
such probing is an important intelligence  technique.
one way to address these concerns is to probe the real world, perturbing it in ways that would stimulate distinct  behaviors from entities whose psychological state is otherwise  indistinguishable.
if the environment then shifts to one under which the different internal states lead to different behaviors, using the previously chosen internal state will yield inaccurate  predictions.
as long as the environment stays in this state, our predictions will be accurate, whichever of the internal states we assign to the agent.
if the environment in the recent past is one that confounds such distinct internal states, we will be unable to distinguish them.
several different internal states might be consistent with a given observed behavior under one set of environmental  conditions, but might yield distinct behaviors under other conditions.
the mapping between an agent"s psychological (cognitive and emotional) state and its outward behavior is not one-to-one.
we expect to extend the set of emotions and supporting  dispositions that bee can detect.
our initial limited repertoire of emotions is a small subset of those that have been distinguished by psychologists, and that might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior.
potential applications of interest include computer games, business strategy, and sensor fusion.
with such a change in inputs, bee could be applied more widely than its current domain of adversarial reasoning in  urban warfare.
the  basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as well, requiring much less additional engineering than other more traditional ways of reasoning about how different  knowledge sources come together in impacting an agent"s behavior.
the various inputs being integrated by the bee are only an  example of the kinds of information that can be handled.
the bee architecture lends itself to extension in several promising directions.
state variables that do not impact behavior, while invisible to a behavior-based  analysis, are irrelevant to a behavioral prediction.
if our purpose of fitting agents is to predict their subsequent behavior, the limitation is much less serious.
this limitation is serious if our purpose is to understand the entity"s internal state for its own sake.
it cannot fit variables that the agent does not manifest externally, since the basis for the evolutionary cycle is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simulated agent with that of the real entity.
bee can only model internal state variables that impact the agent"s external behavior.
in realistic wargames, the system successfully detects  deliberately played emotions and makes reasonable predictions about the entities" future behaviors.
by evolving agents in this rich environment, we can fit their internal state to their observed  behavior.
this simulation integrates knowledge of threat regions, a cognitive analysis of the agent"s beliefs, desires, and intentions, a model of the agent"s emotional disposition and state, and the dynamics of interactions with the environment.
bee performs this task using a faster-than-real-time simulation of swarming agents, coordinated through digital pheromones.
in many domains, it is important to reason from an entity"s observed behavior to an estimate of its internal state, and then to extrapolate that estimate to predict the entity"s future behavior.
