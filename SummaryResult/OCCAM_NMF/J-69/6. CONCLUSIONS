finally, colluders and traitors can be kept in check via subjective reputations and short-term  history, respectively.
furthermore, cooperation can be  established even in the presence of zero-cost identities through the use of an adaptive policy towards strangers.
we find that the adoption of shared history and discriminating server selection techniques can mitigate the challenge of few repeat transactions that arises due to large population size, high turnover and asymmetry of interest.
addressing the  challenges imposed by p2p systems, including large populations, high turnover, asymmetry of interest and zero-cost identities, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon the reciprocative decision function, to support cooperative  behavior and improve overall system performance.
in this paper we take a game theoretic approach to the  problem of cooperation in peer-to-peer networks.
