bittorrent [7] uses tit-for-tat as a method for resource allocation, where a user"s upload rate dictates his download rate. 
also, these mechanisms are still vulnerable to zero-cost identities and collusion.
these mechanisms can be circumvented by a skilled user or by a competing company releasing a compatible client without the incentive restrictions.
some commercial file sharing clients [1] [2] provide incentive mechanisms which are enforced by making it difficult for the user to modify the source code.
[6] and [9] show that whitewashing and collusion can have dire consequences for peer-to-peer systems and are difficult to prevent in a fully decentralized system.
using a  theoretical model, they demonstrate that such a system can converge to cooperation only for sufficiently low turnover rates, which our  results confirm.
friedman and resnick [13] consider the  problem of zero-cost identities in online environments and find that in such systems punishing all newcomers is inevitable.
the unique challenges imposed by peer-to-peer systems inspired additional body of work [5] [37], mainly in the context of packet forwarding in wireless ad-hoc routing [8] [27] [30] [35], and file sharing [15] [31].
in this context, demonstrating the superiority of a cooperative strategy (as in the case of our work) is consistent with the objective of incentivizing the desired behavior among selfish players.
more recently, damd has been also studied in dynamic environments [38].
[10] and [11] are examples of applying damd to bgp routing and multicast cost sharing.
distributed algorithmic  mechanism design seeks solutions within this framework that are both fully distributed and computationally tractable [12].
it asks how to design a game in which the behavior of strategic players results in the socially desired outcome.
mechanism design is the inverse of game theory.
in recent years, researchers have used economic mechanism  design theory to tackle the cooperation problem in internet  applications.
as a result, an image player is either vulnerable to partial defectors (if the  threshold is set too low) or does not cooperate with other image players (if the threshold is set too high).
players using image cooperate with players whose global count of  cooperations minus defections exceeds some threshold.
nowak and sigmund [28] introduce the image strategy and  demonstrate its ability to establish cooperation among players despite few repeat transactions by the employment of shared history.
our model assumes growth follows local learning rather than  evolutionary dynamics [14], and also allows for more kinds of attacks.
in a simulation  environment with many repeated games, persistent identities, and no  collusion, axelrod [4] shows that the tit-for-tat strategy dominates.
the prisoners" dilemma model provides a  natural framework to study the effectiveness of different strategies in establishing cooperation among players.
the problem has been extensively studied adopting a game  theoretic approach.
a well-known phenomenon in this context is the tragedy of the commons [18] where resources are under-provisioned due to selfish users who free-ride on the  system"s resources, and is especially common in large networks [29] [3].
previous work has examined the incentive problem as applied to societies in general and more recently to internet applications and peer-to-peer systems in particular.
