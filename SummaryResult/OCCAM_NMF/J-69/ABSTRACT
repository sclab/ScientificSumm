through simulation, we show that these techniques can drive a system of strategic users to nearly optimal levels of cooperation.
these techniques are fully distributed and include: discriminating server selection,  maxflowbased subjective reputation, and adaptive stranger policies.
to tackle these challenges we model the p2p system using the generalized prisoner"s dilemma (gpd), and propose the reciprocative decision function as the  basis of a family of incentives techniques.
what makes this problem  particularly difficult is the unique set of challenges that p2p systems pose: large populations, high turnover, asymmetry of interest,  collusion, zero-cost identities, and traitors.
lack of cooperation (free riding) is one of the key problems that confronts today"s p2p systems.
