finally, the authors wish to explore applying the metrics collection concepts described in this paper to a more general and reusable context management system [20]. 
future work will also involve the evaluation of a broad range of adaptation scenarios on the mobjex framework to quantity the gains that can be made via adaptation through object mobility and thus demonstrate in practise, the efficacy of the solution described in this paper.
furthermore, such a temporal history could also facilitate intelligent decisions regarding the collection of metrics since for example a metric that is known to be largely constant need not be frequently measured.
one such approach could be based on maintaining metrics history in order to determine the temporal behaviour of metrics and thus make more intelligent and conservative decisions regarding whether a change in a particular metric is likely to be of interest to the adaptation engine and should thus serve as a basis for notification for inclusion in the next metrics push.
while the potentially efficacy of this approach was tested using simple criteria, given the flexibility of the approach we believe there are many opportunities to significantly reduce collection overhead through the use of more sophisticated criteria.
a key feature of the solution was the specification of multiple configurable criteria to control the propagation of metrics through the system, thereby reducing collection overhead.
in addition, further testing provided an initial indication of the characteristics of application objects (based on method execution time) that would be good candidates for adaptation using the worst case implementation of the proposed metrics collection strategy.
controlled lab studies were conducted to determine worst case performance, as well as show the reduction in collection overhead when applying simple collection criteria.
given the challenges of developing mobile applications that run in dynamic/heterogeneous environments, and the subsequent interest in application adaptation, this paper has proposed and implemented an online metrics collection strategy to assist such adaptation using a mobile object framework and supporting middleware.
