categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information search and retrieval]: search process, relevance feedback.
we report results of a large-scale experimental evaluation that show substantial improvements over published implicit feedback interpretation methods.
we generalize our approach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough, which results in higher preference prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone.
we show that our model of clickthrough interpretation improves prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art clickthrough methods.
our key insight to improving robustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from the expected noisy user behavior.
accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking, click spam detection, web search personalization, and other tasks.
we present a real-world study of modeling the behavior of web search users to predict web search result preferences.
evaluating user preferences of web search results is crucial for search engine development, deployment, and maintenance.
