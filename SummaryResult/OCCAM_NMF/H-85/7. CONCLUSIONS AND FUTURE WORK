the predicted relevance preferences can be used for automatic relevance evaluation and tuning, for deploying search in new settings, and ultimately for improving the overall web search experience. 
our techniques allow us to automatically predict relevance preferences for web search results with accuracy greater than the previously published methods.
as we showed in this paper, using the wisdom of crowds can give us accurate interpretation of user interactions even in the inherently noisy web search setting.
furthermore, some predicted preferences may be more valuable than others, and we plan to investigate different metrics to capture the utility of the predicted preferences.
query distributions also change over time, and it would be productive to investigate how that affects the predictive ability of these models.
hence, clustering queries and learning different predictive models for each query type is a promising research direction.
for example, queries with divergent access patterns (e.g., for ambiguous queries with multiple meanings) may result in behavior inconsistent with the model learned for all queries.
while our techniques perform well on average, our assumptions about clickthrough distributions (and learning the user behavior models) may not hold equally well for all queries.
alternatively, our models could be used directly to detect anomalies in user behavior - either due to abuse or to operational problems with the search engine.
for example, our automatically derived behavior models could be trained on examples of search abuse or click spam behavior instead of relevance labels.
in addition, our work has many potential applications including click spam detection, search abuse detection, personalization, and domain-specific ranking.
a natural application of our preference prediction models is to improve web search ranking [1].
our general userbehavior method would be able to adapt to these changes by automatically learning to map new behavior patterns to explicit relevance ratings.
for example, the user behavior model on intranet search may be different from the web search behavior.
another benefit of automatically learning to interpret user behavior is that such methods can adapt to changing conditions and changing user profiles.
furthermore, we showed that automatically learning to interpret user behavior results in substantially better performance than the human-designed ad-hoc clickthrough interpretation strategies.
by considering the complete search experience after the initial query and click, we demonstrated prediction accuracy far exceeding that of interpreting only the limited clickthrough information.
we also presented a general model for interpreting post-search user behavior that incorporates clickthrough, browsing, and query features.
our methods" predictions of relevance preferences are substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art search result ranking that does not consider user interactions.
our methods result in clickthrough interpretation substantially more accurate than previously published results not specifically designed for web search scenarios.
we introduced new, robust, probabilistic techniques for interpreting clickthrough evidence by aggregating across users and queries.
we showed that our robust models result in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques.
our paper is the first, to our knowledge, to interpret  postsearch user behavior to estimate user preferences in a real web search setting.
