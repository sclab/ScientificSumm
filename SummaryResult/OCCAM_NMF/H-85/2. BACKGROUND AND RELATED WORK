in this paper, we build on previous research to develop robust user behavior interpretation models for the real web search setting. 
unfortunately, the extent to which existing research applies to real-world web search is unclear.
a more comprehensive overview of studies of implicit measures is described in kelly and teevan [12].
by performing eye tracking studies and correlating predictions of their strategies with explicit ratings, the authors showed that it is possible to accurately interpret clickthrough events in a controlled, laboratory setting.
[10] presented an empirical evaluation of interpreting clickthrough evidence.
more recently, joachims et al.
joachims [9] developed valuable insights into the collection of implicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.
they found that clickthrough was the most important individual variable but that predictive accuracy could be improved by using additional variables, notably dwell time on a page.
they built an instrumented browser to collect data and then developed bayesian models to relate implicit measures and explicit relevance judgments for both individual queries and search sessions.
[7] explored the relationship between implicit and explicit measures in web search.
fox et al.
found that the time spent on a page, the amount of scrolling on a page, and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong positive relationship with explicit interest, while individual scrolling methods and mouse-clicks were not correlated with explicit interest.
claypool et al.
they developed a custom browser called the curious browser to gather data, in a computer lab, about implicit interest indicators and to probe for explicit judgments of web pages visited.
[6] studied how several implicit measures related to the interests of the user.
while the results were promising, the sample size was small and the implicit measures were not tested against explicit judgments of user interest.
the authors hypothesized correlations between a high degree of page activity and a user"s interest.
goecks and shavlik [8] approximated human labels by collecting a set of page activity measures while users browsed the world wide web.
more recently, oard and kim [16] presented a framework for characterizing observable user behaviors using two dimensions-the underlying purpose of the observed behavior and the scope of the item being acted upon.
oard and kim [15] studied whether implicit feedback could substitute for explicit ratings in recommender systems.
[13] showed that reading time was a strong predictor of user interest in their grouplens system.
konstan et al.
morita and shinoda [14] studied the amount of time that users spent reading usenet news articles and found that reading time could predict a user"s interest levels.
in these studies, both reading time and explicit ratings of interest are collected.
several research groups have evaluated the relationship between implicit measures and user interest.
reducing the dependence on explicit human judgments by using implicit relevance feedback has been an active topic of research.
human annotators rate a set of pages for a query according to perceived relevance, creating the gold standard against which different ranking algorithms can be evaluated.
current search engines are commonly tuned on human relevance judgments.
a  state-ofthe-art search engine may use hundreds of features to describe a candidate page, employing sophisticated algorithms to rank pages based on these features.
the most common approaches in the context of the web use both the similarity of the query to the page content, and the overall quality of a page [3, 20].
ranking search results is a fundamental problem in information retrieval.
