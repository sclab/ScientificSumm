our userbehavior strategy achieves recall of over 0.43 with precision of over 0.67 (with much higher precision at lower recall levels), substantially outperforms the current search engine preference ranking and all other implicit feedback interpretation methods. 
furthermore, by considering the comprehensive userbehavior features that model user interactions after the search and beyond the initial click, we can achieve substantially higher precision and recall than considering clickthrough alone.
nevertheless, our cd+cdiff clickthrough strategy outperforms most recent state-of-the-art results by a large margin (0.72 precision for cd+cdiff vs. 0.64 for sa+n) at the highest recall level of sa+n.
because of the skewed distribution of user clicks our clickthrough-only strategies have high precision, but low recall (i.e., do not attempt to predict relevance of many search results).
we showed that by intelligently aggregating user clickthroughs across queries and users, we can achieve higher accuracy on predicting user preferences.
we now briefly summarize our experimental results.
as expected, recall of both strategies improves quickly with more days of interaction data examined.
we fixed minimum precision for both strategies at 0.7 as a point substantially higher than the baseline (0.625).
figure 6.4 reports the recall of cd+cdiff and userbehavior strategies for varying amounts of training data collected over time.
as a consequence, the recall of current is high (0.627) at the expense of lower precision as another dimension of acquiring training data we consider the learning curve with respect to amount (days) of training data available.
in contrast, the current search engine always makes a prediction for every result for a given query.
our techniques often do not make relevance predictions for search results (i.e., if no interaction data is available for the lower-ranked results), consequently maintaining higher precision at the expense of recall.

for queries with sufficient clicks, cd+cdiff exhibits precision comparable with browse at lower recall.
similarly, the userbehavior strategy performs better for queries with 10 and 20 clicks, although the improvement is less dramatic than for cd+cdiff.
this indicates that accuracy will improve as more user interaction histories become available, and more queries from the q1 set will have comprehensive interaction histories.
not surprisingly, cd+cdiff improves with more clicks.
figure 6.3 reports recall-precision curves for the cd+cdiff and userbehavior methods for different test query sets with at least 1 click (q1), 10 clicks (q10) and 20 clicks (q20) available per query.
we consider the effects of having sufficient interaction data available for a query before proposing a re-ranking of results for that query.
our clickthrough and user behavior interpretation strategies rely on extensive user interaction data.
for example, the clickthrough-trained classifier achieves 0.67 precision at 0.42 recall vs. the maximum recall of 0.14 achieved by the cd+cdiff strategy.
interestingly, the ranker trained over clickthrough-only features achieves substantially higher recall and precision than human-designed clickthrough-interpretation strategies described earlier.

applying different machine learning methods for combining classifier predictions may increase performance of using all features for all recall values.
furthermore, browsing features alone have higher precision (with lower maximum recall achieved) than considering all of the features in our userbehavior model.
interestingly, query-text alone has low accuracy (only marginally better than random).
figure 6.2 reports precision vs. recall for each feature group.
to further analyze the value of different dimensions of implicit feedback modeled by the userbehavior strategy, we consider each group of features in isolation.
furthermore, browse is able to achieve high recall (as high as 0.43) while maintaining precision (0.67) significantly higher than the baseline ranking.
browse exhibits precision of above 0.7 at recall of 0.16, significantly outperforming our baseline and clickthrough-only strategies.
incorporating post-search navigation history in addition to clickthroughs (browsing features) results in the highest recall and precision among all methods compared.
but first, we consider the best performing strategy, userbehavior.
however, even the cd+cdiff clickthrough interpretation strategy can be improved upon by automatically learning to interpret the aggregated clickthrough evidence.
clearly, aggregating and intelligently interpreting clickthroughs, results in significant gain for realistic web search, than previously described strategies.
interestingly, cdiff alone exhibits precision equal to sa (0.627) at the same recall at 0.08. in contrast, by combining cd and cdiff strategies (cd+cdiff method) we achieve the best performance of all clickthrough-based strategies, exhibiting precision of above 0.66 for recall values up to 0.14, and higher at lower recall levels.

in contrast, our clickthrough distribution-based techniques cd and cd+cdiff exhibit somewhat higher precision than sa and sa+n (0.648 and 0.717 at recall of 0.08, maximum achieved by sa or sa+n).
furthermore, there is no mechanism to do recall-precision trade-off with sa and sa+n, as they do not provide prediction confidence.
the results indicate that previous click interpretation strategies, sa and sa+n perform suboptimally in this setting, exhibiting precision 0.627 and 0.638 respectively.
figure 6.1 shows the recall-precision results over the q1 query set (section 5.2).
we now turn to experimental evaluation of predicting relevance preference of web search results.
