interestingly, this efficiency is not obtained at the price of additional assumptions (such as fifo channels). 
the resulting protocols, that implement a vector clock system, are particularly efficient as far as the size of the timestamp carried by each message is concerned.
last but not least, it is interesting to note that if one is not interested in tracking the immediate predecessor events, the protocols presented in the paper can be simplified by  suppressing the ipi booleans vectors (but keeping the boolean matrices mi).
interestingly, it has also been shown that the efficiency of the protocols (measured in terms of the size of the control information that is not piggybacked by an application  message) depends on the pattern defined by the communication events and the relevant events.
three of them have been described and analyzed with simulation experiments.
according to the way the general condition is implemented,  different ipt protocols can be obtained.
in that sense, this family defines message size-efficient ipt protocols.
the  family is defined by a general condition that allows application messages to piggyback control information whose size can be smaller than n (the number of processes).
it has presented a family of protocols that provide each relevant event with a timestamp that exactly identify its immediate predecessors.
this paper has addressed an important causality-related distributed computing problem, namely, the immediate  predecessors tracking problem.
