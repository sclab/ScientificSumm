our experiments demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of using our energy-efficient storage architecture in multi-tier sensor networks.
we implement tsar in a two-tier sensor testbed comprising  stargatebased proxies and mote-based sensors.
at the sensor tier, tsar supports energy-aware adaptive  summarization that can trade off the cost of transmitting metadata to the proxies against the overhead of false hits resulting from querying a coarse-grain  index.
at the proxy tier, tsar employs a novel multi-resolution ordered distributed index structure, the interval skip graph, for efficiently supporting spatio-temporal and value queries.
we present tsar, a fundamentally different storage architecture that  envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local archiving at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
we argue that existing storage systems are designed primarily for flat hierarchies of homogeneous sensor nodes and do not fully exploit the multi-tier nature of emerging sensor networks, where an application can comprise tens of tethered proxies, each managing tens to hundreds of untethered sensors.
archival storage of sensor data is necessary for applications that query, mine, and analyze such data for interesting features and trends.
