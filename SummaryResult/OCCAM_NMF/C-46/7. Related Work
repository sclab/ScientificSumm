while this paper focuses on building an ordered index structure for range queries, we will explore the use of other index structures for alternate queries over sensor data.
dhts [25] can be used for indexing events based on their type, quad-tree variants such as  rtrees [12] can be used for optimizing spatial searches, and k-d trees [2] can be used for multi-attribute search.
in addition to storage and indexing techniques specific to sensor networks, many distributed, peer-to-peer and spatio-temporal index structures are relevant to our work.
thus complex operations such as indexing and managing metadata are performed at the proxies, while storage at the sensor remains simple.
tsar provides a  better match between resource requirements of storage and indexing and the availability of resources at different tiers.
while these approaches advocate in-network indexing for sensor networks, we believe that indexing is a task that is far too  complicated to be performed at the remote sensor nodes since it involves maintaining significant state and large tables.
distributed index of features in  sensornets (difs [11]) and multi-dimensional range queries in sensor networks (dim [18]) extend the data-centric storage approach to provide spatially distributed hierarchies of indexes to data.
dcs constructs a distributed structure that groups events together  spatially by their named type.
one such scheme is dcs [26], which provides a hash function for mapping from event name to location.
recent research has seen a growing body of work on data indexing schemes for sensor  networks[26][11][18].
local storage with in-network indexing approaches address this  issue by constructing indexes using frameworks such as geographic hash tables [24] and quad trees [9].
these schemes had the drawback that for queries that are not  geographically scoped, search cost (o(n) for a network of n nodes) may be prohibitive in large networks with frequent queries.
: find temperature in the south-west quadrant), and if not, the query is flooded throughout the network.
the directed diffusion substrate routes queries to specific locations 49 if the query has geographic information embedded in it (e.g.
sources publish the events that they detect, and sinks with interest in specific events can subscribe to these events.
early work on sensor networks such as directed diffusion [17] assumes a system where all useful sensor data was stored locally at each sensor, and spatially scoped queries are routed using geographic co-ordinates to locations where the data is stored.
in order to efficiently access a distributed sensor store, an index needs to be constructed of the data.
the rise platform [21] being developed as part of the node project at ucr addresses the issues of hardware platform support for large amounts of storage in remote sensor nodes, but not the indexing and querying of this data.
in contrast, tsar addresses the problem of archival storage in two-tier systems where sufficient resources can be placed at the edge sensors.
multi-resolution storage [9] is intended for in-network storage and search in systems where there is significant data in comparison to storage resources.
both these systems focus on local storage, whereas our focus is both on storage at the remote sensors as well as providing a unified view of distributed data across all such local archives.
elf [7] is a  logstructured file system for local storage on flash memory that  provides load leveling and matchbox is a simple file system that is packaged with the tinyos distribution [14].
the problem of archival storage of sensor data has received limited attention in sensor network literature.
while our work addresses both problems jointly, much prior work has considered them in isolation.
in this section, we review prior work on storage and indexing techniques for sensor networks.
