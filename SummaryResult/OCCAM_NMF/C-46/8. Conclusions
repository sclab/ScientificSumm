our experimental  evaluation of tsar demonstrated the benefits and feasibility of  employing our energy-efficient low-latency distributed storage architecture in multi-tier sensor networks.
we  implemented tsar in a two-tier sensor testbed comprising  stargatebased proxies and mote-based sensors.
at the sensor tier, tsar supports energy-aware adaptive summarization that can trade-off the energy cost of  transmitting metadata to the proxies against the overhead of false hits  resulting from querying a coarser resolution index structure.
at the proxy tier, tsar employs a novel multi-resolution ordered distributed index structure, the sparse  interval skip graph, for efficiently supporting spatio-temporal and range queries.
we presented the design of tsar, a fundamentally different storage architecture that envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local storage at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
in this paper, we argued that existing sensor storage systems are designed primarily for flat hierarchies of homogeneous sensor nodes and do not fully exploit the multi-tier nature of emerging  sensor networks.
