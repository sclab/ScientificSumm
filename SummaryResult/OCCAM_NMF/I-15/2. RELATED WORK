given the success of this method, we shall study how the addition of logical paths and gradual evolution of the network topology can further increase the effectiveness of the proposed method.

the gradual creation of overlay networks via re-wiring, shortcuts creation [1,8,16] or clustering of peers [17,9] are tuning approaches that differ fundamentally from the one proposed here: through local interactions, we aim at tuning the network for efficient information provision by gathering routing information gradually, as queries are being propagated in the network and 1 general research in peer-to-peer systems concentrates either on network topologies or on distribution of documents: approaches do not aim to optimize advertising, and search mostly requires common keys for nodes and their contents.
however, this is done as time passes and while agents" receive requests from their peers.
according to our approach, agents advertise selectively their information provision abilities about specific topics to their neighbours with similar information interests (and only to these).
it is on the receiver"s side to decide whether it shall accept or not an advertisement, based on the similarity between expertise descriptions.
in [5,6] peers, using a common ontology, advertise their expertise, which is being exploited for the formation of a semantic overlay network: queries are propagated in this network depending on their similarity with peers" expertise.
here, agents actively advertise their information provision abilities based on the assessed interests of their peers: this results in a much lower number of messages per query than those reported in remindin".
this results in a tuning process where the overall recall increases over time, while the number of messages per query remains about the same.
remindin" [10] peers gather information concerning the queries that have been answered successfully by other peers, so as to subsequently select peers to forward requests to: this is a lazy learning approach that does not involve advertisement of peer information provision abilities.
a major question concerning information searching is what information has to be shared between peers, when, and what adjustments have to be made so as queries to be routed to trustworthy information sources in the most effective and efficient way.
considering research in semantic peer-to-peer systems1 , most of the approaches exploit what can be loosely stated a routing index.
dealing with static networks, they focus on minimizing processing and communication bottlenecks: although we deal with concurrent search sessions, their work is orthogonal to ours, which may be further extended towards incorporating such features in the future.
based on their work on peer-to-peer systems, h.zhand and v.lesser in [19] study concurrent search sessions.
however, it is expected that this will complicate re-organization.
moreover, although during  reorganization and retrieval they measure the similarity of content between agents, a more fine grained approach is needed that would allow agents to measure similarities of information items or sub-collections of information items.
although this work aims at tuning a network for efficient information provision (through  reorganization), it does not demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with respect to this issue.
clusters are being exploited during information retrieval using a knn approach and a gradient search scheme.
then, the system reorganizes by forming clusters of agents with similar content.
initially, agents build their views using the models of their neighbours.
exploiting the models of other agents in the network, agents construct their view of the network which is being used for forming routing decisions.
viewing information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems from a multi-agent system perspective, the approach proposed in [18] is based on a language model of agents" documents collection.
however, this approach can not scale to large and dynamic networks, as it would be highly inefficient for each agent to compute and determine its potential needs and information provision abilities given its potential interaction with 100s of other agents.
this approach is based on the specification of agents as providers and needers: this is done by a plan-based  precomputation of information needs and provision abilities of agents.
proactive communication has been proposed in [17] as a result of a dynamic decision theoretic determination of communication strategies.
as it will be shown in section 5, our experiments show that although these approaches can handle information sharing in dynamic networks, they require a larger amount of messages in comparison to the approach proposed here and can not tune the network for efficient information sharing.
in accordance to this approach, in [12,13,14], information sharing is considered only for static networks and self-tuning of networks is not demonstrated.
the proposed method requires a high volume of computations that authors aim to reduce by restricting its application to static logical teams of associated agents.
in [11] authors provide a mathematical framework for routing tokens, providing also an approximation to solving the original problem in case of independent agents" activities.
token based approaches are promising for scaling coordination and therefore information provision and sharing to large-scale systems effectively.
last, in contrast to their approach where agents broadcast messages, here agents decide not only when to communicate, but to whom to send a message too.
third, they consider that transitions and observations made by agents are independent, which, as already discussed, is not true in the general case.
second, the solution is approximated using a myopic algorithm, but authors do not demonstrate how  suboptimal are the solutions computed (something we neither do), given their interest to the optimal solution.
their work differs in the one reported here in the following aspects: first, it aims at optimizing communication, while the goal here is to tune the network for effective information sharing, reducing communication and increasing system"s benefit.
they approximate the solution using a myopic algorithm.
considering independent activities and observations, authors in [4] propose a decision-theoretic solution treating standard action and information exchange as explicit choices that the decision maker must make.
furthermore, the probabilities of transitions can be dependent too; something that increases the complexity of the problem: for example, when an agent sends a query to another agent, then this may affect the state of the latter, as far as the assessed interests of the former are concerned.
furthermore, agents" observations can not be assumed independent, as one agent"s actions can affect the observations of others: for instance, when one agent joins/leaves the system, then this may affect other agents" assessment of neighbours" information provision abilities.
however, in a large-scale dynamic system with decentralized control it is very hard for agents to possess accurate partial views of the environment, and it is even more hard for agents to possess a global view of the environment.
the computation of an optimal control policy is simple given that global states can be factored, that the probability of transitions and observations are independent, the observations combined determine the global state of the system and the reward function can be easily defined as the sum of local reward functions [3].
optimal solutions can only be approximated by means of heuristics, by relaxations of the original problem or by centralized solutions.
in the general case, decentralized control of  largescale dynamic systems of cooperative agents is a hard problem.
information provision and sharing can be considered to be a decentralized partially-observable markov decision process [3,4,11,14].
