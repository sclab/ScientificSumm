agents in the network must share/acquire the necessary information while searching, increasing the benefit and efficiency gradually, as more queries are posed. 
this must be done seamlessly to searching: i.e.
the routing and profiling tuples detailed in section 4), so as to route queries and further share information in the most efficient way.
‘tuning" the network requires agents to acquire the necessary information about acquaintances" interests and information provision abilities (i.e.
the of the system is measured by the number of messages needed for searching and updating the indexes and profiles maintained.
the of the system is the ratio of information pieces retrieved to the number of information pieces requested.
the problem that this article deals with is as follows: given a network of agents and a set of queries , agents must retrieve the pieces of information requested by queries, in concurrent search sessions, and further ‘tune" the network so as to answer future similar queries in the more effective and efficient way, increasing the benefit of the system and reducing the communication messages required.
in case this limit is exceeded and the corresponding number of information pieces have not been found, then the query is considered unfulfilled however, even in this case, a (possibly high) percentage of the requested pieces of information may have been found.
each query is represented by a tuple where is the unique identity of the query is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of information pieces requested, is the specific category to which these pieces must belong, is a path in the network of agents through which the query has been propagated (initially it contains the originator of the query and each agent appends its id in the before propagating the query), and is a positive integer that specifies the maximum number of hops that the query can reach.
finally, it is assumed that there is a set of queries .
the set of concepts is denoted by it is assumed that the sets of items in agents" local repositories are non-overlapping.
it is assumed that agents in the network share the same ontology, but each agent has a set of information items in its local repository, which are classified under the concepts of its expertise.
indices and profile models are described in detail in section 4. ontology concepts represent categories that classify the information pieces available.
its acquaintance agents) such that ( ) the set of acquaintances of is denoted by each agent maintains (a) an ontology that represents categories of information, (b) indices of information pieces available to its local database and to other agents, and (c) a profile model for some of its acquaintances.
the neighbourhood of an agent includes all the one-hop away agents (i.e.
the network of agents is modelled as a graph =( , ), where is the set of agents and is a set of bidirectional edges denoted as  nonordered pairs ( , ).
let { } be the set of agents in the system.
