• under the graphical interpretation of the  representation, we develop an algorithm for determining the whether a payoff vector is in the core and the emptiness of the core in time exponential only in the treewidth of the graph. 
• we develop an algorithm for computing the shapley value of coalitional games under this representation that runs in time linear in the size of the input.
we believe that the representation is also simple and intuitive.
1.4 summary of our contributions • we develop the marginal contribution networks  representation, a fully expressive representation scheme whose size scales according to the complexity of the interactions among the agents.
we will give a more detailed review of these papers in section 2.2 after covering the technical background.
our work extends and generalizes the representation schemes in [3, 4] through decomposing the game into a set of rules that assign marginal contributions to groups of agents.
in [3], conitzer and sandholm developed a fully expressive representation scheme based on  decomposition.
they developed a compact representation scheme for such games, but again the representation is not fully  expressive either.
in [2], conitzer and sandholm looked into the problem of determining the emptiness of the core in superadditive games.
while the representation is compact, it is not fully  expressive.
in [4], deng and papadimitriou focused on the complexity of different solution concepts on coalitional games defined on graphs.
1.3 previous work the question of coalitional game representation has only been sparsely explored in the past [2, 3, 4].
by  having a general representation and efficient algorithms that go with it, the representation will be useful as a prototyping tool for studying new economic situations.
for some problems, however, there may not be efficient algorithms for customized representations.
for example, for the recommendation system game, a highly compact  representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products, and let the algorithms that operate on the representation to compute the values of coalitions  appropriately.
for any given class of games, one may be able to develop a representation scheme that is tailored and more compact than a general scheme.
unfortunately, given that the number of degrees of  freedom of coalitional games is o(2n ), not all games can be  represented concisely using a single scheme due to information theoretic constraints.
the goal of this paper is to develop a representation scheme that has properties close to the ideal representation.
the ideal representation should be fully expressive, i.e., it should be able to represent any coalitional games, use as little space as possible, have efficient algorithms for  computation, and be easy to use.
simplicity: the ease of use of the representation by users of the system.
efficiency: the efficiency of the algorithms we can develop for the representation.
conciseness: the space requirement of the representation.
expressivity: the breadth of the class of coalitional games covered by the representation.
we believe that the quality of a representation scheme should be evaluated by four criteria.
therefore, it is critical to find good representation schemes for coalitional games.
for the two applications described, the number of agents in the  system can easily exceed a hundred; this na¨ıve approach will not be scalable to such problems.
the na¨ıve solution is to enumerate the payoffs to each set of agents, therefore requiring space 193 exponential in the number of agents in the game.
1.2 evaluation criteria for coalitional game representation to capture the coalitional games described above and  perform computations on them, we must first find a  representation for these games.
a similar problem,  combinatorial coalition formation, has previously been studied in [8].
the resulting game can be analyzed using coalitional game  theory, and we can answer questions such as the stability of coalitions, and how to fairly divide the benefits among the participating manufacturers.
depending on the set of suppliers and how much from each supplier each coalition purchases, we can assign payoffs to the coalitions depending on the discount it receives.
the decrease in communication costs will let manufacturers find others  interested in the same set of suppliers cheaper, and facilitates formation of coalitions to bargain with the suppliers.
suppose that each manufacturer purchases his raw materials from some set of suppliers, and that the suppliers offer higher discount with more purchases.
the increased use of the internet as a medium for conducting business has decreased the costs for companies to coordinate their actions, and therefore  coalitional game is a good model for studying the supply chain problem.
as another example, consider the economics behind  supply chain formation.
these values can then be used to  determine how much each agent should receive for participating in the system.
compute the value of the  private information of the agents is worth to the system using the solution concept of the shapley value (definition can be found in section 2).
given this coalitional game setting, kleinberg et al.
the payoffs to groups of agents are the total number of  distinct items known by its members.
in their model, each individual knows about a certain set of items, is interested in learning about all items, and benefits from finding out about them.
use coalitional games to study recommendation systems.
in [7], kleinberg et al.
1.1 coalitional games and e-commerce coalitional games have appeared in the context of  e-commerce.
these choices of primitives are in contrast to those of non-cooperative games, of which agents are modeled independently, and their payoffs depend critically on the actions chosen by the other agents.
this payoff is intended to reflect the payoff the group of agents can secure for themselves regardless of the actions of the agents not in the group.
as an abstraction, coalitional games assign a payoff to each group of agents in the game.
coalitional games capture these opportunities of  coordination by explicitly modeling the ability of the agents to take joint actions as primitives.
agents can often benefit by coordinating their actions.
