the augmented  semantics can simplify the representation by specifying when rules cannot be applied together. 
currently, to represent such situations, we have to specify rules to cancel out the effects of applications of different rules.
for example, if agent i in the system stands for coal, we can either use it as fuel for a power plant or as input to a steel mill for making steel, but not for both at the same time.
this is useful in situations where a certain agent represents a type of exhaustible resource, and therefore rules that depend on the presence of the agent should not apply simultaneously.
another idea to extend mc-nets is to augment the  semantics to allow constructs that specify certain rules cannot be applied simultaneously.
with the use of functions, the space required can be reduced to o(1).
without the use of functions, the space needed to describe mdrs among n agents in mc-nets is o(n).
the use of functions will allow  concise description of marginal diminishing returns (mdrs).
more concretely, we can specify the value of a rule as dependent on the number of agents of each relevant class.
along the line of exploiting symmetry, as the agents within the same class are symmetric with respect to each other, we can extend the idea above by allowing functional description of marginal contributions.
this will also address the problem of unpleasing assymetric representations of symmetric games in our representation.
the concept of  symmetry is prevalent in games, and the use of classes of agents will allow us to capture symmetry naturally and concisely.
one direction to increase the conciseness of mc-nets is to allow the definition of  equivalent classes of agents, similar to the idea of extending bayes nets to probabilistic relational models.
finally, we would like to end with some ideas for  extending the work in this paper.
we believe that with a better understanding of the  relationships among these related areas, we may be able to develop more efficient representations and algorithms for coalitional games.
the question of the representation power of different  patterns is also related to boolean expression complexity [12].
the or-bid  language, for example, is strongly related to superadditivity.
the representational issues faced in coalitional games are closely related to the problem of expressing  valuations in combinatorial auctions [5, 10].
first apply these idea to games theory by introducing a representation scheme derived from bayes net to represent non-cooperative games [6].
in fact, kearns et al.
they both address the issue of of conciseness of representation by using the combinatorial structure of weighted hypergraphs.
for example, the graphical interpretation of mc-nets is closely related to markov random fields (mrfs) of the bayes nets community.
the work in this paper is related to a number of areas in computer science, especially in artificial intelligence.
other than the algorithm for core-non-emptiness in [4] under the restriction of non-negative edge weights, and that in [2] for  superadditive games when the value of the grand coalition is given, we are not aware of any explicit description of algorithms for core-related problems in the literature.
we have also extended the algorithm to solve core-non-emptiness.
while core-membership for mc-nets is conp-complete, we have developed an algorithm for  coremembership that runs in time exponential only in the treewidth of the agent graph.
we have also developed an efficient  algorithm for the computation of the shapley values for this representation.
our focus on general representation is in contrast to the approach taken in [3, 4].
we have developed a fully expressive representation scheme for coalitional games of which the size depends on the  complexity of the interactions among the agents.
