the gtr procedure outputs a mechanism which depends on a set x âŠ‚ n. another interesting question is what the quality of approximation is when x is chosen randomly from n before valuations are declared.
although we know that it is impossible to have ir, ic and bb in an efficient mechanism it would be interesting to have an upper bound on the approximation to welfare achievable in an ir, ic and bb mechanism.
we also leave open the question of upper bounds for the quality of approximation of welfare.
the question of the quality of welfare approximation both in general and in class domains that are not procurement class domains is an important and interesting open  question.
the gtr procedure improves on existing results such as homogeneous double-sided auctions, distributed markets, and supply chains, and solves several open problems such as distributed markets with strategic transportation edges and bounded paths, combinatorial double-sided auctions with bounded size procurements sets, and combinatorial  doublesided auctions with a bounded number of procurement sets.
the output  mechanisms achieves welfare that is close to optimal for a wide range of domains.
gtr  accepts an ir and ic mechanism as an input and outputs mechanisms that are ir, ic and bb.
in this paper we presented a general solution procedure called the generalized trade reduction (gtr).
