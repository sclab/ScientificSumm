furthermore, our solution provides  budget balanced mechanisms for several open problems such as combinatorial double-sided auctions and distributed  markets with strategic transportation edges.
in particular, our results improve on existing  solutions for problems such as double sided markets with  homogenous goods, distributed markets and several kinds of supply chains.
we bound the welfare achieved by our procedure for a wide range of  domains.
in this paper we provide a procedure called a  generalized trade reduction (gtr) for single-value players, which given an ir and ic mechanism, outputs a mechanism which is ir, ic and bb with a loss of welfare.
there have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by  trading welfare for bb, e.g., in domains such as double-sided auctions[13], distributed markets[3] and supply chain  problems[2, 4].
it is well known [15] that it is impossible for a mechanism to maximize social welfare whilst also being ir, ic, and bb.
when designing a mechanism there are several desirable properties to maintain such as incentive compatibility (ic), individual rationality (ir), and budget balance (bb).
