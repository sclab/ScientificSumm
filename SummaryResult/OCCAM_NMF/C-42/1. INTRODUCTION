application description and the need for grid-enabling enkf methodology is provided in section 3. the implementation details and merits of our approach are discussed in section 4. conclusions are provided in section 5. finally, observations and lessons learned are documented in section 6. 
section 2 provides an overview of the tigre environment and capabilities.
within the energy exploration strategic application area, we have grid-enabled the ensemble kalman filter (enkf) [7] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the tigre environment and the gridway [8] metascheduler.
the overall goal of tigre is to support local, campus and regional user interests and offer avenues to connect with national grid projects such as open science grid [5], and teragrid [6].
vision of the tigre project is to foster interdisciplinary and intercampus collaborations, identify novel approaches to extend academic-government-private partnerships, and become a competitive model for external funding opportunities.
these are bioscience and medicine, energy exploration and air quality modeling.
the secondary goal is to demonstrate the tigre capabilities to enhance research and educational opportunities in strategic application areas of interest to the state of texas.
the primary goal of tigre is to design and deploy state-of-the-art grid middleware that enables integration of computing systems, storage systems and databases, visualization laboratories and displays, and even instruments and sensors across texas.
the goal of hipcat is to support advanced computational technologies to enhance research, development, and educational activities.
tigre is a project of the high performance computing across texas (hipcat) [4] consortium.
the purpose of tigre is to create a higher education grid to sustain and extend research and educational opportunities across texas.
the texas internet grid for research and education (tigre) [2,3] is a state funded cyberinfrastructure development project carried out by five (rice, a&m, ttu, uh and ut austin) major university systems - collectively called tigre institutions.
its importance stems from the fact that ground breaking research in strategic application areas such as bioscience and medicine, energy exploration and environmental modeling involve strong interdisciplinary components and often require intercampus collaborations and computational capabilities beyond institutional limitations.
grid computing [1] is an emerging collaborative computing paradigm to extend institution/organization specific high performance computing (hpc) capabilities greatly beyond local resources.
