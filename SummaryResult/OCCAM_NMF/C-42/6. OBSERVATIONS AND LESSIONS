these efforts may result in increased collaborative research, educational opportunities, and workforce development through graduate/faculty research programs across tigre institutions. 
efforts are under way to involve more schools in this effort.
in summary, our efforts through tigre in grid-enabling the enkf data assimilation methodology showed substantial promise in engaging petroleum engineering researchers through intercampus collaborations.
this approach also helps users to match their applications and abilities grids can offer.
it is our observation that training and outreach programs that compare and contrast the grid and cluster computing environments would be a suitable approach for enhancing user participation in grid computing.
since grid computing is still an emerging technology, and it spans over several administrative domains, grid computing is still premature especially in terms of the level of qos although, it offers better data security standards compared to commodity clusters.
also, there is a steep learning curve in grid computing compared to the conventional cluster computing.
with respect to qos, application researchers expect cluster level qos with grid environments.
since the reservoir modeling research involves proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial efforts initially in educating the application researchers on the ability of grid services in supporting the industry standard data security through role- and privilege-based access using x.509 standard.
the main issues are industry standard data security and qos comparable to cluster computing.
learned the grid-enabling efforts for enkf application have provided ample opportunities to gather insights on the visibility and promise of grid computing environments for application development and support.
