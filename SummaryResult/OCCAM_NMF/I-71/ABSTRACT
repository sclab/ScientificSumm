we resort to channel theory to carry out the formalisation.
it hence makes the situation in which the alignment occurs explicit in the model.
in this paper, we present a formal model for a semantic alignment procedure that incrementally aligns differing conceptualisations of two or more agents relative to their respective perception of the environment or domain they are acting in.
most ontology matching mechanisms,  however, assume matching prior integration and rely on  semantics that has been coded a priori in concept hierarchies or  external sources.
ontology matching is currently a key technology to achieve the semantic alignment of ontological entities used by knowledge-based applications, and therefore to enable their interoperability in distributed environments such as  multiagent systems.
