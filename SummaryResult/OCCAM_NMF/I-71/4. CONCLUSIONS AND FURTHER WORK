the formal model exposed in this paper will constitute a solid base of future practical results.
we plan to  further refine the model presented here (e.g., to include  pragmatic issues such as termination criteria for the alignment process) and to devise concrete ontology negotiation  protocols based on this model that agents may be able to enact.
in the future, our effort will focus on the practical side of the situated semantic alignment problem.
instead the model we have presented in this paper makes explicit the particular states of the  environment in which agents are situated and are attempting to gradually align their ontological entities.
their approach to semantic alignment, however, like most ontology matching mechanisms  developed to date (regardless of whether they follow a functional, design-time-based approach, or an interaction-based,  runtime-based approach), still defines semantic alignment in terms of a priori design decisions such as the concept  taxonomy of the ontologies or the external sources brought into the alignment process.
before us, kent [6] and kalfoglou and schorlemmer [4, 10] have applied channel theory to formalise semantic alignment using also barwise and seligman"s insight to focus on tokens as the enablers of information flow.
in this paper we have exposed a formal model of semantic alignment as a sequence of information-channel refinements that are relative to the particular states of the environment in which two agents communicate and align their respective conceptualisations of these states.
