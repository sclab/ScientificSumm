agents communicate in order to cooperate successfully and success is guaranteed using constrains of the distributed logic.
the only constraint from the above ones that remains plausible according to c2 is : 1, r(robot2) , 2, ul(robot1) , 1, c(package) c2 2, u(package) notice that this constraint is an element of the theory of the distributed logic.
c2 also considers the previous information and hence refines c1 .

from these, only the following constraints are plausible according to c1 : the sixth intl.
joint conf.
once finished, robot2 searches in th(c1 ) for constraints similar to the expected one, that is, those of the form: 1, r(robot2) , 2, ul(robot1) , 1, c(package) c1 2, λ(package) where λ ∈ {u, r, d, l, ur, dr, dl, ul}.
see figure 7. robot1 sends a request of the form: ` request :sender robot1 :receiver robot2 :language packages distribution-language :ontology lcr-ontology :content (pick up r(robot2) because c(package) ´ robot2 does not understand the content of the request but they decide to begin a process of alignment -corresponding with a channel c1 .
now, problems arise when a lcr robot and a urdl robot try to interoperate.
` request :sender robot1 :receiver robot2 :language packages distribution-language :ontology urdl-ontology :content (pick up u(package) because ur(robot2) ´ figure 6: robot assistance robot2 understands the content of the request and it can use a rule represented by the following constraint: 1, ur(robot2) , 2, ul(robot1) , 1, u(package) 2, u(package) the above constraint should be interpreted intuitively as: if robot2 is situated in robot1"s up-right square, robot1 is situated in robot2"s up-left square and a package is located in robot1"s up square, then a package is located in robot2"s up square.
this request is written below as a kqml message and it should be interpreted intuitively as: robot2, pick up the package located in my up square, knowing that you are located in my up-right square.
let us suppose two urdl robots are in a situation like the one depicted in figure 6. robot1 (the one carrying a package) decides to ask robot2 for assistance and sends a request.
figure 5: robots field of vision when a robot carrying a package finds another package obstructing its way, it can either go around it or, if there is another robot in its visual field, ask it for assistance.
both of them are very simple and are just confined to describe what robots observe.
in our scenario, there coexist two ontologies, the udrl and lcr ontologies.
in order to communicate, agents send messages using some ontology.
all robots in the system must be able to solve package distribution problems cooperatively by communicating their intentions to each other.
we assume the reader has all those descriptions in mind.
describing the environment states as well as the robots" perception functions is rather tedious and even unnecessary.
we call them urdl (shortened form of up-right-down-left) and lcr (abbreviation for left-center-right) robots respectively.
some robots are capable of observing the eight adjoining squares but others just observe the three squares they have in front (see figure 5).
figure 4: the scenario robots have a partial view of the domain and there exist two kinds of robots according to the visual field they have.
robots can carry only one package at a time and they can not move through a package.
let us reflect on a system consisting of robots located in a two-dimensional grid looking for packages with the aim of moving them to a certain destination (figure 4).
we study a very simple example and explain how agents can use those approximations of the logic of ssa they can obtain through communication.
in this section, we give a brushstroke of the pragmatic view of our approach.
however, we have not tackled the practical aspect of the model yet.
in the previous section we have described in great detail our formal model for ssa.
