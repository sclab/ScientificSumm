[14] compared two mechanisms based on expected social utility with expectation taken over an empirical distribution of equilibria in games defined by heuristic strategies, as in [18]. 
most recently, phelps et al.
in this work the authors used a common learning strategy for all agents and defined an outcome of a game induced by a mechanism parameter as the outcome of joint agent learning.
an alternative to co-evolution explored in [16] was to  optimize a well-defined welfare function of the designer using genetic programming.
one approach in that direction, taken in [4] and [15], is to co-evolve the mechanism parameter and agent strategies,  using some notion of social utility and agent payoffs as fitness  criteria.
when payoff functions of players are unknown, a search using simulations has been explored as an alternative.
conitzer and sandholm [6] developed a search algorithm when all the relevant game  parameters are common knowledge.
several related approaches to search for the best mechanism  exist in the computer science literature.
in much of this work, analytical results are presented with respect to specific utility  functions and accounting for constraints such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality.
additionally, there is an extensive  literature on optimal auction design [10], of which the work by roger myerson [11] is, perhaps, the most relevant.
the mechanism design literature in economics has typically  explored existence of a mechanism that implements a social choice function in equilibrium [10].
