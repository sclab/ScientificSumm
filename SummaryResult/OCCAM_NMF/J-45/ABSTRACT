more generally, we show that under certain  conditions, the estimator of optimal mechanism parameter setting based on empirical data is consistent.
our empirical mechanism analysis models the relation between a key design parameter and outcomes, confirming the observed behavior and indicating that no reasonable parameter settings would have been likely to achieve the desired effect.
designers adopted  several rule changes in order to deter particular procurement behavior, but the measures proved insufficient.
we illustrate our approach with a design task from a supply-chain trading competition.
our proposed methods employ learning and search techniques to estimate outcome features of interest as a function of mechanism parameter settings.
