definition 2. a game [i, {ri}, {ui(r)}] is symmetric if for all i, j ∈ i, (a) ri = rj and (b) ui(ri, r−i) = uj (rj, r−j)  whenever ri = rj and r−i = r−j 
in this study we devote particular attention to games that exhibit symmetry with respect to payoffs, rendering agents strategically identical.
thus, (r) as defined above (1) is such that profile r is an -nash equilibrium iff (r) ≤ .
we often appeal to the concept of an approximate, or -nash equilibrium, where is the maximum benefit to any agent for  deviating from the prescribed strategy.
when r ∈ a, the above defines a pure strategy nash equilibrium; otherwise the definition describes a mixed strategy nash  equilibrium.
, rm) constitutes a nash equilibrium of game [i, {ri}, {ui(r)}] if for every i ∈ i, ri ∈ ri, ui(ri, r−i) ≥ ui(ri, r−i).
definition 1. a strategy profile r = (r1, .
a configuration where all agents play strategies that are best responses to the others  constitutes a nash equilibrium.
faced with a game, an agent would ideally play its best strategy given those played by the other agents.
(r) = max i∈i max ai∈ai [ui(ai, r−i) − ui(r)], (1) where r belongs to some strategy set, r, of either pure or mixed strategies.
we define a function, : r → r, interpreted as the maximum benefit any player can obtain by deviating from its strategy in the specified profile.
, um(·)}.
we also express the set of utility functions of all players as u(·) = {u1(·), .
occasionally, we write ui(x, y) to mean that x ∈ ai or si and y ∈ a−i or s−i depending on context.
although any extensive game can be recast in normal form, doing so may sacrifice compactness and blur relevant distinctions (e.g., subgame perfection).
we could capture finer-grained decisions about  action over time in the extensive form.
this is appropriate for our current study, which treats strategies (agent programs) as atomic actions.
we can extend this definition to mixed strategies by assuming that ui are von neumann-morgenstern (vnm) utilities as follows: ui(s) = es[ui], where es is the expectation taken with respect to the probability distribution of play induced by the players" mixed strategy s. 2 by employing the normal form, we model agents as playing a  single action, with decisions taken simultaneously.
when the distribution s is not  correlated, we can simply say si(ai) when referring to the probability player i plays ai under s. next, we define the payoff (utility) function of each player i by ui : a1 ×· · ·×am → r, where ui(ai, a−i) indicates the payoff to player i to playing pure strategy ai when the remaining players play a−i.
when the game is finite (i.e., a and i are both finite), the probability that a ∈ a is played under s is written s(a) = s(ai, a−i).
to accommodate this, we use a−i to denote the joint strategy of all players other than player i. let si be the set of all probability distributions (mixtures) over ai and, similarly, s be the set of all distributions over a. an s ∈ s is called a mixed strategy profile.
it is often convenient to refer to a strategy of player i separately from that of the remaining players.
we designate the set of pure strategies available to player i by ai, and denote the joint set of pure strategies of all players by a = a1 ×.
.×rm representing the set of joint strategies of all players.
ri is the set of strategies available to player i ∈ i, with r = r1 ×.
a normal form game2 is denoted by [i, {ri}, {ui(r)}], where i refers to the set of players and m = |i| is the number of players.
