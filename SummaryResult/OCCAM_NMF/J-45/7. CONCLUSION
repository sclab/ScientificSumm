the theoretical results confirm some intuitions behind the empirical mechanism design methods we have introduced, and increases our confidence that our framework can be effective in  estimating the best mechanism parameter choice in relatively general settings.
the success of our analysis in this extremely complex environment with high  simulation costs makes us optimistic that our methods can provide  guidance in making mechanism design decisions in other challenging domains.
in the case of tac/scm, our evidence suggests quite strongly that storage cost could not have been effectively adjusted in the 2004 tournament to curb excessive day-0 procurement  without detrimental effects on overall profitability.
in the end, we can try to provide enough evidence to either prescribe a parameter setting, or suggest that no setting is possible that will satisfy the designer.
thus, we concentrate on collecting evidence about the structure of the nash equilibrium correspondence.
in applying empirical game analysis to the problem at hand, we are fully aware that our results are inherently inexact.
a difficult design issue in the tac/scm game which the tac community has been eager to address provides us with a setting to test our methods.
our techniques are designed specifically to deal with problems in which both the mechanism parameter space and the agent strategy sets are infinite and only a relatively small data set can be acquired.
we also described in some generality the methods for estimating a sample nash  equilibrium function when the data is extremely scarce, or a nash  equilibrium correspondence when more data is available.
we defined a formal  gametheoretic model of interaction between the designer and the  participants of the mechanism as a two-stage game.
in this work we spent considerable effort developing general  tactics for empirical mechanism design.
