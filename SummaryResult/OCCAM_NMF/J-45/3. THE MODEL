in the remainder of this paper, we apply our modeling approach, together with several empirical game-theoretic methods, in order to answer questions regarding the design of the tac/scm scenario. 
(either do or ds may be null for a particular problem.)
let d = {do, ds} be the combined data set.
, (θk+l , ak+l , uk+l )}.
we may also have additional data generated by a (possibly noisy) simulator: ds = {(θk+1 , ak+1 , uk+1 ), .
, (θk , ak , uk )}, where for every data point θi is the observed mechanism parameter setting, ai is the observed pure strategy profile of the participants, and ui is the corresponding realization of agent payoffs.
additionally, we wish to study games where the payoffs are not explicitly given, but must be determined from simulation or other experience with the game.5 accordingly, we assume that we are given a (possibly noisy) data set of payoff realizations: do = {(θ1 , a1 , u1 ), .
however, even for a game γθ with known payoffs it may be  computationally intractable to solve for nash equilibria, particularly if the game has large or infinite strategy sets.
alternatively, given a simulator that could produce an  unbiased sample from the distribution of w (n(θ), θ) for any θ, the designer would be faced with another much appreciated problem in the literature: simulation optimization [12].
given a description of the solution correspondence n(θ)  (equivalently, φ∗ (θ)), the designer faces a standard optimization  problem.
for example, φ∗ (θ) could be decreasing in θ, whereas n(θ) might have a more complex structure.
if we have chosen our aggregator carefully, we may also capture structure not obvious otherwise.
if all we care about is the total value played, we may take φ(a) = pm i=1 ai.
for example, suppose-as in our  application below-that an agent"s strategy is defined by a numeric parameter.
using an aggregation function yields a more compact  representation of strategy profiles.
for convenience of exposition, we write φ∗ (θ) to mean φ(n(θ)).
we overload the function symbol to apply to sets of strategy  profiles: φ( ˆr) = {φ(r) : r ∈ ˆr}.
definition 3. a function φ : r1 × · · · × rm → rq is an aggregation function if m ≥ q and w (r, θ) = v (φ(r), θ) for some function v .
307 specified in terms of agent strategies to an equivalent welfare  outcome specified in terms of a lower-dimensional summary.
for example, if one has a  probability distribution over the solution set n(θ), it would be natural to take the expectation of w (r, θ) instead.
4 again, alternatives are available.
however, much of the methodology developed here could be employed with alternative criteria for deriving agent behavior from a game definition.
typically we care about w (n(θ), θ), the worst-case outcome of playing some solution.4 on some problems we can gain considerable advantage by  using an aggregation function to map the welfare outcome of a game 3 we generally adopt nash equilibrium as the solution concept, and thus take n(θ) to be the set of equilibria.
we refer to γθ as a game induced by θ. let n(θ) be the set of strategy profiles considered solutions of the game γθ.3 suppose that the goal of the designer is to optimize the value of some welfare function, w (r, θ), dependent on the mechanism parameter and resulting play, r. we define a pessimistic measure, w ( ˆr, θ) = inf{w (r, θ) : r ∈ ˆr}, representing the worst-case welfare of the game induced by θ, assuming that agents play some joint strategy in ˆr.
since the participants play with full knowledge of the  mechanism parameter, we define a game between them in the second stage as γθ = [i, {ri}, {ui(r, θ)}].
for example, the designer could be deciding between a first-price and second-price sealed-bid auction mechanisms, with the presumption that after the choice has been made, the bidders will participate with full  awareness of the auction rules.
the designer moves first by selecting a value, θ, from a set of allowable  mechanism settings, θ. all the participant agents observe the mechanism parameter θ and move simultaneously thereafter.
we model the strategic interactions between the designer of the mechanism and its participants as a two-stage game.
