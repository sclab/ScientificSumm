acknowledgments we would like to thank nick craswell for insightful  discussions and the anonymous referees for useful remarks.
hopefully, further analyses of the graph defined in this paper,  according to the approach described, can be insightful for a better understanding of trec or similar data.
the same kind of analysis could be performed at the document level, measuring document ease.
it would be  interesting to compute the higher-order eigenvectors of at a and aat .
other centrality indicators, widely used in social network analysis, could be computed, although probably with similar results to pagerank.
for instance, other effectiveness metrics could be used, in place of ap.
this is an initial work, and further analyses could be  performed.
moreover, we are not explicitly proposing a change to current trec methodology, although this could be a by-product of these - and further - analyses.
adding (removing) a new system / topic would mean re-computing hubness and  authority indicators.
our method of analysis, as described in this paper, can be applied only a posteriori, i.e., once we have all the  topics and all the systems available.
also, it is  suggested that a cluster analysis on topic similarity can lead to relying on a lower number of topics.
the analysis shows that, with current measures, a system that wants to be effective in trec needs to be effective on easy topics.
we note that no such approach to trec data analysis has been proposed so far.
the normalized measures (apm and apa) are used to build a bipartite weighted systems-topics graph, that is then  analyzed by means of network analysis indicators widely known in the (social) network analysis field, but somewhat  generalised.
more particularly, we propose average average precision (aap), a measure of topic ease, and a novel way of  normalizing the average precision measure in trec, on the basis of both map (mean average precision) and aap.
developments the contribution of this paper is threefold: • we propose a novel way of normalizing ap values; • we propose a novel method to analyse trec data; • the method applied on trec data does indeed reveal some hidden properties.
