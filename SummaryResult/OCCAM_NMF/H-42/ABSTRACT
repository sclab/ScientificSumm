categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval]: information search and retrieval general terms measurement, experimentation 
we apply this method to an analysis of trec 8 data; among the results, we find that authority measures systems  performance, that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems, that with current measures a system that wants to be effective in trec needs to be effective on easy topics, and that by using different effectiveness measures this is no longer the case.
we analyze the meaning of well known - and somewhat generalized - indicators from social network analysis on the systems-topics graph.
we define two normalized versions of average  precision, that we use to construct a weighted bipartite graph of trec systems and topics.
we propose a novel method of analysing data gathered from trec or similar information retrieval evaluation  experiments.
