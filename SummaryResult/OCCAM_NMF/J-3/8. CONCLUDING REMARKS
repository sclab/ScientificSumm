acknowledgments we thank rohit rao, zoya svitkina and adam wildavsky for helpful discussions. 
in [3], it was shown that when a set of advertisers use a strategy similar to the one we suggest here, under a slightly modified first-price auction, the prices approach a well-understood market equilibrium.
finally, we have looked at this system as a black box returning clicks as a function of bid, whereas in reality it is a complex repeated game involving multiple  advertisers.
(a  conversion corresponds to an action on the part of the user who clicked through to the advertiser site; e.g., a sale or an  account sign-up.)
another interesting generalization is to consider weights on the clicks, which is a way to model conversions.
of course the scenario does change, however, and so coming up with a stochastic bidding strategy remains an important open direction, explored somewhat by [11, 13].
our algorithmic result presents an intriguing heuristic in practice: bid a single value b on all keywords; at the end of the day, if the budget is under-spent, adjust b to be higher; if budget is overspent, adjust b to be lower; else, maintain b. if the scenario does not change from day to day, this simple strategy will have the same theoretical properties as our one-bid strategy, and in practice, is likely to be much better.
