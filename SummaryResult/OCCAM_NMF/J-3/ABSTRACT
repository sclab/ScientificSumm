we also present inapproximability results, and optimal algorithms for  variants of the budget optimization problem.
as our preliminary experiments show, such uniform strategies are likely to be practical.
more precisely, this strategy gets at least a 1 âˆ’ 1/e fraction of the maximum clicks possible.
while most variants are np-hard, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that simply randomizing between two uniform strategies that bid equally on all the keywords works well.
we model the entire process and study this budget optimization problem.
in this work, we focus on the advertisers, who must solve a complex optimization problem to decide how to place bids on  keywords to maximize their return (the number of user clicks on their ads) for a given budget.
while there has been previous work on the auction process and its game-theoretic aspects, most of it focuses on the internet company.
internet search companies sell advertisement slots based on users" search queries via an auction.
