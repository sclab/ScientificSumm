theorem 8. the weighted keyword bidding  problem is hard to approximate to within (1 − 1/e). 
with this additional generalization we can show hardness of approximation via a simple reduction from the maximum coverage problem, which is known to be (1−1/e)-hard [6] (proof omitted).
call this the weighted keyword bidding problem.
formally, we have weights wq for all q ∈ q and our goal is maximize the total weighted traffic given a budget.
now suppose we introduce weights on the queries that indicate the relative value of a click from the various search users.

by a reduction from vertex cover we can show the  following (proof omitted): theorem 7. budget optimization is strongly np-hard.
