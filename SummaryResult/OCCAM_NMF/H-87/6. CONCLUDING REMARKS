for future research we want to study explicit modeling of the temporal trends in topic distributions and content drifting.
• we found rocchio performs strongly when a good validation corpus is available, and a preferred choice when optimizing ctrk is the objective, favoring recall over precision to an extreme.
• we found lr more robust than rocchio; it had the best results (in t11su) ever reported on tdt5, trec10 and trec11 without extensive tuning.
• robustness in cross-corpus parameter tuning is important for evaluation and method comparison.
our main conclusions from this study are the following: • parameter optimization in af is an open challenge but has not been thoroughly studied in the past.
we presented a cross-benchmark evaluation of incremental rocchio and incremental lr in adaptive filtering, focusing on their robustness in terms of performance consistency with respect to cross-corpus parameter optimization.
