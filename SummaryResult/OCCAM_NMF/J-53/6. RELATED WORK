milchtaich [16] studied congestion games with private preferences but the technique in [16] is specific to the congestion game. 
for example, unlike those games, there may  exist multiple nash equilibria in our game.
but those techniques no longer apply to our game because we model users as having fixed budgets and private preferences for machines.
their  methodology follows the study of congestion (potential) games [17, 22] by relating the nash equilibrium to the solution of a (usually convex) global optimization problem.
there have been several analyses [10, 11, 12, 13, 23] of variations of price-anticipating allocation schemes in the  context of allocation of network capacity for flows.
the  priceanticipating scheme that we consider does not explicitly  operate on complementarities, thereby possibly losing some  efficiency, but it also avoids the complexity and overhead of combinatorial auctions.
solving the np-complete combinatorial auction  problem provides an optimally efficient allocation.
share allocates resources using a centralized combinatorial auction that allows users to express preferences with  complementarities.
bellagio[3] uses the share centralized allocator.
the tradeoff of the price-anticipating schemes is that users have uncertainty about exactly how much of the resources they will receive.
unfortunately, reservations have a high latency to acquire resources, unlike the price-anticipating scheme we consider.
uses a reservation abstraction similar to the way airline seats are allocated.

examples of the economic approach are spawn [26]), work by stoica, et al.
resource allocation divides a resource among different users while scheduling takes a given  allocation and orders a user"s jobs.
we view scheduling and resource allocation as two separate functions.
these all assume that the values and resource consumption of tasks are reported accurately, which does not apply in the presence of strategic users.
examples of this approach are queuing in first-come, first-served (fcfs) order, queueing using the  resource consumption of tasks (e.g., [28]), and scheduling  using combinatorial optimization [19].
one non-economic approach is scheduling (surveyed by pinedo [20]).
there are two main groups of related work in resource allocation: those that incorporate an economic mechanism, and those that do not.
