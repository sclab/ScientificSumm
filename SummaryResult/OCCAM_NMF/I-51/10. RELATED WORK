in our framework we have addressed both argument selection and preference relations using a case-based approach. 
although argument selection is a key aspect of automated argumentation (see [12] and [13]), most  research has been focused on preference relations among arguments.
approaches for logic and languages that support argumentation include defeasible logic [4] and bdi models [13].
research on mas argumentation focus on several issues like a) logics, protocols and languages that support argumentation, b)  argument selection and c) argument interpretation.
the main difference is that our mac approach is a way to distribute the reuse process of cbr (using a voting system) while retrieve is performed individually by each agent; the other  multiagent cbr approaches, however, focus on distributing the retrieve process.
distributed systems where there are several case bases available for the same task and addresses the problems of cross-case base  adaptation.

finally, another interesting  approach is multi-case-base reasoning (mcbr) [5], that deals with the sixth intl.
our work on multi-agent case-based learning started in 1999 [6]; later mc ginty and smyth [7] presented a multi-agent collaborative cbr approach (ccbr) for planning.
concerning cbr in a multi-agent setting, the first research was on negotiated case retrieval [11] among groups of agents.
