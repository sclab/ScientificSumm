at round 3, since all the agents agree (all the justified  predictions in h3 predict hadromerida as the solution class) the  protocol ends, and a1 (the agent that received the problem) considers hadromerida as the joint solution for the problem p. 
after that, h3 = α0 1, β2 3 , α1 3 .
the result is that the local confidence of the counterargument β2 3 is higher than the local confidence of α0 2. therefore, a2 accepts the counterargument and informs the rest of the agents with the message assert(β2 3 ).
agent a2 receives the  counterargument and assesses its local confidence.
a3 generates a  counterargument β2 3 = a3, p, hadromerida, d6 for α0 2 and sends it to a2 with the message rebut(β2 3 , α0 2).
round 2 starts and a3 gets the token.
the result is that the individual confidence of the  counterargument β1 2 is lower than the local confidence of α1 3. therefore, a3 does not accept the counterargument, and thus h2 = α0 1, α0 2, α1 3 .
agent a3 receives the counterargument and assesses its local  confidence.
a2 tries to generate  counterarguments for α0 1 and α1 3 and only succeeds to generate a  counterargument β1 2 = a2, p, astrophorida, d5 against α1 3. the counterargument is sent to a3 with the message rebut(β1 2 , α1 3).
round 1 starts and a2 gets the token.
thus, all of them know the new h1 = α0 1, α0 2, α1 3 .
a3 comes up with the justified prediction α1 3 = a3, p, hadromerida, d4 , and broadcasts it to the rest of the agents with the message assert(α1 3).
a3 incorporates c13 into its case base and tries to solve the problem p again, now taking c13 into consideration.
in particular, in this example: • α0 1 = a1, p, hadromerida, d1 • α0 2 = a2, p, astrophorida, d2 • α0 3 = a3, p, axinellida, d3 a1 starts owning the token and tries to generate  counterarguments for α0 2 and α0 3, but does not succeed, however it has one counterexample c13 for α0 3. thus, a1 sends the the message rebut( c13, α0 3) to a3.
thus, all of them can compute h0 = α0 1, α0 2, α0 3 .
initially, each agent generates its individual prediction for p, and broadcasts it to the other agents.
they accept the invitation, and the argumentation protocol starts.
for that reason, invites a2 and a3 to take part in the argumentation process.
one of the agents, a1 receives a problem p to solve, and  decides to use amal to solve it.
let us consider a system composed of three agents a1, a2 and a3.
