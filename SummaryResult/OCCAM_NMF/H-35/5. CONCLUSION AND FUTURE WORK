experimental results based on four benchmark datasets show that adarank can significantly outperform the baseline methods of bm25, ranking svm, and rankboost.
adarank offers several advantages: ease of implementation, theoretical soundness, efficiency in training, and high accuracy in ranking.
it employs a boosting technique in ranking model learning.
in contrast to existing methods, adarank optimizes a loss function that is directly defined on the performance measures.
in this paper we have proposed a novel algorithm for learning ranking models in document retrieval, referred to as adarank.
