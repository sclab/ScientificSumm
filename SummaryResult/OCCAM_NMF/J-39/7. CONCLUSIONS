for instance, does the  options scheme change seller incentives from what they  currently are on ebay?
in addition to exploring more sophisticated proxies that bid in terms of maximum willingness to pay, future work should aim to better model seller incentives and resolve the strategic problems facing sellers.
our scheme provides bidders with a simple, dominant and  truthful bidding strategy even though the market remains open and dynamic.
we introduced a new sales channel, consisting of an  optionsbased and proxied auction protocol, to address the  sequential auction problem that exists when bidders face  multiple auctions for substitutes and complements goods.
