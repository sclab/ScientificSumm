section 5 discusses the  future work with some concluding remarks. 
in section 4, we discuss our approach to integrative negotiation.
section 3 formulates the problem.
section 2 provides background on mcdm theory and the negotiation  framework.
to take advantage of existing results in  negotiation analysis and operations research (or) literatures [18], we employ multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) theory to allow the negotiation problem to be represented and analysed.
the mediator thus plays two roles in a  negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.
in this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.
however, because of the negotiator"s dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both  negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.
negotiation support systems (nsss) and negotiating software 508 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas agents (nsas) have been introduced either to assist humans in making decisions or to enable automated negotiation to allow  computer processes to engage in meaningful negotiation to reach  agreements (see, for instance, [14, 15, 19, 6, 5]).
for instance, few buyers would start a bargaining with a dealer over a deal for a notebook computer by declaring that he is most interested in an extended warranty for the item and therefore prepared to pay a high price to get such an extended warranty.
that is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another  issue) to meet his opponent"s interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.
this is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponent"s interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.
in fact, more often than not, the two  processes interplay with each other making information manipulation become part of the integrative bargaining process.
coming back to the negotiator"s dilemma, it"s not always  possible to separate the integrative bargaining process from the  distributive bargaining process.
but at the same time, her opponent is well aware of the fact that it is her incentive to boost her bargaining strength and thus will not accept every information she sends out unless it is substantiated by evidence.
other buyers who have expressed genuine interest with fairly good offers) consist in the information that improves her  bargaining strength about which she would like to convey to her opponent.
on the other hand, the outside options available to her (e.g.
for instance, when bargaining to sell a house to a potential buyer, the seller would try to hide her actual reserve price as much as possible for she hopes to reach an agreement at a much higher price than her  reserve price.
such private information contains both the information that implies the agent"s bottom lines (or, her walk-away positions) and the  information that enforces her bargaining strength.
we argue that the negotiator"s dilemma is essentially  informationbased, due to the private information held by the agents.
they refer to this problem as the negotiator"s dilemma.
negotiators face a dilemma in deciding whether to pursue a cooperative or a competitive strategy at a particular time during a negotiation.
they argue that negotiation necessarily includes both cooperative and  competitive elements, and that these elements exist in tension.
according to conflict theorists lax and sebenius [13], most negotiation  actually involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which they refer to as creating value and claiming value.
raiffa [17] and sebenius [20] provide analyses on the negotiators" failure to achieve efficient agreements in practice and their unwillingness to disclose private information due to strategic reasons.
given that negotiation is perhaps one of the oldest activities in the history of human communication, it"s perhaps surprising that conducted experiments on negotiations have shown that negotiators more often than not reach inefficient compromises [1, 21].
