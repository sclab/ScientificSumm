in  order to provide a complete framework we are also working on the distributive phase using the mediator.
there is also future work to be done in more fully characterising the outcomes of the determination of values for the non-simple attributes.
the details of the approach have currently been shown only for bilateral negotiation, and while we believe they are generalisable to multiple negotiators, this work remains to be done.
their experimental results show that agents can reach  paretooptimal outcomes using their approach.
thus, their approach can be considered a complement of ours.
jonker et al [7] consider an approach to multi-attribute negotiation without the use of a  mediator.
their main result is an experiment showing that in some situations, agents" cooperativeness may not bring the most benefits to the organisation as a whole, while giving no explanation.
they assume that agents are honest.
zhang et at [22] discuss the use of integrative negotiation in agent organisations.
while their approach was clearly described for the case of two-issue negotiations, the generalisation to  negotiations with more than two issues is not entirely clear.
lai et al [12] provide an alternative approach to integrative negotiation.
the relation of their approach to our approach is discussed in the  preceding section.
ehtamo et al [4] presents an  approach to searching for joint gains in multi-party negotiations.
the approach presented in this paper is similar to the ideas  behind negotiation analysis [18].
for non-simple  attributes we propose a mechanism that provides stepwise  improvements to move the proposed solution in the direction of a  paretooptimal solution.
we have shown that as long as one of the simple attributes does not strongly dominate the  others, then truth telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the stage of optimising simple attributes.
in order to discourage agents from  misrepresenting their utilities to gain an advantage, we look for solutions that are least vulnerable to manipulation.
those which have a finite set of values) we use known optimisation techniques to find a  paretooptimal solution.
for simple attributes (i.e.
we have developed a two step process for  addressing the np-hard problem of finding a solution for a set of  integrative attributes, which is within the pareto-optimal set for those attributes.
no aspect can be improved for one of the parties without worsening the  outcome for another party), and also for fairness, which chooses  optimal solutions which distribute gains amongst the agents in some appropriate manner.
that is, the approach that we describe aims for both efficiency, in the sense that it produces pareto optimal outcomes (i.e.
furthermore, the mediator also works toward the goal of achieving fairness of the negotiation outcome.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) we have introduced a mediator into the negotiation in order to  allow negotiators to disclose information about their utilities,  without providing this information to their opponents.

the focus of the paper is on integrative  negotiation in which agents aim to maximise joint gains, or create value.
in this paper we have established a framework for negotiation that is based on mcdm theory for representing the agents"  objectives and utilities.
