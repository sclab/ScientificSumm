we proposed new network functions to enable server migration and replication across wide area networks (such as the internet or a geographically distributed virtual private network), and finally showed the utility of intelligent and dynamic storage replication technology to ensure applications have access to data in the face of outages with very tight recovery point objectives. 
we advocated using server virtualization technologies to  enable the replication and migration of server functions.
we sought to achieve high availability of data center services in the face of both planned and incidental outages of data center  facilities.
in this paper we advocated a cooperative, context-aware approach to data center migration across wans to deal with outages in a non-disruptive manner.
a significant concern for internet-based service providers is the continued operation and availability of services in the face of  outages, whether planned or unplanned.
