we show that the class of utility functions that have marginal utilities with compact support and for which the relevant  demand functions are income-lipschitzian has finite fat  shattering dimension.
we notice however, that in this case we obtain a utility function that yield demand functions that are very sensitive to small price changes.
unfortunately,  rescaling the previous example shows that even a compact set may contain a large shattered set.
in many cases it is reasonable to assume that the marginal for very large bundles is very small, or even that the utility or the marginal utility have compact support.
, (ynd, pnd) is  consistent with monotone concave utility function maximization and again by afriat"s theorem there exists u supporting a demand function fb ✷ the proof above relies on the fact that an agent have high utility and marginal utility for very large bundles.
it follows that there are no negative cycles for the union of observations from all levels hence the sequence of  observations (y1, p1), (y11, p11), (y12, p12), .
the other direction of afriat"s theorem  therefore implies there can be no negative cycles within points on the same level.
thus, the polytope defines a utility function for which these demands are utility maximizing.
the points of any one level lie on the facets of a polytope λi and the prices pis are supporting hyperplanes of the polytope.
= o(1) this shows that pir · (yjs − yir) = pi · (ys − yi) + o(1) = 2j−i − 1 + o(1) therefore pir · (yjs − yir) ≤ 0 iff j < i or i = j. this implies that if there is a negative cycle then all the points in the cycle must belong to the same level.
applying h¨olders inequality we get |pir · yjs − pi · yj | ≤ |(pir − pi) · yj| + |pir · (yjs − yj)| ||pir − pi||∞ · ||yj ||1 + ||yjs − yj||∞ · ||pir||1.

to avoid this problem we reprove the theorem by constructing utility functions u such that u(xi) = u(xi ) for all i and therefore a distinct utility function is associated with each labeling.
, pn is the result of indifference rather than genuine preference.
therefore the shattering of the prices p1, .
in fact, pick a utility function whose level sets are parallel to the budget constraint.
✷ proof 2: the utility functions satisfying afriat"s condition in the first proof could be trivial assigning the same utility to xi as to xi .
since yi are in the budget 40 set yi · 2−i p = 1, therefore pi · (yj − yi) = 2j−i − 1. this shows that pi · (yj − yi) ≤ 0 iff j < i hence there can be no negative cycles and the condition is met.
to show that such a function exists it suffices to show that afriat"s conditions are satisfied.

theorem 5. let c be a set of demand functions from rd + to rd + then fatc(γ) = ∞ proof 1: for ε > 0 let pi = 2−i p for i = 1, .
we show that the class has a finite fat shattering dimension that depends on the support and the income-lipschitz constant.
the second class we  consider is the class of demand functions derived from utilities with bounded support and income-lipschitz.
the first is the class of all demand functions, we show that this class has infinite shattering dimension (we give two proofs) and is therefore not pac learnable.
we compute the fat shattering dimension for two classes of demands.
as we have seen in section 4 the number of observations required to pac learn the demand depends on the fat shattering dimension of the class of demand functions which in turn depends on the class of utility functions they are derived from.
preference algorithm 1 is an efficient learning algorithm in the sense that it finds a hypothesis with sample error zero in time polynomial in the number of observations.
