we may therefore assume from here on that demand functions are single valued. 
it rules out different demands for the similar prices.
this property reflects an assumption that preferences and demands have some sort of stability.
a demand function is l-income-lipschitz, for l ∈ r+, if ||f(p) − f(p )||∞ dp (p, p ) ≤ l for any p, p ∈ ∆d.
note that with this metric ∆d is compact.
, d} for p, p ∈ ∆d.
for these prices we take the metric dp (p, p ) = max{| 1 pi − 1 pi | : i = 1, .
, 0)}.
, 1, .
we are thus interested in forecasts for prices below the simplex ∆d = conv{(0, .
any budget set that is not a subset of the support is maximized on any point outside the support and it is therefore difficult to forecast for these prices.
we assume u has marginal utility zero outside [0, 1]d .
37 since large quantities of any good are likely to create  utility decreasing externalities, we assume the prices are limited to a compact set.
the demand function of the agent is the correspondence fu : rn + → rn + satisfying f(p) = argmax{u(x) : p · x ≤ i} in general this correspondence is not necessarily single  valued, but it is implicit in the proof of afriat"s theorem that any set of observations can be rationalized by a demand function that is single valued for unobserved prices.
these  assumptions imply that the utility function is concave and monotone on the observations.
this is the law of diminishing marginal utility which assumes that the larger the excess of one good over the other the less we value each additional good of one kind over the other.
the second assumption we make on the utility is that all the marginals (partial derivatives) are monotone decreasing.
however, in such cases the demand will be an interior point of the budget set and the less preferred bundles won"t be observed.
this, of course, does not necessarily hold in practice, as in many cases excess supply may lead to  storage expenses or other externalities.
this  reflects the assumption that agents will always prefer more of any one good.
the first assumption we make is that the function is  monotone increasing, namely, if x ≥ y, in the sense that the inequality holds coordinatewise, then u(x) ≥ u(y).
a rational agent with a budget that w.l.g equals 1 facing a price vector p ∈ rn + will choose from her budget set b(p) = {x ∈ rn + : p · x ≤ 1} a bundle x ∈ rn + that maximizes her private utility.
a utility function u : rn + → r is a function relating  bundles of goods to a cardinal in a manner reflecting the  preferences over the bundles.
