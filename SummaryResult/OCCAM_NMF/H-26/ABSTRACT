categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information search and retrieval]: retrieval models general terms algorithm, theory, experimentation 
in most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant  improvements in map scores.
we evaluate our approach using the trec 9 and trec 10 web track corpora (wt10g), comparing against svms optimized for accuracy and rocarea.
in contrast, we present a general svm learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of map.
existing approaches  optimizing map either do not find a globally optimal solution, or are computationally expensive.
due to computational difficulties, few  learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean average precision (map), despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems.
machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked  retrieval systems.
