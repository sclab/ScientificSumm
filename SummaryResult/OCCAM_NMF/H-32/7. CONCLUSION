in our future work, we seek to further improve on the combined system by incorporating more evidence in support of correct  definitional answers or to filter away obviously wrong answers.

for  instance, the top definitional system at the recent trec 2006  evaluation was able to significantly outperform all other systems using relatively simple unigram probabilities extracted from google  snippets.
our approach may also provide some insight into a few anomalies in past definitional question answering"s trials.
although the methods we used are simple, they have been shown experimentally to be  effective.
we approached the problem of definitional question answering from a novel perspective, with the notion that interest factor plays a role in identifying definitional answers.
as a result, we are currently only able to achieve a  hybrid system that has the same level of performance as our proposed human interest model.
indeed, this is natural as the two models have been designed to identify two very different types of definition answers using very different types of features.
"s soft pattern bigram model, the inherent differences between both types of nuggets seemingly caused by the low agreement rates between both models have made this a difficult task.
while we have attempted to build such a system by combining our proposed human interest model with cui et al.
thus we feel that a good definitional question answering system would need to pick up both informative and interesting nugget types in order to provide a complete definitional coverage on all  important aspects of the topic.
what seems to be a good set of definition answers is some general information that provides a quick informative overview mixed together with some novel or interesting aspects about the topic.
we further showed that at least two different types of answer nuggets are required to form a more thorough set of definitional answers.
experimental results has shown this approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art definitional question answering systems.
using this perspective, we have shown that using a combination of a carefully selected external corpus, matching against multiple centroids and taking into consideration rare but highly topic  specific terms, we can build a definitional question answering  module that is more focused on identifying nuggets that are of interest to human beings.
this is very different from the lexico-syntactic pattern  approach where the context of a human reader is not even considered when finding answers for definitional question answering.
the notion of an average human reader is an important consideration in our  approach.
interesting nuggets are uncommon pieces of information about the topic that can evoke a human reader"s curiosity.
this paper has presented a novel perspective for answering  definitional questions through the identification of interesting nuggets.
