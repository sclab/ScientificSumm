we compare and contrast our model with current definitional question answering models to show that interestingness plays an important factor in definitional question answering.
it is hoped that such a model will allow the  computation of human interest in the sentence with respect to the topic.
this paper proposes to address the deficiency by building a human interest model from external knowledge.
this is  insufficient as they do not address the novelty factor that a  definitional nugget must also possess.
current approaches to identifying definitional sentences in the  context of question answering mainly involve the use of linguistic or syntactic patterns to identify informative nuggets.
