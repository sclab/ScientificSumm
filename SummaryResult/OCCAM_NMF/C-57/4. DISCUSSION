in addition, it is of  interest to develop an efficient algorithm for the computation of pure strategy nash equilibrium, as well as discuss the social (in)efficiency of the equilibria. 
in particular, we plan to consider cglfs where the resources may have different costs and failure  probabilities, as well as cglfs in which the resource failure  probabilities are mutually dependent.
in future research we plan to consider various extensions of cglfs.
in particular, we can show the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium for  nondecreasing cglfs also in the modified model.
in the full version we will show that the  modified model leads to similar results.
both the model discussed in this paper and the modified one are reasonable.
the cglf-model can be modified to the case where the agents pay only for non-faulty resources they selected.
nevertheless, if the resource cost functions are nondecreasing then such equilibria are guaranteed to exist, despite the non-existence of a potential function.
we show that these games do not, in general, possess pure strategy equilibria.
we study the existence of pure strategy nash equilibria and potential functions in the presented class of games.
we defined a class of congestion games with load-dependent failures (cglfs), which generalizes the  wellknown class of congestion games.
in this paper, we introduce and investigate congestion  settings with unreliable resources, in which the probability of a resource"s failure depends on the congestion experienced by this resource.
