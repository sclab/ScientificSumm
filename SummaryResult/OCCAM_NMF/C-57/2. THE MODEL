we use the convention thatq e∈∅ f(hσ e ) = 1. hence, if agent i chooses an empty set σi = ∅ (does not assign his task to any resource), then his expected utility, ui(∅, σ−i), equals zero. 
vi − x e∈σi c(hσ e ) , where 1 − q e∈σi f(hσ e ) denotes the probability of successful completion of agent i"s task.
the expected utility of agent i from strategy profile σ, ui(σ), is, therefore: ui(σ) = 1 − y e∈σi f(hσ e ) !
the benefit of agent i from his outcome xi is denoted by vi(xi), where vi(s) = vi, a given (nonnegative) value, and vi(f) = 0. the utility of agent i from strategy profile σ and his  outcome xi, ui(σ, xi), is the difference between his benefit from the outcome (vi(xi)) and the sum of the costs of the  resources he has used: ui(σ, xi) = vi(xi) − x e∈σi c(hσ e ) .
we say that the execution of agent"s i task succeeds if the task of agent i is successfully completed by at least one of the resources chosen by him.
, n} → r+ of the congestion experienced by e. the outcome for agent i ∈ n is denoted by xi ∈ {s, f}, where s and f, respectively, indicate whether the task  execution succeeded or failed.
, n} → [0, 1) of the congestion  experienced by e. the cost of utilizing resource e is a function c : {1, .
the  failure probability of a resource e is a monotone nondecreasing function f : {1, .
the (m-dimensional) congestion vector that corresponds to σ is hσ = (hσ e )e∈m , where hσ e = ˛ ˛{i ∈ n : e ∈ σi} ˛ ˛.
, σn) ∈ σ be a pure strategy profile.
let σ = (σ1, .
we assume that the failure probabilities of the resources are independent.
each resource is associated with a cost, c(·), and a  failure probability, f(·), each of which depends on the  number of agents who use this resource.
the set of pure strategy profiles of all the agents is denoted by σ (σ = σn ).
given a subset s ⊆ n of the agents, the set of strategy combinations of the members of s is denoted by σs = ×i∈sσi, and the set of strategy  combinations of the complement subset of agents is denoted by σ−s (σ−s = σn s = ×i∈n sσi).
that is, σi is the power set of the set of  resources: σi = p(m).
agent i ∈ n chooses a  strategy σi ∈ σi which is a (potentially empty) subset of the resources.
let n be a set of n agents (n ∈ n), and let m be a set of m resources (m ∈ n).
the agents simultaneously choose a subset of the resources in order to perform their tasks, and their aim is to maximize their own expected payoff, as described in the sequel.
the scenarios considered in this work consist of a finite set of agents where each agent has a task that can be carried out by any element of a set of identical resources (service providers).
