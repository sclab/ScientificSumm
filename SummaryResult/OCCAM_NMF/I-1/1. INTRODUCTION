section 5 discusses related work, and in section 6 we present our conclusions and future work. 
in  section 4 we show how we can use can to formally specify the  behaviour of an aborted plan.
in section 2 we give an  example of the consequences of aborting a task, and in section 3 we discuss some circumstances under which aborts should occur, and the appropriate representation and invocation procedures.
this paper is organized as follows.
our focus is on a single agent, complementary to  related work that considers exception handling for single- and  multiagent systems (e.g., [22, 5, 6]).
this allows us to specify an appropriate level of detail for the execution model, without focusing on the specific constructs of any one agent system such as jack [2], jadex [14], jason [6], or spark [9].
we show how aborts can be smoothly introduced into a bdi-style architecture, and for the first time we give an  operational semantics for aborting in the abstract agent language can [23, 17].
accordingly, a central  technical challenge is to manage the orderly execution of the appropriate clean-up code.
this allows a plan to attempt to ensure a stable, known state, and possibly to recover some resources and otherwise clean up before exiting.
a key feature of our procedure-based approach is that we allow each plan to execute some particular code on a failure and on an abort.
in this paper we discuss in detail the incorporation of abort  cleanup methods into the agent execution cycle, providing a unified  approach to failure and abort.
8 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas fails (common approaches include either letting the other branch run to completion unhindered or dropping it completely).
we adopt the latter view and use task to also refer to goals.
a task can be considered a goal of achieving the state of the task having been performed, and a goal can be considered a task of bringing about that state of the world.
as one consequence, most agent systems are quite limited in their treatment of the situation where one branch of a parallel construct 1 one can consider both tasks to be performed and goals to achieve a certain state of the world.
however, there has been relatively little work on the development of abort techniques beyond simple dropping of currently intended plans and tasks, which does not deal with the clean-up required.
there has been a considerable amount of work on plan failures (such as detecting and resolving resource conflicts [20, 10]) and most agent systems incorporate some notion of failure handling.
for failure, it means that parallel-sibling plans may need to be aborted as the failure is propagated up.
for aborting, it means that multiple concurrent sub-plans may need to be aborted as the abort is propagated down.
the potential for concurrently executing sub-plans introduces different complexities for aborting and failure.
failure propagates from the bottom up, whereas aborting propagates from the top down.
in contrast, aborting says nothing about the ability to  perform; it merely eliminates the need.
failure  reflects an inability to perform and does not negate the need to  perform - for example, a reasonable response to failure may be to try again.
aborting a task or plan is distinct from its failure.
this decision may be due to an internal deliberation (such as the agent believing the task can no longer be achieved, or that some  conflicting task now has a higher priority) or due to an external factor (such as another agent altering a commitment, or a change in the environment).
besides dealing with failure, an important capability of an  intelligent agent is to be able to abort a particular task or plan.
given this need for deliberation about failed tasks or plans, failure deliberation is commonly built into the agent"s execution cycle.
failures can occur for a number of reasons, and it is often not possible to predict these in advance, either because of the complexity of the system or  because changes in the environment invalidate some earlier decisions.
this may involve seeking alternative plans for a particular task, re-scheduling tasks to better comply with resource constraints, dropping some tasks, or some other decision that will increase the likelihood of success [12, 14].
when failures occur, the choice of plans will be reviewed.
in agent architectures inspired by the belief-desire-intention (bdi) model [16], these properties are often characterized by the  interactions between beliefs, goals, and plans [2].1 in general, an agent that wishes to achieve a particular set of tasks will pursue a  number of plans concurrently.
accordingly, dealing with failure is fundamental to agent  programming, and is an important element of agent characteristics such as robustness, flexibility, and persistence [21].
intelligent agents generally work in complex, dynamic  environments, such as air traffic control or robot navigation, in which the success of any particular action or plan cannot be guaranteed [13].
