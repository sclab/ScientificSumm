section 5 considers the case with multiple global bidders and in section 6 we address the market efficiency.
finally, section 7 concludes. 
in section 4 we  investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise the optimal bidding behaviour for it.
in section 3 we describe the bidders and the auctions in more detail.
the remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
if the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders" strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric nash equilibrium.
section 2 discusses related work.
in fact it fluctuates between two states.
by so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the  dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure  strategy.
due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to  numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.
we then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.
• empirically, we find that a bidder"s expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.
however, for most common bidder valuation  distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required.
• finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an  arduous task when considering all possible combinations.
• we are able to prove that, even if a global bidder  requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item.
for this case, we find the following results: • whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidder"s best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it.
in more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local  bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.
within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidder"s  utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any  number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation  distribution.
however, our results generalise to settings with english auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.
we choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to  induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.
in particular, our focus is on vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.
in contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.
to date, much of the existing literature on multiple  auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on  simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).
as we will show, however, this  analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.
to this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal  bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple,  concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.
against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.
in ebay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even  thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .
the recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].
