the global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 
in view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.
as a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.
this deters bidders who are  either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.
lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.
an agent with bounded  rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.
thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.
this lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.
even if this is known,  however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple  auctions.
secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) participate in auctions that they are already familiar with.

3 note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders.
firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in english auctions such as ebay [10].
however, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.
as we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.
this uncertainty is modelled using a poisson distribution (more details are provided in section 4.1).
in the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to n, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.
in the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to n for each auction.
we consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.
local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .
the former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.
3.2 global and local bidders we distinguish between global and local bidders.
this strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders" decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations).
secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).
firstly, it is communication efficient.
this format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.
3.1 the auctions the seller"s auction is implemented as a vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.
finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders.
however, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in section 4.4. we also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).
the m auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .
each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).
the model consists of m sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.
