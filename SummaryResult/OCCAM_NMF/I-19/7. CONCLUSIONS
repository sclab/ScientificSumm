the latter arises, for example, when the number of (average) local bidders differs per auction or the auctions have different settings for parameters such as the reserve price. 
in future work, we intend to extend the results to imperfect substitutes (i.e., when a global bidder gains from winning additional items), and to settings where the auctions are no longer identical.
these results show that the way in which the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global bidder depends on the information that is available to that global bidder.
in contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency  significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items.
we show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.
finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with  multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.
for the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.
the converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.
we argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.
we find that a global bidder"s strategy does not stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market, but only converges when there are local bidders as well.
furthermore, we investigate a setting with multiple global bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation approach.
this  considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any number of auctions.
for a number of common  valuation distributions, we show analytically that the problem of finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions.
thus, a potential buyer can achieve considerable  benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an optimal bidding strategy.
for this setting, we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires a single item and derives no additional benefit from having more.
we first analyse the case where a single global bidder bids in all auctions, whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction.
in this paper, we derive utility-maximising strategies for  bidding in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions.
