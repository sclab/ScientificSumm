the  experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3, followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4. 
the rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we will introduce our clgr algorithm in detail.
the idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [31], and our  experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that clgr performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods.
so we call our method clustering with local and global regularization (clgr).
however, unlike spectral clustering, which just enforces a smoothness  constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold [2], our method first construct a regularized linear label  predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in [25], and then combine the results of all these local label  predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer.
the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.
in this paper, we propose a novel document clustering  algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering, i.e.
in this way, spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph.
after some relaxations, these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions, which is guaranteed to be global optimal.
normalized cut [22], ratio cut [7], min-max cut [11]) defined on an undirected graph.
for  example spectral clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to  optimize some cut value (e.g.
then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph.
the basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph, in which the graph nodes represent the data points, and the weights on the edges  correspond to the similarities between pairwise points.
recently, another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable  interests in the machine learning and data mining community.
in the last decades, many methods have been  proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods [19][28].
the expectation  maximization (em) algorithm) for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the  initializations.
as we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods (like kmeans and gaussian  mixture model (gmm) [16]): (1) the predefined criterion is  usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions; (2) the iterative procedure (e.g.
in this paper, we will focus on the partitioning methods.
for  instance, k-means [13] is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers.
on the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually  optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.
it takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster.
for example, hierarchical  agglomerative clustering (hac) [13] is a typical bottom-up  hierarchical clustering method.
the hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches.
generally, document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes: hierarchical methods and  partitioning methods.
in such cases, efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful.
they usually provide specified search for documents matching the user"s query, however, it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed.
traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum, i.e.
as pointed out by [8], the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months.
a good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a  meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation, which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies.
document clustering has been receiving more and more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization, automatic topic  extraction, and fast information retrieval or filtering.
