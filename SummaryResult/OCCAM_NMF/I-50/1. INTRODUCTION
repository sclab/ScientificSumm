finally, we present verification complexity results for ctlkp in section 5. 
in  section 4, properties of knowledge, belief, and plausibility are explored.
we also show how 582 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas temporal formulae can be used to describe plausible paths, and we compare our logic with existing related work.
in section 3 we present our approach to plausibility and  formally define ctlk with plausibility.
firstly, we briefly present branching-time logic with knowledge, ctlk.
the paper is structured as follows.
the latter approach is based on the more powerful logic atl [1].
while this paper deals with knowledge, plausibility, and  belief, the companion paper [11] proposes a general framework for multi-agent systems that regard game-theoretical  rationality criteria like nash equilibrium, pareto optimality, etc.
[12, 14]) it seems reasonable to split this task.
as combining all these dimensions is highly  nontrivial (cf.
our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that  allows the study of strategies, time, knowledge, and  plausible/rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect  information.
finally, we show that model checking of the new logic is no more complex than model checking ctl and ctlk.
we also show how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator, and we study properties of such updates.
finally, we show that the relationship  between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is natural and reflects the initial intuition well.
in particular, we show that knowledge is an s5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy  axioms k45 in general, and kd45 for the class of plausibly serial models.
we investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, and belief in this new framework.
restricting one"s reasoning to plausible possibilities is essential to make the reasoning feasible, as the space of all possibilities is exceedingly large in real life.
we believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility and practical beliefs quite often in their everyday  reasoning.
the main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen.
we propose a particular notion of beliefs (inspired by [20, 7]), defined in terms of epistemic relations and plausibility.
as a consequence, we obtain a language to reason about what can (or must) plausibly happen.
moreover, behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the kripke structure modeling a  multiagent system.
that is, some behaviors of the  system can be assumed plausible and others implausible, with the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be  ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action.
in our approach, plausibility can be seen as a temporal property of behaviors.
in this paper, we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior: this notion is added to the language of ctlk [19], which is a  straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic ctl [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5].
notions like time, knowledge, and beliefs are very  important for analyzing the behavior of agents and multi-agent systems.
