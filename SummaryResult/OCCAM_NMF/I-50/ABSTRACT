we also show that model checking ctlkp is ptime-complete and can be done in time linear with respect to the size of models and formulae.
in particular, we show that, for a natural class of models, belief is a kd45 modality.
furthermore, we examine some important  properties of these concepts.
a plausibility update operator is added to this logic in order to change plausibility assumptions  dynamically.
the new logic ctlkp (ctlk with plausibility) includes also a  particular notion of belief.
we address this problem and extend ctlk (computation tree logic with knowledge) with a notion of plausibility, which allows for practical and counterfactual reasoning.
in particular, they usually offer no concept for expressing that some course of events is more likely to happen than another.
logics of knowledge and belief are often too static and  inflexible to be used on real-world problems.
