we would like to thank juergen dix for fruitful  discussions, useful comments and improvements. 
as a consequence, we suggest that the framework we propose may prove suitable for modeling, design, and analysis resource-bounded agents in general.
human agents use a similar concept of plausibility and practical beliefs in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search space and make the reasoning feasible.
we would like to stress that we do not see this contribution as a mere technical exercise in formal logic.
moreover, the model checking  results from section 5 show that verification for ctlkp is no more complex than for ctl and ctlk.
that is, the relationship between knowledge and beliefs is very natural and reflects the  initial intuition precisely.
we also prove that believing in ϕ is knowing that ϕ plausibly holds in all  plausibly possible situations.
in particular, we show that knowledge is an s5 modality, and that beliefs satisfy axioms k45 in general, and kd45 for the class of plausibly serial models.
we use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility, knowledge, beliefs, and updates.
we also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility  update operator (in a way similar to [13]).
furthermore, we propose a non-standard  notion of beliefs, defined in terms of indistinguishability and plausibility.
as a technical device to define the semantics of the resulting logic, we use a non-standard satisfaction relation |=p that allows to propagate the current set of plausible paths into subformulae.
we add the new notion of plausibility to the logic of ctlk [19], and obtain a language which  enables reasoning about what can (or must) plausibly happen.
in this paper a notion of plausible behavior is considered, with the underlying idea that implausible options should be usually ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action.
