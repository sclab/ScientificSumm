similar results can be derived for other parameters, most of the effort residing in finding the exposure distributions through simulation. 
these results are specific to the region and the parameters characterizing the signal emitted by the target that were chosen for the simulation.
the last cost assignment is (cd = 100, cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achieved when deploying 27 sensors at every step.
in this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19. again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights.
the second cost assignment is (cd = 5, cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of cd/cs determines the shape of the graphs).
this is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.
for n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease.
the expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ s that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step.
overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.
since cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesn"t affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph.
the three corresponding graphs are shown in figure 6. the first cost assignment is (cd = 0, cs = 1) so that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to be used to achieve an exposure of 95%.
for this cost analysis, the region parameters and signal model are the same as specified in section 5. we further assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ s. in this case, equation 4 reduces to e{c} = (cd + n.cs) s−1 i=1 i. i−1 j=1 fj.n(ed) (1 − fi.n(ed)) + (s.cd + m.cs) s−1 j=1 fj.n(ed) (5) we evaluated the expected cost as a function of n for three different cost assignments with a desired exposure of ed = 95%.
the optimal number of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can be derived from these results.
in this section, we evaluate the expected cost of deploying sensors using the simulation results.
