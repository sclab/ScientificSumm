the  solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by  considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step and this multiple variables problem requires further  investigation. 
the results of this study can be extended to larger regions with different target parameters.
we found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to  deployment and sensors.
these results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment for varying number of sensors deployed in each step.
through simulation, the  distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random  deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed.
the cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment.
the strategy consists of deploying a  limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum exposure is achieved.
in the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in steps is developed.
the minimum exposure is used as a measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the  region.
a  mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths through the region.
this paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment in a region to be monitored for target intrusion.
