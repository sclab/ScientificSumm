in general, the optimal cost solution is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all the sensors at a time. 
in the next section, we develop analytical expressions for finding the optimal solution.
by assigning a cost to both single  sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be deployed at first and thereafter can be determined.
however, a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and  deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the cost of single sensors.
the number of sensors used in this strategy can be  minimized by deploying one sensor at a time.
if it does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the  desired exposure level is reached or until the all m available sensors are deployed.
the random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to determine if it satisfies the desired performance level.
to reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.
deploying the m sensors results in the  maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.
3.2 solution based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of m sensors can be used.
in practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate.
a study of the statistical distribution of exposure for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level is achieved.
indeed some sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability, in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same vicinity.
however, since the deployment is random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure level is achieved for a given number of sensors.
obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region.
since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.
it is  assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.
this performance is measured by the false alarm  probability and the path exposure defined in section 2. the false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.
the problem is to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired  performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the region.
the sensors are to be deployed over the region in a random fashion where the sensors  locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the number or density of sensors can be chosen.
the target to traverse the sensor field emits a given energy level k and the stochastic of the noise in the region is known.
3.1 problem formulation consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized  traversal using a sensor network.
in this section, the problem of sensor deployment for  unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are identified.
