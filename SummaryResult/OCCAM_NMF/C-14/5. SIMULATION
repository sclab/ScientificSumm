the confidence for ed when  deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the  distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 
these values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in equation 4. the graph shows that the confidence level to obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the number of sensors deployed.
the graph of figure 5 shows the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the  number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%.
we use the cumulative distribution function obtained from the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the  desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of sensors.
when deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed.
when deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a  desirable exposure level.
when  randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a placement providing a desirable minimum exposure.
the density slowly increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1. as expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases.
for deployment of 10 sensors, we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density for values below .04, then increases and has about constant density for values lying between .1 and .98. we also observe a peak of density around 1. for deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure.
5.2 distribution of minimum exposure the distribution of minimum exposure were found for the number of sensor deployed varying from 1 to 40. to  illustrate our results, the probability density functions for 5, 10 and 15 sensors are shown in figure 4. we observe that for 5 sensors deployed, the minimum  exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm probability of .04. the highest density is obtained for  values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero for higher values of exposure.

the false alarm probability for each detection attempt is chosen so that the probability to get one or more false alarm along a path of length 20 units (corresponding to 20 detection attempts by the sensors) is 5%.
the threshold for detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors to give a constant false alarm probability.
the sensors use value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision on the presence of a target in the region.
the region monitored is of size 20Ã—20 with a noise (awgn) of variance 1, so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is 8 or more units length away from a sensor.
for every deployment, the minimum exposure is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm  presented in section 2. a decay factor of k = 2 and maximum energy of k = 60 are chosen to model the energy emitted by targets (cf equation 1).
the random deployment is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the region, which is a local  approximation.
5.1 method the exposure distribution is obtained by collecting  statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a predefined region.
in this section, we present results of simulations that were conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of the number of sensors deployed.
