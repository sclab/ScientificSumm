one open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 
we will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.
the following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle  analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and  preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3.  incorporating more useful information, including photographers" and reviewers" information, to model the photos in a  heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.
in order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., web photo forums) are needed.
current system is far from being perfect.
though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on.
both the intermediate results and the user  studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to web object ranking in the  aforesaid relationships.
the proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.
we have built a vertical high-quality photo search engine, and proposed score fusion methods which can  automatically integrate as many data sources (web forums) as possible.
in this paper, we studied the web object-ranking  problem in the cases of lacking object relationships where  traditional ranking algorithms are no longer valid, and took high-quality photo search as the test bed for this  investigation.
