we  presented two variations of the budget based algorithms and through experimentation showed that the algorithms reduce the standard  deviation of the error thereby making the game more fair and at the same time has comparable mean error to the base case. 
to counter this effect, we presented budget based algorithms where the dr vectors are still  scheduled to be sent at different players at different times but the  algorithm balances the need for fairness with the requirement that the error of the worst case players (who are furthest from the sender) are not increased compared to the base case (where all dr vectors are sent to all players every time a dr vector is generated).
this algorithm is aimed at making the game fair to all players, but tends to increase the mean error of the players.
we then presented an algorithm based on scheduling the dr vectors to be sent to different players at different times thereby equalizing the error at different players.
in this paper, we first developed a model for estimating the error in rendering player trajectories at the  receivers.
there is unfair advantage gained by receivers who are closer to the sender of the dr as they are able to render the sender"s position more accurately in real time.
due to the variable delay between players, these dr vectors reach different players at different times.
in distributed multi-player games played across the internet,  object and player trajectory within the game space are exchanged in terms of dr vectors.
