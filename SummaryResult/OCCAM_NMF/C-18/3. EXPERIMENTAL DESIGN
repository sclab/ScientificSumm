the percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords were found to be shared. 
in such a topology, shared passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying percentage of passwords were shared across subnets.
for example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts.
within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were  selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets.
similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were  selected randomly across the ipv4 space, was constructed.
all shared passwords are distributed randomly across all nodes.
at the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero.
in the case of a simple local area network of 30  computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected.
the simple swarm worm described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm behaviors.
the simulator was written in c++ .
the network testbed  consisted of a local area network of 30 linux based computers.
in order to verify our hypothesis that swarm worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale internet-like topologies (ipv4 space), was developed.
