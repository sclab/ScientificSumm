; and • what techniques, if any, can be developed to create defenses against swarm worms? 
• are the current techniques being developed in the  design of intrusion detection & countermeasure  systems and survivable systems effective against this new class of worms?
some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be consider are as follows: • is it possible to apply some of learning concepts  developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way that true emergent behavior takes place?
this work opens up a new area of interesting problems.
preliminary results showed that such worms is capable of compromising hosts a rates up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than its generic counterpart while retaining stealth capabilities.
such a swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node  topology.
zachik is a  simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates  different learning and information sharing strategies.
in addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called zachik.
such swarm worms are potentially more  harmful than their generic counterparts.
swarm worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed intelligence.
the model presented in section 2 was extended to incorporate a new class of  potentially dangerous worms called swarm worms.
in this manuscript, we have presented an abstract model, similar in some aspects to that of weaver [5], that helps explain the generic nature of worms.
