finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights into future work are presented. 
in section 4, preliminary results via both empirical measurements as well as simulation is presented.
this model is used in section 2.6 to described the first instance of a swarm worm, zachik.
in section 2 an abstract model of both generic worms as well as swarm worms is presented.
the rest of this manuscript is structure as follows.
preliminary results showed that such worms are capable of  compromising hosts at rates up to two orders of magnitude faster than their generic counterpart.
such a swarm worm was  deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology.
zachik is a simple password  cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and information sharing strategies.
specifically, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called zachik.
such swarm worms are potentially more  harmful than their similar generic counterparts.
swarm worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed intelligence.
this model, which extends the work by weaver [5] is presented here in section 2. in addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of potentially dangerous worms called swarm worms.
in order to understand fully the behavior of such swarms it is necessary to construct a model that explains the  behavior of what we will call generic worms.
4. emergent intelligence: aggregate behavior of  autonomous agents results in complex intelligent  behaviors; including self-organization.
there is no central command or leader, and certainly there is no global plan.
3. distributed control: autonomous agents interact with their environment, which probably consists of other agents, but act relatively independently from all other agents.
for example, a bird in a flock senses the position of adjacent bird and applies a simple rule of avoidance and follow.
some models called this primitive actions or behaviors; 2. local communication mechanisms: agents interact with other members in the swarm via simple local communication mechanisms.
agents in the swarm use simple local rules to govern their actions.
these are: 1. simplicity of logic & actions: a swarm is composed of n agents whose intelligence is limited.
the basic concepts that have been developed over the last decade to explain swarms, and swarm behavior include four basic components.
moreover, in recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design of mobile ad-hoc networks (manets), the design of  intrusion detection systems, the study of traffic patterns in transportation systems, in military applications, and other areas, see [3].
biologists, and computer scientists in the field of  artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and 323 attempted to create models that explain how the elements of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve.
in general, this kind of aggregate motion has been called swarm  behavior.
a school of fish swims, turns, flees  together away from a predator, ands so forth.
a group of ants forages for food.
a flock of birds sweeps across the sky.
in such studies, early researchers discovered a  variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild.
the concept of emergent intelligence was first studied in association with biological systems.
specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called swarm worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence.
in the work described here, we put forth the  hypothesis that next generation worms will be different, and  therefore such techniques may have some significant limitations.
that is, systems are being designed and developed to  effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of slammer.
however, such strategies suffer from the fighting the last war syndrome.
other researchers have proposed the use of detectors where rates of  destination unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the  organization to the potential presence of a worm.
for example, zou, et al., [2], proposed a scheme where a kalman filter is used to  detect the early propagation of a worm.
since slammer, researchers have explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms.
vern paxson of the international computer science institute and lawrence berkeley national laboratory in its analysis of slammer commented: the slammer worm spread so quickly that  human response was ineffective, see [4] the interesting part, from our perspective, about the spread of slammer is that it was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior, namely self-reproduction.
within 10 minutes after the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all  vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant  disruption to the global internet infrastructure.
in the early morning hours (05:30 gmt) of january 25, 2003 the fastest computer worm in recorded history began spreading throughout the internet.
