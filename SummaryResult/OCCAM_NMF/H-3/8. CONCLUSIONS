we will investigate these problems in our future research. 
it would also be interesting to test the method on web search using user search history.
this work can be further improved on several aspects, including other methods to extract term relations, to integrate more context words in conditions and to identify query domains.
this work also shows that the language modeling framework is appropriate for integrating many contextual factors.
our experimental results strongly confirm the benefit of using contexts in ir.
we have integrated the above contextual factors, together with feedback model, in a single language model.
we showed in this paper that factors within the query are also important - they help select the appropriate term relations to apply in query expansion.
previous investigations on context focused on factors around the query.
similarly to some previous studies, we propose to model topic domains instead of the user.
in this paper, we argue that a single user profile (or model) can contain a too large variety of different topics so that new queries can be incorrectly biased.
many previous studies have investigated the integration of some contextual factors in ir models, typically by incorporating a user profile.
traditional ir approaches usually consider the query as the only element available for the user information need.
