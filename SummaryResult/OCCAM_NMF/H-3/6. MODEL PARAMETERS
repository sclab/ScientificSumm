in order to avoid being trapped at a local maximum, we started from 10 random points and the best setting is selected. 
each direction is searched in turn, until no improvement in map is observed.
we start by searching in one direction - testing all the values in that direction, while keeping the values in other directions unchanged.
the value λ=0.5 is determined to maximize the effectiveness of the baseline models (see section 7.2) on the training data: trec queries 1-50 and documents on disk 2. the mixture weights αi of component models are trained on the same training data using the following method of line search [11] to maximize the mean average precision (map): each parameter is considered as a search direction.
as the parameter λ only affects document model, we will set it to the same value in all our experiments.
there are several parameters in our model: λ in equation (2) and αi (i∈{0, dom, k, f}) in equation (3).
