we describe this in the following sections. 
the remaining problem is to construct domain models and knowledge model and to combine all the models (parameter setting).
here we can see that our strategy of enhancing the query model by contextual factors is equivalent to document re-ranking, which is used in [5][15][30].
then the document score in equation (1) is extended as follows: ( ) ∑∑∑ ∈∈ ∈ == xi ii vt xi d i qi dqscoretptpdqscore ),()|(log)|(, αθθα (4) where )|(log)|(),( d vt i qi tptpdqscore θθ∑∈ = is the score according to each component model.
we will describe the details to construct dom qθ and k qθ in section 4 and 5. given these models, we create the following final query model by interpolation: ∑∈ = xi i qiq tptp )|()|( θαθ (3) where x={0, dom, k, f} is the set of all component models and iα (with 1=∑∈xi iα ) are their mixture weights.
in this paper, f qθ is extracted using the 20 blind feedback documents.
f qθ has been used in several previous studies [16][35].
0 qθ can be created by mle.
let us use 0 qθ to denote the original query model, f qθ for the feedback model created from feedback documents, dom qθ for a domain model and k qθ for a knowledge model created by applying term relations.
in this paper, we generalize this approach and integrate more models for the query.
they are then combined through interpolation.
in these cases, we construct two models for the query: the initial query model containing only the original terms, and a new model containing the added terms.
a more complete query model by several methods have been proposed using feedback documents [16][35] or using term relations [1][10][34].
in particular, all the related and presumed words should be included in the query model.
to improve retrieval effectiveness, it is important to create a more complete query model that represents better the information need.
in such a setting, the basic retrieval operation is still limited to keyword matching, according to a few words in the query.
in the basic language modeling approaches, the query model is estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (mle) without any smoothing.
smoothing on document model is recognized to be crucial [35], and one of common smoothing methods is the jelinek-mercer interpolation smoothing: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )cdd tptptp θλθλθ ||1'| +−= (2) where λ is an interpolation parameter and θc the collection model.
in the language modeling framework, a typical score function is defined in kl-divergence as follows: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )dq vt dq kltptpdqscore θθθθ |||log|, −∝= ∑∈ (1) where θd is a (unigram) language model created for a document d, θq a language model for the query q, and v the vocabulary.
