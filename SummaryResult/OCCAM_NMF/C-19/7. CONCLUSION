a prototype implementation allowed us to validate our ideas. 
it allows us to: (1) model accurately protocol interactions, (2) reduce the risk of errors during the composition phase, and (3) simply implement dynamic protocol updates.
we believe that the service-based  framework has several advantages over event-based frameworks.
in the paper, we proposed a new approach to the protocol composition that is based on the notion of service interface, instead of events.
