categories and subject descriptors c.2.4 [computer-communication networks]:  distributed applications 
we then describe an experimental  implementation of a service-based protocol framework in java.
it also facilitates advanced features in the design of protocols, such as dynamic update of  distributed protocols.
we argue that an alternative approach, that is based on service abstraction, is more suitable for  expressing modular protocols.
the most common approach uses events as the main abstraction for a local interaction between  protocol modules.
in this paper we compare two approaches to the design of protocol frameworks - tools for implementing modular  network protocols.
