since topic is a relative coarse-grained news cluster, we also want to refine cluster granularity to event-level, and identify different events and their relations within a topic.
for the future work, we want to collect news set which span for a longer period from internet, and integrate time information in ned task.
we did not consider news time information as a clue for ned task, since most of the topics last for a long time and tdt data sets only span for a relative short period (no more than 6 months).
our experimental results on tdt2 and tdt3 datasets show that both of the two extensions contribute significantly to improvement in accuracy.
and the second extension to basic tf-idf model is better use of term types (named entities types and part-of-speed) according to news categories.
the first extension is made by adjust term weights based on term distributions between the whole corpus and a cluster story set.
we also have presented two extensions to the basic tf-idf model.
it reduces comparing times to about one seventh of traditional method without hurting ned accuracy.
we have proposed a news indexing-tree based detection procedure in our model.
