minimum normalized cost can be determined if optimal threshold on the score were chosen.
confidence scores can be used to plot det curve, i.e., curves that plot false alarm vs. miss probabilities.
the second part is a score indicating confidence of the first decision.
the first part is yes or no indicating whether the story triggers a new event or not.
the cost cdet is normalized such that a perfect system scores 0 and a trivial system, which is the better one of mark all stories as new or old, scores 1: ( ( * , * ) ) det det miss target fa nontarget c norm c min c p c p = (13) new event detection system gives two outputs for each story.
6.2 evaluation metric tdt uses a cost function cdet that combines the probabilities of missing a new story and a false alarm [19]: * * * *det miss miss target fa fa nontargetc c p p c p p= + (12) table 2. average correlation between term types and news classes where cmiss means the cost of missing a new story, pmiss means the probability of missing a new story, and ptarget means the probability of seeing a new story in the data; cfa means the cost of a false alarm, pfa means the probability of a false alarm, and pnontarget means the probability of seeing an old story.
all the topics are classified into 11 rules of interpretation: (1)elections, (2)scandals/hearings, (3)legal/criminal cases, (4)natural disasters, (5)accidents, (6)ongoing violence or war, (7)science and discovery news, (8)finance, (9)new law, (10)sports news, (11)misc.
tdt3 dataset is labeled with about 120 topics, and approximately 8000 english stories belong to at least one of these topics.
tdt2 dataset is labeled with about 100 topics, and approximately 12,000 english stories belong to at least one of these topics.
we used transcribed versions of the tv and radio broadcasts besides textual news.
tdt3 contains approximately 31,000 english stories collected from october to december 1998. in addition to the sources used in tdt2, it also contains stories from nbc and msnbc tv broadcasts.
only english stories in the collection were considered.
tdt2 contains news stories from january to june 1998. it contains around 54,000 stories from sources like abc, associated press, cnn, new york times, public radio international, voice of america etc.
6.1 datasets we used two ldc [18] datasets tdt2 and tdt3 for our experiments.
