we conclude in section 7. 
in section 3 we present our notation for a  single dimensional contract, before introducing our multi-dimensional trust model in section 4. in sections 5 and 6 we discuss  communicating reputation, and present our solution to rumour propagation in decentralised reputation systems.
the remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work.
we show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence.
thus, we present a novel solution based upon the idea of private and shared  information.
4. we show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of  contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and rumour  propagation, in decentralised reputation systems.
the sufficient statistics represent  aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information.
3. we show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another.
we then benchmark this  solution and show that it leads to good estimates.
2. we present an exact probabilistic model based upon the  dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct  experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above.
in more detail, in this paper we extend the state of the art in four key ways: 1. we devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a  contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract  dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the  correlations between these estimates.
building upon this, we then devise a novel trust model that addresses the three desiderata discussed above.

here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 in this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors.
the starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.
to rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a  probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with  correlated multi-dimensional contracts.
to date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).
thus, correlations will  naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the  probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract  dimension.
a supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.
for example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.
furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.
this presents the  challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.
however, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].
whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).
whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e.
in particular: (i) it  allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a  natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this  trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.
this  approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.
recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].
to date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).
in such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.
the role of computational models of trust within multi-agent  systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has  recently generated a great deal of research interest.
