however, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated  sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 
finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as jøsang and ismail, and teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering  inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.
again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply  aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.
for instance, in the case of three dimensions, n, is given by: n =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.
a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, n, which are the sufficient statistics of the dirichlet distribution, given by: n =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).
in this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e.
we can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the  sufficient statistics of the dirichlet distribution instead of the beta  distribution.
under the probabilistic framework of the beta  distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agent"s own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.
this approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract  outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of  contracts observed, n, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).
present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient  statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11].
both jøsang and ismail, and teacy et al.
this is commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) ity that a multi-dimensional contract will be successfully fulfilled, we now go on to consider how agents within an open multi-agent system can communicate these estimates to one another.
