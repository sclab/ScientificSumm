by adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed n previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 n + 2 and: var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(n − n + 1) (n + 2)2(n + 3) note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 
now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta  distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3].
[11].
the utility based approach that we present here provides an  attractive motivation for this model of teacy et al.
these two properties are given by: e[e[u]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) var(e[u]) = var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) where ˆp(o = 1) and var(p(o = 1)) are the estimate and  uncertainty of the probability that a contract will be successfully  fulfilled, and are calculated from the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) that the agent determines from its direct experience.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) 1071 not only on its estimate of the expected utility of the contract, but also on the probability that the expected utility will exceed some minimum amount.

4 note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].
3 clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is  derived from an unsuccessful outcome.
this uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work.
given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, e[e[u]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, var(e[u]).
the best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.
however, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not.
now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, e[u], and this is given by: e[u] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.
we assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 .
in order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should  consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.
this contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 .
we consider an agent who must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier.
before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first  introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case.
