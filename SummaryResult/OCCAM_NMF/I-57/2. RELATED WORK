however, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta  distribution, namely the dirichlet distribution, to represent the agent"s belief over multiple dimensions. 
in the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per jøsang and ismail and teacy et al.).
we show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must  estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.
however, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.
our work builds upon these more principled approaches.
thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.
they provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always  truthfully report their trust estimates.
they present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.
use the beta distribution to describe an agent"s belief in the probability that another agent will  successfully fulfill its commitments [11].
likewise, teacy et al.
moreover, they  provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an  approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient  statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.
the beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.
jøsang and ismail describe the beta reputation system whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].
by contrast, a number of researchers have presented more  principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.
nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.
these estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.
they define  multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a supplier"s estimated behaviour.
take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5].
gujral et al.
whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated  confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.
he develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.
in his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic  meaning.
likewise, griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and  quality [4].
they  provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.
sabater and sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple  variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.
the need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers.
