our results are summarized in figure 1 (see the caption for a summary). 
we thus introduce a new online trading model  incorporating limit order books, and examine both the one-way and vwap trading problems in it.
such data and algorithms are a topic of great current interest on wall street [4].
while limit order books (the list of limit orders awaiting possible future execution) have existed since the dawn of equity exchanges, only very  recently have these books become visible to traders in real time, thus opening the way to trading algorithms of all  varieties that attempt to exploit this rich market microstructure data.
briefly, a limit buy or sell order specifies both the number of shares and the desired price, and will only be executed if there is a matching party on the opposing side, according to a well-defined matching procedure used by all the major exchanges.
our most interesting results, however, examine the vwap trading problem in a new online trading model capturing the important recent phenomenon of limit order books in  financial markets.
in this model, we provide vwap algorithms and competitive ratios, and  compare this setting with the one-way trading (owt) problem studied in [3].
we first formalize the vwap trading problem in a basic online model we call the price-volume model, which can be viewed as a generalization of previous theoretical online trading models incorporating market volume information.
in this paper, we provide the first study of vwap trading algorithms in an online, competitive ratio setting.
however, in the vwap setting, considering a restriction on the maximum to the minimum volume fluctuation q, leads to an additional class of results which depends on q. and some small companies focus exclusively on proprietary vwap trading technology.
all the results for the owt trading criterion (which is a stronger criterion) directly translate to the vwap criterion.
(see section 4 for a description of the macroscopic distribution model.)
the parameter r represents a bound on the maximum to the minimum price fluctuation and the parameter q represents a bound on the maximum to minimum volume fluctuation in the respective model.
the entry in the table is the competitive ratio between our algorithm and an optimal algorithm, and the closer the ratio is to 1 the better.
the columns represent which model we are working in.
the rows represent results for either the owt or vwap criterion.

the importance of the vwap has led to many automated vwap trading algorithms -  indeed, every major brokerage has at least one vwap box, 189 price volume model order book model macroscopic distribution model owt θ(log(r)) (from[3]) o(log(r) log(n)) 2e(pbins maxprice ) 2(1 + )e(pbins maxprice ) for -approx of pbins maxprice θ(log(q)) (same as above plus...) vwap θ(log(r)) o(log(r) log(n)) (from above) 2e(pbins vol ) ω(q) fixed schedule o(log(q)) for large n (1 + )2e(pbins vol ) for -approx.
such small-margin, high-volume profits can be extremely  lucrative for a large brokerage.
if they can beat the vwap by a penny, they make two cents per share.
the brokerage now has a very clean challenge: by selling the shares themselves over the next month in a way that exactly matches the vwap, a penny per share is earned in profits.
the usual answer is that the brokerage offers to buy the shares from the fund manager at a per-share price tied to the vwap over some future period - in our example, the brokerage might offer to buy the 1% at a per-share price of the  coming month"s vwap minus 1 cent.
paying the price on the day of the sale is too risky for the brokerage, as they need to sell the shares themselves over an extended period, and events beyond their control (such as wars) could cause the price to fall dramatically.
the brokerage will typically alleviate the fund manager"s problem immediately by simply buying the shares directly from the fund manager, and then selling them off  laterbut what price should the brokerage pay the fund manager?
thus, the fund manager would approach brokerages for help in selling the 1%.
typically, such a fund manager would be unqualified to sell such a large number of shares in the open market - it requires a  professional broker to intelligently break the trade up over time, and possibly over multiple exchanges, in order to minimize the market impact of such a sizable transaction.
(such a decision might be forced by the fund"s own regulations or other considerations.)
suppose a very large mutual fund holds 3% of the outstanding shares of a large, publicly traded company - a huge fraction of the shares - and that this fund"s  manager decides he would like to reduce this holding to 2% over a 1-month period.
a typical scenario goes as follows.
very large institutional trades constitute one of the main motivations behind vwap activity.
in vwap trading, one attempts to buy or sell a fixed number of shares at a price that closely tracks the vwap.
informally, the vwap of a stock over a specified market period is simply the average price paid per share during that period, so the price of each transaction in the market is weighted by its volume.
one of the most common activities in modern financial markets is known as volume weighted average price, or vwap, trading.
the constraints often derive from a complex combination of business,  regulatory and institutional issues, and result in certain kinds of standard trading strategies or criteria that invite  algorithmic analysis.
while popular images of wall street often depict  swashbuckling traders boldly making large gambles on just their market intuitions, the vast majority of trading is actually considerably more technical and constrained.
