surprisingly some difficult boolean formulas are  better learned, given the same learning set, by a multi agent system than by a single agent.
the resulting method smile (standing for sound  multiagent incremental learning) is described and experimented here.
the  corresponding protocol is applied to supervised concept learning.
we extend this notion of consistency (or soundness) to the whole mas and  discuss how to obtain that, at any moment, a same consistent concept representation is present in each agent.
here each agent can update incrementally its beliefs b (the concept representation) so that it is in a way kept consistent with the whole set of information k (the examples) that he has received from the environment or other agents.
this article deals with the problem of collaborative  learning in a multi-agent system.
