part of this work has been performed during the first author"s visit to the atelier de bioinformatique of paris vi university, france. 
aknowledgments we are very grateful to dominique bouthinon for  implementing late modifications in smile, so much easing our experiments.
further work concerns first coupling induction and abduction in order to perform collaborative concept learning when  examples are only partially observed by each agent, and second, investigating partial memory learning: how learning is  preserved whenever one agent or the whole mas forgets some selected examples.
in [1], a similar approach has been applied to mas abduction problems: the hypotheses to maintain, given an incomplete information, are then facts or statements.
for instance if we introduce a timeout mechanism, even when a critic agent crashes or omits to answer, the consistency with the other critics (within the remaining agents) is  entailed.
nevertheless, our framework is open, i.e., the agents can leave the system or enter it while the consistency mechanism is preserved.
the hypotheses of our experiments do not address the issues of distributed mas such as faults (for  instance messages could be lost or corrupted) or other failures in general (crash, byzantine faults, etc.).
the main feature of this  collaborative learning mechanism is that it maintains a  consistency property: though during the learning process each agent only receives and stores, with some limited  redundancy, part of the examples received by the mas, at any moment the current hypothesis is consistent with the whole set of examples.
we have presented here and experimented a protocol for mas online concept learning.
