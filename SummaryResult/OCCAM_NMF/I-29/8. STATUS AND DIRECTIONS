finally, we plan to explore the use of more advanced stn-driven coordination mechanisms,  including the use of temporal decoupling [7] to insulate the actions of inter-dependent agents and the introduction of probability sensitive contingency schedules. 
to better address the problem of establishing inter-agent synchronization points, we expanding the use of task owners and qaf-specifc protocols as a means for  directing coordination activity.
to provide more global perspective to local scheduling  decisions, we are introducing mechanisms for computing,  communicating and using estimates of the non-local impact of remote nodes.
to fully address various scale up issues, we are  investigating a number of more advanced coordination mechanisms.
in addition to verifying that the performance on year 1  problems is matched or exceeded, we have recently run some successful tests with the agent on a few 100 agent problems.
we have recently completed a re-implementation of the prototype agent  designed to address some recognized performance issues.
this scale places much higher computational  demands on all of the agent"s components.
year 2 programmatic evaluation goals call for solving problems on the order of 100 agents and 10,000 methods.
our current research efforts are aimed at extending the  capabilities of the year 1 agent and scaling up to significantly larger problems.
