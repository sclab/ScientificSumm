unlike the spectrum architecture which allows edge devices to operate in a largely autonomous fashion, the  vendor solutions typically are more tightly coupled to a centralized controller and do not have the sophisticated time-based operations offered by spectrum. 
cisco and netapp) have developed and implemented content management products and tools.
finally, in the commercial cdn environment vendors (e.g.
in the case where spectrum is used in a pvr  configuration this type of system would perform a higher level function and could clearly benefit from the functionalities of the spectrum architecture.
[6].
other related work involves so called tv recommendation  systems which are used in pvrs to automatically select content for users, e.g.
this has allowed us to easily implement and experiment with a prototype system.
after carefully considering the required functionality to implement content management in the networked environment, we have partitioned the system into three simple functions, namely content manager, policy manager and storage manager.
our work differs in that we are considering more than the policy management aspects of the problem.
simulation is used to compare the proposed scheme with well-known replacement algorithms.
the cache knowledge base allows sophisticated policies to be  employed.
the authors construct a system employing various components, such as a central router, cache knowledge base, subcaches, and a subcache eviction judge.
in [1] content is distributed among sub-caches.
the  performance of the scheme is benchmarked via simulation.
content is distributed among server resources in proportion to user demand using a demand dissemination protocol.
for example in [5], the problem of serving multimedia content via distributed servers is  considered.
much of the work focuses on the policy management aspect.
several authors have addressed the problem of the management of content in distributed networks.
