once again, conflict is apparent, with the influence of α substantially lessened when overlap is considered. 
figure 8 plots values of the inex-2003 map metric for two quantizations, with and without consideration of overlap.
the map values at one extreme (α = 0.0) and the xcg value at the other extreme (α = 1.0) represent retrieval performance comparable to the best systems at inex 2004 [8,12].
are plotted for values of α between 0.0 and 1.0. recalling that the xcg metric is designed to penalize overlap, while the inex-2002 metric ignores overlap, the conflict between the metrics is obvious.

figure 7 plots the three variants of inex-2002 map metric together with the xcg metric.
values for the xcg metrics were computed using software supplied by its inventors [11].
the inex evaluation packages (inex_eval and inex_eval_ng) were used to  compute values for the inex-2002 and inex-2003 metrics.
nonetheless, when taken together they provide insight into the  behaviour of the re-ranking algorithm.
none of the metrics described in section 3.3 is a close fit with the view of overlap advocated by this paper.
