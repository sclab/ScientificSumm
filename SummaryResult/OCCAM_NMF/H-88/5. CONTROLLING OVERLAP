in section 8 the algorithm is extended to apply increasing weights, lowering the score, when a term appears in more than one reported element. 
the algorithm is evaluated experimentally in section 7. one limitation of the algorithm is that the contribution of terms appearing in reported elements is reduced by the same  factor regardless of the number of reported elements in which it appears.
the next section presents and  analysis a simple re-ranking algorithm that follows this strategy.
translating this approach to our context, the  contribution of terms appearing in elements is dynamically reduced as they are reported.
in equation 1, xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt, where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and zt is the number of times t occurs in the body.
instead, they apply the weights at the term frequency level, with an occurrence of a query term t in the title making a greater contribution to the score than an occurrence in the body.
discuss the theoretical flaws in this approach and demonstrate experimentally that it can actually harm  retrieval effectiveness.
robertson et al.
a common approach to this problem scores the title and body separately and  generates a final score as a linear combination of the two.
that work considers the problem of assigning different weights to different document fields, such as the title and body associated with web pages.
[20] argue strongly against the linear combination of okapi scores in this  fashion.
in a related context, robertson et al.
for example, assume a paragraph with score p is reported in step 1. in step 2, the section  containing the paragraph might then have its score s lowered by an amount α · p to reflect the reduced contribution the paragraph should make to the section"s score.
one approach to adjusting the scores of unreported elements in step 2 might be based on the okapi bm25 scores of the involved elements.
3. repeat steps 1 and 2 until m elements are reported.
2. adjust the scores of the unreported elements.
at a conceptual level, re-ranking proceeds as  follows: 1. report the highest ranking element.
starting with an element ranking generated by the  baseline method described in the previous section, elements are re-ranked to control overlap by iteratively adjusting the scores of those elements containing or contained in higher ranking elements.
