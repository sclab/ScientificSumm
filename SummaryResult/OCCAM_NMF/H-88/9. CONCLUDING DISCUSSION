we are also re-evaluating our approach to document statistics and examining  appropriate adjustments to the k1 parameter as term weights change [20]. 
at waterloo, we continue to develop and test our ideas for inex 2005. in particular, we are investigating methods for learning the α and βj weights.
while this style of user interface may help a user cope with overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be applicable, by determining the best elements to include in each cluster.
for example, when xml retrieval results are presented to users it may be desirable to cluster structurally related elements together, visually illustrating the relationships between them.
other approaches may also help to control overlap.
the algorithm presented in this paper controls overlap by  weighting the terms occurring in reported elements to reflect their reduced importance.
for example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element, both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship.
when generating retrieval results over an xml collection, some overlap in the results should be tolerated, and may be beneficial.
