since m ≤ h and m ≤ n, the time complexity is also o(nh log n). 
the down  routine does not report its argument, but instead recomputes its score and adds it back into s. a node cannot be an argument to down more than m +1 times, which in turn implies an overall time complexity of o((nm + mh) log n).
the up routine returns immediately (line 2) if its argument has already been reported, since term frequencies have already been adjusted in its ancestors.
the weight to be applied to the node by adjusting the value of xt in equation 1, as follows: xt = βx.j · (ft − α · gt) (3) where ft and gt are the components of x.f and x.g  corresponding to term t. a few additional changes are required to extend up and down.
when computing the score of node, the value of x.j selects 1 up(x, y) ≡ 2 if not y.reported then 3 s.remove(y) 4 y.g ← y.g + x.f − x.g 5 recompute y.score 6 s.add(y) 8 if y is not a root node then 9 up (x, y.parent) 10 end if 11 end if 12 13 down(x) ≡ 14 if x.j < m then 15 x.j ← x.j + 1 16 if not x.reported then 17 s.remove(x) 18 recompute x.score 19 s.add(x) 20 end if 21 foreach y ∈ x.children do 22 down (y) 23 end do 24 end if figure 9: extended tree traversal routines.
one extra field is required in each node, as follows: x.j - down count the value of x.j is initially set to zero in all nodes and is incremented each time down is called with x as its argument.
figure 9 presents replacements for the up and down  routines of figure 6, incorporating this series of weights.
however, in practice m is likely to be relatively small (perhaps 3 or 4).
note that an upper bound on m is h, the maximum height of any xml tree in the collection.
motivated by these observations, the re-ranking algorithm may be extended with a series of weights 1 = β0 ≥ β1 ≥ β2 ≥ ... ≥ βm ≥ 0. where βj is the weight applied to a node that has been a descendant of a reported node j times.
since the user may now have seen this paragraph twice, its score should be further lowered by increasing the value of the weight.
for example, a paragraph may form part of a reported section and then form part of a reported article.
furthermore, the same weight is used regardless of the number of times an element is contained in a reported element.
an obvious extension is to use different weights in these two cases.
one limitation of the re-ranking algorithm is that a single weight α is used to adjust the scores of both the ancestors and descendants of reported elements.
