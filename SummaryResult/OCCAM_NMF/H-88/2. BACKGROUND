many of these metrics are applied to evaluate the experiments reported in this paper, and they are briefly outlined in the next section.

kazai et al.
while  substantial progress has been made, these problem are still not completely solved.
overlap causes considerable problems with retrieval  evaluation, and the inex organizers and participants have  wrestled with these problems since the beginning.
the research described in this paper, as well as much of the related work it cites, depends on the test collections developed by inex.
over 50 groups participated in inex 2004, and the conference has become as influential in the area of xml ir as trec is in other ir areas.
inex is an  experimental conference series, similar to trec, with groups from different institutions completing one or more  experimental tasks using their own tools and systems, and  comparing their results at the conference itself.
2.3 evaluation methodology over the past three years, the initiative for the  evaluation of xml retrieval (inex) has encouraged research into xml information retrieval technology [7,8].
standard  document components such as paragraphs, sections, subsections, and abstracts usually meet these requirements; titles,  italicized phrases, and individual metadata fields often do not.
an effective xml ir system must return only those elements that have sufficient content to be usable and are able to stand alone as independent objects [15,18].
other elements may reflect the document"s physical, rather than logical,  structure, which may have little or no meaning to a user.
for example, a section title containing only the query terms may receive a high score from a ranking  algorithm, but alone it would be of limited value to a user, who might prefer the actual section itself.
this is usually the case when elements contain very little text [10].
2.2 retrievable elements while an xml ir system might potentially retrieve any element, many elements may not be appropriate as retrieval results.
it is not appropriate to compute inverse document frequency under the assumption that the term is contained in all of these elements, since the number of elements that contain a term depends entirely on the structural arrangement of the documents [13,23].
if we consider this collection to include all elements that might be returned by the system, a specific occurrence of a term may appear in several different documents, perhaps in elements  representing a paragraph, a subsection, a section and an article.
inverse document frequency) computed over the collection as a whole.
in addition, most ranking techniques require global statistics (e.g.
when applying standard relevance ranking techniques in the context of xml ir, a natural approach is to treat each element as a separate document, with term statistics  available for each [16].
depending on the application, this term might be interpreted to encompass many different objects, including web pages, newspaper articles and email messages.
2.1 term and document statistics in traditional information retrieval applications the  standard unit of retrieval is taken to be the document.
other ir research has  considered mixed queries, in which both content and structural requirements are specified [2,6,14,17,23].
we assume that these queries indicate only the nature of desired content, not its structure, and that the role of the ir system is to determine which elements best satisfy the underlying information need.
here, we take a content oriented ir perceptive, focusing on xml  documents that primarily contain natural language data and queries that are primarily expressed in natural language.
much research in the area of xml retrieval views it from a traditional database perspective, being concerned with such problems as the implementation of structured query  languages [5] and the processing of joins [1].
this section provides a general overview of xml  information retrieval and discusses related work, with an emphasis on the fundamental problems mentioned in the introduction.
