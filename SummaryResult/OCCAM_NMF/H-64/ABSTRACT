in statistical and user-based studies, human-created keywords provide significant improvements in concept learning over both title-only and full-text representations.
the current study compares concept learning strategies based on three document representations: keywords, titles, and full-text.
second, automatically derived  documentconcept relationships are a necessary precondition for  realworld deployment of many dynamic interfaces.
first we desire a practical aid for  information architects.
the goal of this discovery is twofold.
under the auspices of the govstat project, our goal is to identify a small number of semantically valid concepts that adequately spans the intellectual domain of a collection.
this paper describes ongoing research into the application of machine learning techniques for improving access to  governmental information in complex digital libraries.
