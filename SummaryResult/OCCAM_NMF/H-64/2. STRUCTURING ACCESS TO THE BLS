in light of this potential for confusion and the agency"s own  request for redesign, we undertook the task of topic discovery described in the following sections. 
thus the listing of the producer price index under three categories could be confusing to the site"s users.
however, the documents in this very shallow classificatory structure are almost all gateways to more specific  information.
topical redundancy is not in itself problematic.
this fact suggests a high degree of redundancy among the topics.
the four largest eigenvlaues account for 62.2% of the total variance in the data.
what is surprising about figure 3, however, is the precipitous decline in  magnitude among the first four eigenvalues.

[11]).
to analyze the redundancy inherent in the pre-existing  structure, we derived the principal components of m (cf.
based on this hyperlink structure, we defined m, a symmetric 65×65 matrix, where mij counts the number of topics in which  documents i and j are both classified on the bls home page.
altogether, the link structure of this  classificatory system contains 65 documents; that is, excluding navigational links, there are 65 documents linked from the bls home page, where each hyperlink connects a document to a topic (pages can be linked to multiple topics).
thus there are 7 pages associated with inflation.
the bls topics comprise a shallow classificatory  structure; each of the 15 top-level categories is linked to a small number of related pages.
the agents" misgivings were borne out in subsequent  analysis.
the bls agents suggested that re-designing this classification structure would be desirable.
in other words, the topics reflected official divisions rather than semantic clusters.
their form, it was argued, owed as much to the institutional structure of bls as it did to the inherent topology of the website"s information space.
in personal meetings, bls officials voiced dissatisfaction with the  existing topics.
however, this approach proved unsatisfactory.
152 figure 2: the bls home page we hoped initially that these pre-defined categories could be used to train a 15-way document classifier, thus  automating the process of populating the relation browser altogether.
these include topics such as employment and unemployment, productivity, and inflation and spending.
as seen in figure 2, the bls home page organizes 65 top-level documents into 15 categories.
2.2 a pre-existing structure prior to our involvement with the project, designers at bls created a shallow classificatory structure for the most important documents in their website.
given a collection of over 15,000 documents, these  hurdles are especially daunting, and automatic methods of  approaching them are highly desirable.
this presents two stumbling blocks for system designers: • information architects must define the appropriate set of topics for their collection • site maintainers must classify each document into its appropriate categories these tasks parallel common problems in the metadata community: defining appropriate elements and marking up documents to support metadata-aware information access.
but successful implementations of the relation browser also rely on topical classification.
as marchionini and brunk discuss, capturing the  publication date and format of documents is trivial.
finally, they might request to see only documents published in pdf format.
within this subset of the collection, they might further eliminate documents published more than a year ago.
thus in  fig3 http://www.fedstats.gov figure 1: relation browser prototype ure 1, users might limit their search set to those documents about energy.
its motivation is in keeping with shneiderman"s suggestion that queries and their results should be tightly coupled [2].
the relation browser supports information seeking by  allowing users to form queries in a stepwise fashion, slicing and re-slicing the data as their interests dictate.
in figure 1 we see a prototype instantiation of the relation browser, applied to the fedstats website3 .
the  relation browser allows users to traverse complex data sets by iteratively slicing the data along several topics.
2.1 the relation browser the starting point of this work is the notion that access to information in the bls website could be improved by the addition of a dynamic interface such as the relation browser described by marchionini and brunk [13].
with over 15,000 text/html documents (and many more documents if spreadsheets and typeset reports are included), providing access to the collection provides a steep challenge to  information architects.
the agency"s website acts as a clearinghouse for this process.
given this broad mandate, the bls publishes a wide array of  information, intended for diverse audiences.
