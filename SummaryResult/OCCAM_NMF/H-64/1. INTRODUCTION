finally, we conclude in section 7 by  outlining upcoming work on the project. 
section 6 describes a two-part evaluation of the derived  conceptual structures.
next (sections 3-5), we turn to a description of the concepts derived via content clustering under three document representations: keyword, title only, and full-text.
this section also describes evidence that this structure leaves room for  improvement.
in  section 2 we describe the previously existing, human-created conceptual structure of the bls website.
the remainder of this paper describes the details of our concept discovery efforts and subsequent evaluation.
thus we hope to learn an additional set of concepts by letting the data speak for themselves.
although bls designers have defined high-level subject headings for their collections, as we  discuss in section 2, this scheme is less than optimal.
but strictly supervised techniques [5] are inappropriate, too.
a pure document clustering [12] approach to such a large, diverse collection as bls led to poor results in early tests [6].
our approach combines supervised and unsupervised  learning techniques.
statistical learning  technologies are appealing in this context insofar as they stand to define a data-driven-as opposed to an  agency-drivennavigational structure for a site.
by analyzing the distribution of terms across documents, our goal is to supplement the agency"s pre-existing information structures.
the goal of the present 1 http://www.ils.unc.edu/govstat 2 http://www.bls.gov 151 research is to develop another means of browsing the content of these collections.
many digital libraries already make use of content classification, both explicitly and implicitly; they divide their resources manually by topical relation; they organize content into  hierarchically oriented file systems.
[13]).
the project goal is to classify the site"s web content  according to these inferred concepts as an initial step towards data filtering via active user interfaces (cf.
in  particular, our work analyzes a particular digital library-the website of the bureau of labor statistics2 (bls)-in efforts to discover a small number of linguistically meaningful  concepts, or bins, that collectively summarize the semantic domain of the site.
to enable such models and interfaces, we propose a data-driven approach, based on data mining and machine learning techniques.
citing end-user difficulty in finding governmental information (especially statistical data) online, the project seeks to  create an integrated model of user access to us government statistical information that is rooted in realistic data  models and innovative user interfaces.
the govstat project is a joint effort of the university of north carolina interaction design lab and the  university of maryland human-computer interaction lab1 .
