section 7 contains the simulation studies that largely confirm our theoretical findings on inet market data. 
section 6 presents specific examples establishing the  worstcase instability of the relative model.
this theorem is applied in section 5 to derive a number of strong stability properties in the absolute model.
section 4 presents our most important  theoretical results, the 1-modification theorem for the absolute price model.
in section 3 we describe the limit order mechanism and our formal models.
in section 2 we briefly review the large literature on market microstructure.
the outline of the paper follows.
similarly, in a purely or largely relative-price world, backtesting even low-frequency, low-volume strategies could result in historical estimates of performance that are not only unrelated to future  performance (the usual concern), but are not even accurate  measures of a hypothetical past.
our results and the fact that in the real markets there is a large and increasing amount of relative behavior such as penny-jumping would seem to cast doubts on such beliefs.
they suggest that one"s confidence that trading quietly and in small  volumes will have minimal market impact is linked to an  implicit belief in an absolute price model.
in addition to stability being of fundamental interest in any important dynamical system, we believe that the  results described here provide food for thought on the  topics of market impact and the backtesting of quantitative trading strategies (the attempt to determine hypothetical past performance using historical data).
the theoretical predictions of stability and instability are strongly borne out by the subsequent  experiments.
using  extensive inet (a major ecn for nasdaq stocks) limit order data and order book reconstruction code, we investigate the empirical stability properties when the data is interpreted as containing either absolute prices, relative prices, or  mixtures of the two.
after giving specific (worst-case) relative price sequences in which small perturbations  generate large changes in basic statistics (for example, altering the number of shares traded by a factor of two), we proceed to demonstrate that the difference in stability properties of the two models is more than merely theoretical.
in contrast, we show that the relative model enjoys no such stability properties.
we then show that this implies that for almost any standard statistic of market  activity - the executed volume, the average price execution price, and many others - the statistic can be influenced only infinitesimally by small perturbations.
in particular, we define a natural notion of distance between order books and show that small  modifications can result in only constant distance to the original books for all subsequent time steps.
we first show that for any fixed sequence of prices in the  absolute model, the modification of a single order has a bounded and extremely limited impact on the subsequent evolution of the books.
our main results demonstrate that these two models do indeed have dramatically different stability properties.
it seems possible that a small perturbation could (for example) slightly  modify the current bid, which in turn could slightly modify the price of the next arriving order, which could then slightly modify the price of the subsequent order, and so on, leading to an amplifying sequence of events.
for the relative model this intuition is less clear.
intuitively, in the absolute model a small perturbation in the arriving limit price sequence should have limited (but still some) effects on the subsequent evolution of the order books, since prices are determined independently.
the differences arise when we consider the stability question introduced above.
clearly, given any fixed sequence of arriving limit order prices, we can choose to  express these prices either as their original (absolute) values, or we can run the order book dynamical process and  transform each order into a relative difference with the top of its book, and obtain identical results.
how do these two models differ?
we remark that an alternate view of the two models is that all traders behave in a relative manner, but with absolute traders able to act only on a considerably slower time scale than the faster relative traders.
note that such positioning may depend on more complex features of the order books than just the current bid and ask, but the relative model is a natural and simplified starting point.
more generally, the entire area of modern execution optimization [9, 10, 8] has come to rely heavily on the careful positioning of limit orders relative to the current order book state.
a common example of such strategic  behavior is known as penny-jumping on wall street, in which a trader who has in interest in buying shares quickly, but still at a discount to placing a market order, will  deliberately position their order just above the current bid.
the relative price model can be viewed as modeling traders who, in addition to perhaps incorporating fundamental  external information on the stock, may also position their  orders strategically relative to the other orders on their side of the book.
again, in addition to now depending on the state of the order books, prices may also depend on all manner of exogenous information.
thus, a buyer would encode their limit order price as an offset ∆ (which may be positive, negative, or zero) from the current bid pb, which is then translated to the limit price pb +∆.
in contrast, in the relative price model, traders express their limit order prices relative to the best price offered in their respective book (buy or sell).
this process models traditional fundamentals-based trading, in which market participants each have some inherent but possibly varying valuation for the good that in turn determines their limit price.
in the  absolute price model, buyers and sellers arrive with limit order prices that are determined independently of the current state of the market (as represented by the order books), though they may depend on all manner of exogenous information or shocks, such as time, news events, announcements from the company whose shares are being traded, private signals or state of the individual traders, etc.
to examine this question, we consider two stylized but natural models of the limit order arrival process.
specifically, we are  interested in the following natural question: to what extent are simple models of limit order markets either susceptible or immune to butterfly effects - that is, the infliction of large changes in important activity statistics (such as the 120 number of shares traded or the average price per share) by only minor perturbations of the order sequence?
in this paper we investigate a previously unexplored but fundamental aspect of limit order microstructure: the  stability properties of the dynamics.
the opportunities and needs span the range from the optimized execution of large trades to the creation of stand-alone proprietary strategies that attempt to profit from high-frequency microstructure signals.
it is fair to say that market microstructure, as this area is generally known, is a topic commanding great interest both in the real markets and in the academic finance  literature.
with this revelation has come the opportunity - and increasingly, the  needfor modeling and exploiting limit order data and  dynamics.
while traders have always been able to view the prices at the top of the buy and sell books (known as the bid and ask), a relatively recent development in  certain exchanges is the real-time revelation of the entire order book - the complete distribution of orders, prices and  volumes on both sides of the exchange.
(a detailed description of the limit order mechanism is given in section 3.)
arriving limit orders that are entirely or partially executable with the best offers on the other side are executed immediately, with any  volume not immediately executable being placed in an queue (or book) ordered by price on the appropriate side (buy or sell).
in this mechanism, continuous trading takes place via the arrival of limit  orders specifying whether the party wishes to buy or sell, the volume desired, and the price offered.
the vast majority of equity trading is done via the  standard limit order market mechanism.
on the trading side, computer programs now are entrusted not only with the careful execution of large block trades for clients (sometimes referred to on wall street as program trading), but with the autonomous selection of stocks, direction (long or short) and volumes to trade for profit (commonly referred to as statistical arbitrage).
the so-called electronic communication networks (or ecns) that dominate trading in nasdaq stocks are a  common example of the automation of the exchanges.
this increase has taken place both in the exchanges, which are  increasingly computerized and offer sophisticated interfaces for  order placement and management, and in the trading  activity itself, which is ever more frequently undertaken by  software.
in recent years there has been an explosive increase in the automation of modern equity markets.
