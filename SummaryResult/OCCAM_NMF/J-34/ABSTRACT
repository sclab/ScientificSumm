our theoretical results are supported by large-scale experiments using limit order data from inet, a large electronic exchange for nasdaq stocks.
we prove that while the absolute trader model enjoys  provably strong stability properties, the relative trader model is vulnerable to great instability.
we show that the answer depends strongly on whether the market consists of absolute traders (who determine their prices independent of the current order book state) or relative traders (who determine their prices relative to the current bid and ask).
we ask whether such mechanisms are susceptible to butterfly effects - the infliction of large changes on common measures of market activity by only small perturbations of the order sequence.
we study the stability properties of the dynamics of the standard continuous limit-order mechanism that is used in modern equity markets.
