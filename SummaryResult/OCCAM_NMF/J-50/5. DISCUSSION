yet other selection criteria are the computational complexity of determining whether enough information has been elicited to declare a winner, and that of determining the optimal sequence of queries [8]. 
therefore, stv is more robust, although it may require slightly more worst-case  communication as per the table above.
stv is np-hard to manipulate in those settings as well [7], but also by an individual with perfect knowledge of the others" votes (when the number of  candidates is unbounded) [2].
plurality with runoff is np-hard to manipulate by a coalition of weighted voters, or by an individual that faces correlated uncertainty about the  others" votes [7, 6].
however, plurality has the undesirable property that it is computationally easy to manipulate by voting strategically [3, 7].
the table above shows that from a communication complexity perspective, plurality, plurality with runoff, and stv are preferable.
one way to select among these rules is to consider recent results on  complexity.
the voting rules that we studied in this paper are the most  common ones that have survived the test of time.
when deciding which voting rule to use for an election, there are many considerations to take into account.
it may be possible to outperform these bounds when the distribution of votes has additional structure.
also, all of our bounds are worst-case bounds.
this  restriction may invalidate some of the upper bounds that we derived using multistage communication protocols.
one area of future research is to study what happens when we restrict our attention to communication protocols that do not reveal any strategically useful information.
all of the lower bounds hold even for nondeterministic communication and even just for determining whether a given candidate a is the winner.
all of the upper bounds are deterministic (with the exception of maximin, for which the best deterministic upper bound we proved is o(nm log m)).

the following table summarizes the results we obtained.
knowing which voting rules require little  communication is especially important when the issue to be voted on is of low enough importance that the following is true: the parties involved are willing to accept a rule that tends 86 to produce outcomes that are slightly less representative of the voters" preferences, if this rule reduces the  communication burden on the voters significantly.
in this paper, we  analyzed the communication complexity of the common voting rules.
in the limit, this could lead to a shift from representational  government to a system in which most issues are decided by referenda-a veritable e-democracy.
by lowering this burden, it may become  feasible to conduct more elections over more issues.
one key obstacle to using voting for preference  aggregation is the communication burden that an election places on the voters.
