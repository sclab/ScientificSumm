difficult decisions; in particular, decision process of fb2 involves first choosing when to start ventilating site a, and then  (depending on the time it took to ventilate site a), choosing when to start evacuating the civilians from site b. such sequence of decisions constitutes the policy of an agent, and it must be found fast because time is running out. 
dotted  arrows represent implicit precedence constraints within an agent.
in general, agents have to perform a sequence of such 1 we explain the est and let notation in section 3 figure 1: civilian rescue domain and a mission plan.
if fb2 ventilates site a too early, the fire will spread out of control, whereas if fb2 waits with the  ventilation method for too long, fire at site b will become unbearable for the civilians.
we assign the reward 50 for evacuating the civilians from site b, and a smaller reward 20 for the successful ventilation of site a, since the civilians themselves might succeed in breaking out from site b. one can clearly see the dilemma, that fb2 faces: it can only  estimate the durations of the fight fire at site a methods to be  executed by fb1 and fb3, and at the same time fb2 knows that time is running out for civilians.
consequently, fb2 does not know if it is already safe to  ventilate site a, fb1 does not know if it is already safe to enter site a and start fighting fire at site b, etc.
the team estimates that the civilians have 20 minutes before the fire at site b becomes unbearable, and that the fire at site a has to be put out in order to open the access to site b. as has happened in the past in large scale disasters, communication often breaks down; and hence we assume in this domain that there is no  communication between the fire-brigades 1,2 and 3 (denoted as fb1, fb2 and fb3).
general fire fighting procedures involve both: (i) putting out the flames, and (ii) ventilating the site to let the toxic, high  temperature gases escape, with the restriction that ventilation should not be performed too fast in order to prevent the fire from spreading.
an office accessed from the floor)1 .
picture a small mission plan from figure (1), where three  firebrigades have been assigned a task to rescue the civilians trapped at site b, accessed from site a (e.g.
in particular, small teams of fire-brigades must be sent on separate missions to rescue the civilians trapped in dozens of different locations.
because there can be hundreds of  civilians scattered across numerous floors, multiple rescue teams have to be dispatched, and radio communication channels can quickly get saturated and useless.
one example domain is large-scale disaster, like a fire in a skyscraper.
we are interested in domains where multiple agents must  coordinate their plans over time, despite uncertainty in plan execution duration and outcome.
