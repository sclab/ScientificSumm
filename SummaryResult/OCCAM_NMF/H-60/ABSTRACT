categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information search and retrieval]: retrieval models general terms theory 
the framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models.
by assuming documents to be  independent rather than disjoint, we arrive at a poisson-based  probability of being informative.
we show that an intuitive idf -based probability function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events.
this paper reports on theoretical investigations about the assumptions underlying the inverse document frequency (idf ).
