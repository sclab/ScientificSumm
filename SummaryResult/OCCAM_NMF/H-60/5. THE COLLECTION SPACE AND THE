also, the results can be applied to containment of documents and  locations. 
however, the results regarding the term noise and informativeness apply to their dual counterparts: term occurrence and informativeness in a document.
those probabilities are defined in the  collection space.
we  concentrate in this paper on the probability of a term to be noisy and informative.
we have highlighted in this section the duality between the collection space and the document space.
tf(t, d):=lf(t, d):= pfreq (t occurs|d) pfreq (tmax occurs|d) = nl(t, d) nl(tmax , d) a further duality is between informativeness and  conciseness (shortness of documents or locations): informativeness is based on occurrence (noise), conciseness is based on  containment.
for the 231 space collection document dimensions documents and terms locations and terms document/location frequency nd(t, c): number of documents in which term t occurs in collection c nl(t, d): number of locations (positions) at which term t occurs in document d nd(c): number of documents in collection c nl(d): number of locations (positions) in  document d term frequency nt (d, c): number of terms that document d  contains in collection c nt (l, d): number of terms that location l contains in document d nt (c): number of terms in collection c nt (d): number of terms in document d noise/occurrence p(t|c) (term noise) p(t|d) (term occurrence) containment p(d|c) (document) p(l|d) (location) informativeness − ln p(t|c) − ln p(t|d) conciseness − ln p(d|c) − ln p(l|d) p(informative) ln(p(t|c))/ ln(p(tmin, c)) ln(p(t|d))/ ln(p(tmin, d)) p(concise) ln(p(d|c))/ ln(p(dmin|c)) ln(p(l|d))/ ln(p(lmin|d)) table 1: retrieval parameters actual term frequency value, it is common to use the  maximal occurrence (number of locations; let lf be the location frequency).
the definition makes explicit that the classical notion of term frequency of a term in a document (also referred to as the within-document term frequency) actually corresponds to the location frequency of a term in a document.
the document dimension in a collection space corresponds to the location (position) dimension in a document space.
we consider a document as a subset of t and a term as a subset of d. let nt (d) := |{t|d ∈ t}| be the number of terms that occur in the document d, and let nd(t) := |{d|t ∈ d}| be the number of documents that contain the term t. in a dual way, we associate a document space l × t with a document d where l is the set of locations (also referred to as positions, however, we use the letters l and l and not p and p for avoiding confusion with probabilities) and t is the set of terms in the document.
let nd := |d| and nt := |t| be the number of documents and terms, respectively.
document space consider the dual definitions of retrieval parameters in table 1. we associate a collection space d × t with a  collection c where d is the set of documents and t is the set of terms in the collection.
