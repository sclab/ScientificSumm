most importantly, the properties of stardust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight  environments. 
we predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the stardust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose  significant challenges.
stardust also shows robustness with respect to errors.
results show that  accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within  milliseconds.
stardust solves the localization problem for aerial  deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.
