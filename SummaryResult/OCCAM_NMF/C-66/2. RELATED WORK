the salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time (we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level), tasks within a job cannot  simultaneously run on different machines (we assume business  processes can be assigned to any available server), and the principal metric of performance is the makespan, which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete (and as we show later,  optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes, necessitating different metrics). 
our scenario is that business processes within a  workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers).
the classic job-shop scheduling problem, shown to be np-complete [4] [3], is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto  machinery (c.f.
our work also builds upon prior scheduling research.
[8] presents a feedback-based scheduling mechanism for multi-tiered systems with back-end databases, but unlike our work, it assumes a tighter coupling between the various components of the system.
however, the  provisioning techniques do not consider the challenges faced when there are alternative query execution plans and replicated data sources.
[10] presents a dynamic  provisioning approach that uses both predictive and reactive techniques for multi-tiered internet application delivery.
to one thousand as we show later) using different business  metrics and a search heuristic.
each business process accesses a service type and is then mapped to a service provider for that type.
advertised qos service agreement carrentalservice.com figure 1: an example scenario demonstrating the interaction between business processes in workflows and web service providers.
in the context of service assignment and scheduling, [11] maps web service calls to potential servers using linear programming, but their work is concerned with mapping only single workflows; our principal focus is on scalably scheduling multiple workflows (up 30 service type superhotels.com business process business process workflow ... business process business process ... hostilehostels.com incredibleinns.com business process business process business process ... business process service provider skyhighairlines.com supercrazyflights.com business process .
