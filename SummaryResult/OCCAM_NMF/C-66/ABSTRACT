we show that a genetic search algorithm is appropriate to perform this scheduling, and through experimentation we show that our algorithm scales well up to a thousand workflows and  produces better mappings than traditional approaches.
in this paper we provide heuristics for scheduling service requests from multiple business process workflows to web service providers such that a business value metric across all workflows is maximised.
because these business processes are web service consumers, service requests must be mapped and scheduled across multiple web  service providers, each with its own negotiated service level  agreement.
this issue is relevant to modern business scenarios where business processes within a workflow must complete within qos-defined limits.
although industry standards and recent research have sought to  define best practices and to improve end-to-end workflow  composition, one area that has not fully been explored is the scheduling of a workflow"s web service requests to actual service  provisioning in a multi-tiered, multi-organisation environment.
web services can be aggregated to create composite workflows that provide streamlined functionality for human users or other systems.
