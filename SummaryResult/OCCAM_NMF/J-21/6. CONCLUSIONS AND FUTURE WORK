a general study of this class of manipulations, together with a characterization of markets in which it can or cannot arise, would be very useful for the design of information markets. 
the example we studied in section 5 merely scratches the surface of this area.
finally, the existence of long-range manipulative strategies in  information markets is of great interest.
second, given the tight connection between the projection game and the spherical market scoring rule, it is natural to ask if we can find as strong a connection to other scoring rules or if not, to understand what strategic differences are implied by the form of the scoring rule used in the market.
it would be very useful to have an automatic transformation of a given projection game into another game in which the payoffs can be implemented in expectation without knowing the probability, and preserves the strategic properties of the projection game.
firstly, the payoffs of the projection game cannot be directly implemented in situations in which the true probability is not ultimately revealed.
our results raise several very interesting open questions.
we demonstrate that the projection game can be used to analyze traders" strategies in this scenario, and potentially to help design markets with better strategic properties.
in section 5, however, we analyze a small example market without this assumption.
the general analysis was based on the assumption that traders do not actively try to mislead other traders for future profit.
we have used this model to analyze the cost, profit, and strategies of a trader in a dynamic parimutuel market, and shown that both the  dynamic parimutuel market and the spherical market scoring rule are strategically equivalent to the restricted projection game under slight distortion of the prior probabilities.
we have presented a simple geometric game, the  projection game, that can serve as a model for strategic behavior in information markets, as well as a tool to guide the  design of new information markets.
