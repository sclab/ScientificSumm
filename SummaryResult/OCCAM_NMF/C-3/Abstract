we evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the grid.
this approach  allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded wan links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant performance improvements.
then, we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs.
during the application run, we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and  deduce application requirements from these statistics.
we start an application on any set of resources.
in this paper, we investigate an approach that does not require performance models.
however,  constructing such models is a complex task.
existing solutions to these two problems require that a  performance model for an application is known.
another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid  environment.
one important problem in grid computing is resource selection, that is, finding an appropriate resource set for the application.
grids are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic.
