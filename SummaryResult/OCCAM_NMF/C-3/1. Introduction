finally, in section 7, we conclude and  describe future work. 
in section 6, we compare our approach with the related work.
in section 5, we evaluate our approach in a number of grid scenarios.
in section 4, we describe its implementation in the satin framework.
in section 3, we present our resource selection and adaptation strategy.
in section 2, we explain what assumptions we are making about the applications and grid resources.
the rest of this paper is structured as follows.
we evaluate the performance of our approach on the das-2 wide-area system and we will show that our approach yields major performance improvements (roughly 10-60 %) in the above scenarios.
we implemented our strategy in satin, which is a java-centric framework for writing grid-enabled divide-and-conquer  applications (20).
we believe that our approach can be extended to other classes of applications with the given assumptions.
divide-and-conquer has been shown to be an attractive paradigm for programming grid applications (4; 20).
we have applied our ideas to divide-and-conquer applications, which satisfy these requirements.
it should not use static load balancing or be very sensitive to  wide121 area latencies.
it handles all of the following cases: • automatically adapting the number of processors to the degree of parallelism in the application, even when this degree changes dynamically during the computation • migrating (part of) a computation away from overloaded  resources • removing resources with poor communication links that slow down the computation • adding new resources to replace resources that have crashed our work assumes the application is malleable and can run  (efficiently) on multiple sites of a grid (i.e., using co-allocation (15)).
a major advantage of our approach is that it improves  application performance in many different situations that are typical for grid computing.
processors are added or deleted to stay between the thresholds, thus adapting automatically to the  changing environment.
(10) to determine the efficiency and tries to keep the efficiency of the application between a lower and upper threshold derived from their theory.
our adaptation strategy uses the work by eager et al.
next, we adjust the resource set the application is running on by adding or removing compute nodes or even entire clusters.
we use these statistics to automatically estimate the resource requirements of the application.
during the application run, we periodically collect  information about the communication times and idle times of the  processors.
we start an application on any set of resources.
in this paper, we introduce and evaluate an alternative approach to application adaptation and resource selection which does not need a performance model.
typically, an analytical performance model is used, but constructing such a model is inherently difficult and requires an expertise which application programmers may not have.
predicting the application runtime on a given set of resources, however, requires knowledge about the application.
for resource selection, the application runtime is estimated for some resource sets and the set that yields the shortest runtime is selected for execution.
this approach has been adopted by a number of systems (5; 14; 18).
the adaptation problem can be reduced to the resource selection problem: the resource selection phase can be repeated during  application execution, either at regular intervals, or when a performance problem is detected, or when new resources become available.
to maintain a reasonable performance level, the application therefore needs to adapt to the changing conditions.
also, new, better resources may become available.
another important problem is that the performance and availability of grid resources varies over time: the network links or compute nodes may become overloaded, or the compute nodes may become unavailable because of crashes or because they have been claimed by a higher priority application.
in a grid environment this problem is even more difficult, because of the heterogeneity of resources: the compute nodes have various speeds and the quality of network connections between them varies from low-latency and high-bandwidth local-area networks (lans) to high-latency and possibly low-bandwidth wide-area networks (wans).
even in traditional,  homogeneous parallel environments, finding the optimal number of nodes is a hard problem and is often solved in a trial-and-error fashion.
one important problem is resource selection - selecting a set of compute nodes such that the  application achieves good performance.
however, the complexity of grid environments also is many times larger than that of traditional parallel machines like clusters and supercomputers.
a grid provides much computational power, and thus offers the possibility to solve very large problems, especially if applications can run on multiple sites at the same time (7; 15; 20).
in recent years, grid computing has become a real alternative to  traditional parallel computing.
