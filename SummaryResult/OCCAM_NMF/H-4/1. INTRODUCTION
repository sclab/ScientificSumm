thus, this paper offers two  contributions to the field: an increased understanding of pim behaviour at the task level and an evaluation method that will facilitate further investigations. 
in the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using different methods of task creation.
we also look at the features of the tasks that make re-finding difficult.
the study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and  produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.
in the first part of this paper we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.
in this paper, we attempt to address the difficulties  involved to faciliate controlled laboratory pim evaluations.
capra [6] also identifies the need for controlled pim lab evaluations to complement other  evaluation techniques, placing specific emphasis on the need to understand pim behaviour at the task level.
for example, kelly [16] proposes that numerous methodologies must be taken to examine and understand the many issues involved in pim, although, she makes explicit reference to the need for  laboratory based pim studies and a common set of shared tasks to make this possible.
recently, however, researchers have started to focus on ways to  address the problem of pim evaluation.
a particular feature of pim research is that many  systems have been designed to assist users with managing and re-finding their information, but very few have been  evaluated; a situation noted by several scholars [1, 6, 7].
therefore, experimenters face a number of challenges in order to conduct realistic but controlled pim evaluations.
the precise nature of this information - what  information individuals would prefer to keep private - varies across individuals making it difficult to base search tasks on the contents of individual collections.
secondly, personal collections may contain information that the participants are uncomfortable sharing within an  evaluation.
as personal collections are unique, we cannot create evaluation tasks that are applicable to all participants in an evaluation.
this means that the collections people generate are unique to them alone and the information within a collection is  intrinsically linked with the owner"s personal experiences.
people collect  information as a natural consequence of completing other tasks.
one of the main difficulties is caused by the personal nature of pim.
however the evaluation of these pim systems is problematic.
pim systems - the methods and procedures by which people handle, categorize, and  retrieve information on a day-to-day basis [18] - are  becoming increasingly popular.
personal information management (pim) is a rapidly  growing area of research concerned with how people store,  manage and re-find information.
