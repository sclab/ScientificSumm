in the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using two different methods of task creation.
the study examines the kind of tasks that require users to re-find information and produces a taxonomy of re-finding tasks for email messages and web pages.
in the first part, we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks.
in this paper we aim to facilitate pim evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties.
the difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal  information.
this has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing pim evaluations.
a feature of pim research is that many systems have been designed to assist users  manage and re-find information, but very few have been  evaluated.
personal information management (pim) is a rapidly  growing area of research concerned with how people store,  manage and re-find information.
