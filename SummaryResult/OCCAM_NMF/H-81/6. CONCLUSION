in consequence, the distance measures identified as the best will be implemented in the open mpeg-7 based visual information retrieval framework vizir [4].
this work offers suitable distance measures for various situations.
the choice of the right distance function for similarity measurement depends on the descriptor, the queried media collection and the semantic level of the user's idea of similarity.
from [15]).
since these two measures perform significantly better than the mpeg-7 recommendations they should be further tested on large collections of image and video content (e.g.
in the evaluation the best overall distance measures for visual content - as extracted by the visual mpeg-7 descriptors - turned out to be the pattern difference measure and the meehl index (for homogeneous descriptions).
to be able to use predicate-based distance measures next to quantitative measures a quantisation model was defined that allows the application of predicate-based measures on continuous data.
eight descriptors were selected, 38 distance measures were implemented, media collections were created and assessed, performance indicators were defined and more than 22500 tests were performed.
the evaluation presented in this paper aims at testing the recommended distance measures and finding better ones for the basic visual mpeg-7 descriptors.
