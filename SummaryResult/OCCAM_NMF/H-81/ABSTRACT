the evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in the mpeg-7-standard are among the best but that other measures perform even better.
additionally, a quantisation model was developed to be able to use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well.
three media collections were created and assessed, performance indicators developed and more than 22500 tests performed.
eight visual mpeg-7 descriptors were selected and 38 distance measures implemented.
the evaluation presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures suggested by the mpeg-7 group for the visual descriptors can be beaten by general-purpose measures.
in visual information retrieval the careful choice of suitable proximity measures is a crucial success factor.
