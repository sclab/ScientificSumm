in the following section, we will discuss our experience in designing and implementing jms for mobile ad-hoc  networks. 
persistence is, however, essential  functionality in asynchronous communication environments as hosts are, by definition, connected at different times.
this assumes a very centralised architecture, which again does not match the  requirements of a mobile ad-hoc setting, in which nodes may be moving and sparse: a more distributed and dynamic  solution is needed.
secondly, a jms provider, as suggested by the jms  specification, also needs to be reachable by each node in the network, in order to communicate.
in mobile ad-hoc environments, the discovery process cannot assume the existence of a fixed set of discovery servers that are always reachable, as this would not match the dynamicity of ad-hoc networks.
however, due to the way jndi is designed, a jndi node (or more than one) needs to be in reach in order to  obtain a binding of a name to an address (i.e., knowing where a specific queue/topic is).
clients can then learn about them using the java naming and directory interface (jndi).
as discussed in section 2, a jms administrator defines queues and topics on the provider.
firstly, discovery needs to use a resilient but distributed model: in this  extremely dynamic environment, static solutions are  unacceptable.
if jms is to be adapted to completely ad-hoc  environments, where no fixed infrastructure is available, and where nodes change location and status very dynamically, more issues must be taken into consideration.
however, this approach is somewhat limited in terms of widespread applicability and scalability as a consequence of the concentration of  functionality in the wired portion of the network.
the client prototype presented in [10] is very lightweight, due to the delegation of all the heavyweight functionality to the middleware for pervasive and ad-hoc computing 122 provider on the wired network.
in [10], jms was adapted to a nomadic mobile setting, where mobile hosts can be jms clients and communicate through the jms provider that, however, sits on a  backbone network, providing reliability and persistence.
the challenges of porting jms to mobile settings are considerable; however, in view of its widespread  acceptance and use, there are considerable advantages in allowing the adaptation of existing applications to mobile  environments and in allowing the interoperation of applications in the wired and wireless regions of a network.
whilst the jms specification has been extensively  implemented and used in traditional distributed systems,  adaptations for mobile environments have been proposed only recently.
in between these two types of "mobile" networks, there are, however, a number of possible heterogeneous combinations, where nomadic and ad-hoc paradigms are used to interconnect totally unwired areas to more structured networks (such as a lan or the internet).
mobile ad-hoc  networks are most generally applicable in situations where  survivability and instant deployability are key: most notably in military applications and disaster relief.
mobile networks vary very widely in their characteristics, from nomadic networks in which modes relocate whilst  offline through to ad-hoc networks in which modes move freely and in which there is no infrastructure.
