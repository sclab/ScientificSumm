we discuss in detail the design challenges and some possible  solutions, showing a concrete example of the feasibility and suitability of the application of the asynchronous paradigm in this setting and outlining a research roadmap for the  coming years.
in this paper, we present our experience in designing, implementing and evaluating emma (epidemic messaging middleware for ad-hoc networks), an adaptation of java message service (jms) for mobile ad-hoc environments.
message oriented middleware for traditional systems has been developed and used to provide an asynchronous paradigm of communication for distributed systems, and, recently, also for some specific mobile computing systems.
instead, asynchronous communication seems to be a generally more suitable paradigm for such  environments.
in  particular, the synchronous communication paradigms often  employed in standard middleware do not appear to be  particularly suited to ad-hoc environments, in which not even the intermittent availability of a backbone network can be assumed.
the characteristics of mobile environments, with the  possibility of frequent disconnections and fluctuating bandwidth, have forced a rethink of traditional middleware.
