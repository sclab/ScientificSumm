we also would like to acknowledge the support of the australian research council under grant dp0663147. 
acknowledgments we are very thankful to michael winikoff for many  stimulating and helpful discussions of this material.
also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such tll specifications in our framework.
our further work will include using tll to verify  various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.
moreover, we  emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of tll inference rules to provide the  advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.
our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional tll.
similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of  linear logic and tll respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing  capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.
not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.
this requires another execution in the  commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.
moreover, external  mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle  operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type  representations.
in particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on  commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.
also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created  accordingly.
these approaches use logic systems that are limited in their  expressiveness to model resources.
approaches based on commitment  machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.
many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents"  interactive actions.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select  appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.

in particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via  commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.
agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.
in particular, tll is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight  integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.
this paper uses tll for specifying interaction protocols.
