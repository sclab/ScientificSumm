the banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 
different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].
the banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 the banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 s⊂n|i∈s [v(s) − v(s \ {i})].
however, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.
this index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.
different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and  different definitions of having a significant role, have caused  researchers to define different power indices, one of the most  prominent of which is the banzhaf index [1].
2.1 the banzhaf index a common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.
one approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the banzhaf index.
an agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition c if the agent"s removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(c) = 1, v(c \ {i}) = 0. a swing is a pair < i, s > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition s. a question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.
we say a coalition c ⊂ i wins if v(c) = 1, and say it loses if v(c) = 0. we denote the set of all winning coalitions as w(v) = {c ⊂ 2i |v(c) = 1}.
a coalitional game is composed of a set of n agents, i, and a function mapping any subset (coalition) of the agents to a real value v : 2i → r. in a simple coalitional game, v only gets values of 0 or 1 (v : 2i → {0, 1}).
