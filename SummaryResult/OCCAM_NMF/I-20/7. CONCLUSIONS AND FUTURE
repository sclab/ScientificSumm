finally, we believe that there are many additional interesting domains other than weighted voting games and network flow games, and it would be worthwhile to investigate the complexity of calculating the banzhaf index or other power indices in such domains. 
we have only considered the complexity of calculating the banzhaf index; it  remains an open problem to find the complexity of calculating the shapley-shubik or other indices in the network flow domain.
it might also be possible to find other useful restricted domains where it is possible to exactly calculate the banzhaf index.
it remains an open problem to find ways to tractably  approximate the banzhaf index in the general network flow domain.
in the case of connectivity games (where it is only required for a coalition to contain a path from the source to the destination) played on bounded layer graphs, it is possible to calculate the banzhaf index of an agent in polynomial time.
despite this discouraging result for the general network flow domain, we have also provided a more encouraging result for a restricted domain.
although the banzhaf index theoretically allows us to measure the power of the agents in the network flow game, we have shown that the problem of calculating the banzhaf index in this domain in #p-complete.
this power index may be used to decide how to allocate maintenance resources in real-world networks, in order to maximize our ability to maintain a certain flow of information between two sites.
we have assessed the relative power of each agent in this scenario using the banzhaf index.
directions we have considered network flow games, where a coalition of agents wins if it manages to send a flow of more than some value k between two vertices.
