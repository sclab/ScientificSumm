in section 6 we discuss related work, and we conclude in section 7. 
in section 5 we consider a restricted case of the network flow game, and present results.
in section 4 we discuss the banzhaf power index in network flow games, presenting our complexity result in the general case.
in section 2 we give some  background concerning coalitional games and the banzhaf power  index, and in section 3 we introduce our specific network flow game.
the paper proceeds as follows.
there are implications in this scenario to real-world networks; for example, the power index might be used to allocate maintenance resources (a more powerful edge being more critical), in order to maintain a given flow of data between two points.

we also show that for some restricted network flow domains (specifically, of  con1 we use the term in its intuitive sense here, but in the social choice literature, preference aggregation and voting are basically  synonymous.
we show that calculating the banzhaf power index of each agent in this general network flow domain is #p-complete.
in this game, a coalition of agents wins if it can send a flow of size k from a source vertex s to a target vertex t, with the relative power of each edge reflecting its significance in allowing such a flow.
we look at some computational aspects of the banzhaf power index in a specific environment, namely a network flow game.
the banzhaf power index is one of the most popular measures of voting power, and although it has been used primarily for measuring power in weighted voting games, it is well-defined for any simple coalitional game.
a power index is a measure of the power that a subgroup, or equivalently a voter in a weighted voting environment, has over decisions of a larger group.
in this paper, we consider a topic that has been less studied in the context of automated agent voting, namely power indices.
one of the most massive preference aggregation schemes in existence is google"s pagerank algorithm, which can be viewed as a vote among  indexed web pages on candidates determined by a user-input search string; winners are ranked (tennenholtz and altman [21] consider the axiomatic foundations of ranking systems such as this).
in fact, to see the generality of the (automated) voting scenario, consider modern web searching.
candidates in virtual elections have also been beliefs, joint plans [5], and schedules [7].
[6] built a movie  recommendation system; a user"s preferences were represented as agents, and movies to be suggested were selected through agent voting.
ghosh et al.
the practical applications of voting among automated agents are already widespread.
does  complexity of computation prevent realistic implementation of a  technique?
can  complexity be used to guard against unwanted phenomena?
what is the complexity of the process?
what distinguishes computer science work in these areas is its  concern for computational issues: how are results arrived at (e.g.,  equilibrium points)?
interest in the theory of economics and social choice has in fact become widespread throughout computer science, because it is  recognized as having direct implications on the building of systems comprised of multiple automated agents [16, 4, 22, 17, 14, 8, 15].
there is a rich literature on the subject of voting1 from political science, mathematics, and economics, with important theoretical results, and builders of  automated agents can benefit from this work as they engineer systems that reach group consensus.
social choice theory can serve as an appropriate foundation upon which to build multiagent applications.
