we also show that for some restricted network flow domains there exists a polynomial algorithm to calculate agents" banzhaf power indices.
we show that calculating the banzhaf power index of each agent in this network flow domain is #p-complete.
the relative power of each edge/agent reflects its significance in enabling such a flow, and in real-world networks could be used, for example, to allocate resources for maintaining parts of the network.
agents control the edges of a graph; a coalition wins if it can send a flow of a given size from a source  vertex to a target vertex.
in this paper, we examine the computational complexity of  calculating the banzhaf power index within a particular multiagent  domain, a network flow game.
the banzhaf power index is one of the most popular; it is also well-defined for any simple coalitional game.
however, power indices (which reflect how much real power a voter has in a weighted voting system) have received relatively little attention, although they have long been studied in political science and economics.
preference aggregation is used in a variety of multiagent  applications, and as a result, voting theory has become an important topic in multiagent system research.
