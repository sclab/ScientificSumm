when a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the  appropriate index is the banzhaf index.3 we can use the banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ i (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 
more precisely, a connectivity game is a network flow game where each of the edges has identical capacity, c(e) = 1, and the target flow value is k = 1. in such a scenario, the goal of a coalition is to have at least one path from s to t: v(c) = 1 if ec contains a path from s to t; 0 otherwise; given a network flow game (or a connectivity game), we can compute the power indices of the game.
given a coalition c, which controls the edges ec = {ei|i ∈ c}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. we define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(c) = 1 if ec allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; a simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.
the game consists of a network flow graph g =< v, e >, with capacities on the edges c : e → r, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set i of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei.
3.2 formal definition formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.
in other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target.
under a reasonable probabilistic model, the banzhaf index  provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources.
to ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited  maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on  allowing this flow.
a coalition of agents wins the game if it manages to send a flow of at least k from source s to target t, and loses otherwise.
the game consists of agents in a network flow graph, with a certain source vertex s and target vertex t. each agent controls one of the graph"s edges, and a coalition of agents controls all the edges its members control.
we model this problem by considering a network flow game.
this is called the normalized banzhaf index.
2 banzhaf actually considered the percentage of such coalitions out of all winning coalitions.
given limited resources to maintain network links, which edges should get those resources?
3.1 motivation consider a communication network, where it is crucial to be able to send a certain amount of information between two sites.
