they have shown that certain families of network flow games and similar games have nonempty cores. 
however, they  introduced a non-simple game, where the value a coalition of agents achieves is the maximal total flow.
[10, 9] have considered a similar network flow domain, where each agent controls an edge of a network flow graph.
the network flow game we have defined is a simple game.
in this paper, we have considered the network flow domain, where a coalition of agents must achieve a flow beyond a certain value.
since the number of possible coalitions is exponential in the number of agents,  calculating power indices in time polynomial in the number of agents can only be achieved in specific domains.
the problem of computing power indices in simple games  depends on the chosen representation of the game.
matsui and matsui [13] have shown that calculating both the banzhaf and shapley-shubik indices in weighted voting games is np-complete.
since the shapley value of any simple game has the same value as its shapley-shubik index, this shows that  calculating the shapley-shubik index in weighted majority games is  #pcomplete.
deng and papadimitriou [2] show that computing the shapley value in weighted majority games is #p-complete, using a reduction from knapsack.
[12] contains a survey of algorithms for calculating power indices of weighted majority games.
the naive implementation of an algorithm for calculating the banzhaf index of an agent i enumerates all coalitions containing i. there are 2n−1 such coalitions, so the performance is  exponential in the number of agents.
[11] considers these two indices along with several others, and describes the axioms that characterize the different indices.
both the shapley-shubik and the banzhaf indices have been widely studied, and straffin [20] has shown that each index reflects specific conditions in a voting body.
the banzhaf index was mathematically analyzed in [3], where it was shown that this normalization lacks certain desirable  properties, and the more natural banzhaf index is introduced.
this index is similar to the banzhaf index discussed in section 1, and is defined as: βi = βi(v) k∈n βk .
the normalized banzhaf index measures the proportion of coalitions in which a player is a swinger, out of all winning coalitions.
the banzhaf index emerged directly from the study of voting in decision-making bodies.
the shapley-shubik index [19] is the direct application of the shapley value to simple coalitional games.
in his seminal paper, shapley [18] considered coalitional games and the fair allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition (the coalition of all agents) to its members.
the most popular indices  suggested for such measurement are the banzhaf index [1] and the shapley-shubik index [19].
measuring the power of individual players in coalitional games has been studied for many years.
