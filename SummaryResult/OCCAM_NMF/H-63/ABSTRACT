we prove our argument with the help of simulation results.
we argue that this scheme, when applied to ldd, significantly improves performance in terms of tuning time over the above mentioned schemes.
in this paper, we discuss the broadcast of ldd in our project data in your space (days), and propose a scheme for indexing ldd.
none of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data (ldd) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination.
two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes.
access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme.
push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast.
push based broadcast [1] is essentially asymmetric, i.e., the volume of data being higher from the server to the users than from the users back to the server.
many dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push data to wireless channels for general consumption.
data dissemination through wireless channels for broadcasting information to consumers is becoming quite common.
