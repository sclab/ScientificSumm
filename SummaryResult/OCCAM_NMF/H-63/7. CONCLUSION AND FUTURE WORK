we will show that the ldd scheme together with the data staging architecture significantly improves the latency for global as well as local query. 
we intend to use our ldd scheme and data staging architecture in the pull based architecture.
it is transferred from the user"s source server to the destination server through the use of leo satellites.
the query in this case is a global query.
this may be done by putting a request to the source server.
data from the server is available for access by the global users.
22 in the future work we try to incorporate pull based architecture in our days project.
we showed in our simulations that the lbis scheme has the lowest tuning time for broadcasts having large number of pages, thus saving valuable battery power in the mu.
the lbis has been compared with two other prominent indexing schemes, i.e., the distributed tree indexing scheme and the exponential indexing scheme.
the mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our days project to create the push based architecture.
we have used the containment property of ldd in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.
we have presented a scheme called lbis to index this ldd.
we have presented an example to show how the hierarchical structure of the location tree maps with the data to create ldd.
in this paper we have presented a scheme for mapping of wireless broadcast data with their locations.
