simulation of our scheme and its performance evaluation is presented in section 6. section 7 concludes the paper and mentions future related work. 
location dependent data, its generation and subsequent broadcast is presented in section 4. section 5 discusses our indexing scheme in detail.
section 3 describes our days architecture.
in section 2, we discuss previous work related to indexing of broadcast data.
the rest of the paper is presented as follows.
we show with simulation results that our scheme outperforms some of the earlier indexing schemes for broadcasting ldd in terms of tuning time.
we propose an indexing scheme in days which takes care of some these problems.
in addition to providing low latency, they lack properties which are used to address ldd issues.
none of the above indexing schemes is equally effective in broadcasting location dependent data.
also, the average length of broadcast increases due to the index replication and this may cause significant increase in the access latency.
for broadcasts with large number of pages, the exponential scheme has been shown to perform similarly as the tree based schemes in terms of access latency.
the exponential schemes facilitate index replication by sharing links in different search trees.
this significantly affects the tuning time of the mobile unit.
to start a search, the mu has to wait until it reaches the root of the next broadcast tree.
the main disadvantages of the tree based schemes are that they are based on centralized tree structures.
several indexing schemes have been proposed in the past and the prominent among them are the tree based and the exponential indexing schemes [17].

access latency may be defined as the time elapsed since a request has been issued till the response has been received.
it can also be defined as the number of buckets tuned by the mobile device in active state to get its required data.
tuning time refers to the time during which the mobile unit (mu) remains in active state to tune the channel and download its required data.
two parameters that affect these are the tuning time and the access latency.
energy conservation [7, 10] refers to the efficient use of the limited energy of the mobile device in accessing broadcast data.
access efficiency refers to the latency experienced when a request is initiated till the response is received.
access efficiency and energy conservation are the two issues which are significant for data broadcast systems.
it also allows the user to personalize his own mobile device by selectively tuning to the information of his choice.
a mobile user, thus, has some free time to go into the doze mode which conserves valuable power.
the indexing approach stores control information which tells the user about the data location in the broadcast and how and when he could access it.
a simple broadcast, however, is likely to cause significant performance degradation in the energy constrained mobile devices and a common solution to this problem is the use of efficient air indexing.
in our project called days, we use wireless data broadcast mechanism to push ldd to users and mobile users monitor and tune the channel to find and download the required data.
but there are every indications that with time some of the complex technical problems such as uniform location framework, calculating and tracking locations in all types of places, positioning in various environments, innovative location applications, etc., will be resolved and lbs will become a common facility and will help to improve market productivity and customer comfort.
we see a limited deployment of lbs by some service providers.
the lbs application would interact with other location technology components or use the mobile user's input to determine the user's location and download the information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating ldd.
an example would be someone using their mobile device to search for a vegetarian restaurant.
one of the best ways to accomplish this is through the dissemination of highly personalized location based services (lbs) which allows users to access personalized location dependent data.
the effectiveness of a data dissemination system is judged by its ability to provide user the required data at anywhere and at anytime.
the mode of data transfer is essentially asymmetric, that is, the capacity of the transfer of data (downstream communication) from the server to the client (mobile user) is significantly larger than the client or mobile user to the server (upstream communication).
wireless data dissemination is an economical and efficient way to make desired data available to a large number of mobile or static users.
