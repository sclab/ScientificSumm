query request in the surrogates may subsequently be used to generate the popularity patterns which ultimately decide the broadcast schedule [12].
we believe that data staging can be used to drastically reduce the latency time for both the local broadcast data as well as global responses.
data staging in surrogates has been earlier investigated as a successful technique [12, 15] to cache users' related data.
the local broadcast space consists of a broadcast tower, mobile units and a network of data staging machines called the surrogates.
data is pushed into the local broadcast space so that users may tune into the wireless channels to access the data.
the days architecture [12] as shown in figure 1 consists of a data server, broadcast scheduler, days coordinator, network of leo satellites for global data delivery and a local broadcast space.
the other is a comparatively lightly loaded queue consisting of locally uploaded queries.
one is a heavily loaded queue containing globally uploaded queries.
technically, we see the presence of two types of queues in the pull based data access.
the other case deals with the server sending results of user queries through downlink wireless channels.
thus, we envision the presence of two types of data distribution: in the first case, server pushes data to local users through wireless channels.
non topical data such as hotel, restaurant, real estate prices, etc., do not change so often.
topical data, for example, weather information, traffic information, stock information, etc., constantly changes over time.
days has been conceptualized to disseminate topical and  nontopical data to users in a local broadcast space and to accept queries from individual users globally.
