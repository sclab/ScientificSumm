3. we incorporate robustness into the organizational structures. 
2. we model the use of resources other than only processor  resources.
this in turn  allows us to reason about (1) alternative task and role  assignments that make different quality/cost tradeoffs and generate different organizational structures and (2) uncertainties in the execution of tasks.
the main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. we extend existing osd approaches to use tæms as the  underlying problem representation, which allows us to model and use osd for worth-oriented domains.
[5, 6, 3, 15].
tæms has been used to model many different  problemsolving environments including distributed sensor networks,  information gathering, hospital scheduling, ems, and military planning.
each node in tæms is labeled with a characteristic  accumulation function that describes how many or which subgoals or sets of subgoals need to be achieved in order to achieve a particular  higherlevel goal.
tæms also allows  various mechanisms for specifying subtask variations and alternatives, i.e.
the executable methods, themselves, may have  multiple outcomes, with different probabilities and different  characteristics such as quality, cost and duration.
the leaf nodes are at the lowest level of abstraction and represent executable methods - the primitive actions that the agents can perform.
the sub-nodes of a node represent the subtasks and methods that make up the  highlevel task.
the root node of the task structure represents the high-level goal that the agent is trying to achieve.
tæms [11] (task analysis, environment modeling and simulation) is a computational framework for  representing and reasoning about complex task environments in which tasks (problems) are represented using extended hierarchical task structures [3].
we use tæms as the underlying representation for our  problem solving requests.
in our approach (as in [10]), we define two operators for osd - agent spawning and composition - when an agent becomes overloaded, it spawns off a new agent to handle part of its task load/responsibility; when an agent lies idle for an extended period of time, it may decide to compose with another agent.
we believe that osd is especially suited to the above scenario in which the environment is semi-dynamic as the agents can adapt to changes in the task structures and environmental  conditions, while still being able to generate relatively stable  organizational structures that exploit the common characteristics across problem instances.
organizational self-design (osd) [4, 10] has been proposed as an approach to designing organizations at run-time in which the agents are responsible for generating their own organizational structures.
on the other hand, all problem instances and environmental conditions are not always unique, which would render inefficient the use of a new, bespoke organizational structure for every problem instance.
the environmental conditions may not be known a priori, or may change over time, which would  preclude the use of a static organizational structure.
instead, the optimal organizational structure depends both on the problem at hand and the environmental conditions under which the problem needs to be solved.
the organizational design is complicated by the fact that there is no best way to  organize and all ways of organizing are not equally effective [2].
in this paper, we are primarily interested in the organizational design of a multiagent system - the roles enacted by the agents, ∗primary author is a student the coordination between the roles and the number and assignment of roles and resources to the individual agents.
