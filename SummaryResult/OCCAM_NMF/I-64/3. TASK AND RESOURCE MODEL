4. all resources are non-consumable. 
furthermore, we assume that each agent has to own the set of resources that it  needseven though the resource ownership can change during the evolution of the organization.
3. all resources are exclusive, i.e., only one agent may use a resource at any given time.
because it represents many contingencies, alternatives, uncertain characteristics and  runtime flexible choices, the same underlying task structure can play out very differently across specific instances.
we believe that this assumption holds for many of the practical problems that we have in mind because tæms task structures are  basically high-level plans for achieving some goal in which the steps required for achieving the goal-as well as the possible contingency situations-have been pre-computed offline and represented in the task structure.
∃t∀iti = t, where t is the task structure of the problem that the mas is trying to solve.
2. all problem solving requests have the same underlying task structure, i.e.
that is, we do not assume a fixed set of agents - instead agents are created (spawned) and destroyed (combined) as needed.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) 1229 • c is a mapping from a resource to the cost of that resource, that is c(resource) : r → n+ we also make the following set of assumptions in our research: 1. the agents in the mas are drawn from the infinite set a = {a1, a2, a3, ...}.
joint conf.
2 p is the power set of set, i.e., the set of all subsets of a set the sixth intl.
that is ρ(method, resource) : m × r → n. 1 n is the set of natural numbers including zero and n+ is the set of positive natural numbers excluding zero.
• ρ is a mapping from an executable method and resource to the quantity of that resource needed (by an agent) to  schedule/execute that method.
• r is the set of resources.
again, see [5] for formal definitions.
• e is the set of (non-local) effects.
see [5] for formal definitions.
for our research, we use four cafs: min, max, sum and  exactly one.
the cafs determine how a task group accrues  quality given the quality accrued by its subtasks/methods.
• q is the set of quality/characteristic accumulation functions (cafs).
each discrete  distribution is itself a set of pairs, {(n1, p1), (n2, p2), ..., (nn, pn)}, where pi ∈ + is the probability that the outcome will have a quality/cost/duration of nl ∈ n depending on the type of distribution and pm i=1 pl = 1.
furthermore, each outcome, ol is represented using the triple (ql, cl, dl), where ql is the quality distribution, cl is the cost distribution and dl is the duration distribution of outcome ol.
in the pair (ol, pl), ol is an outcome and pl is the probability that executing mk will result in the outcome ol.
• m is the set executable methods, i.e., m = {m1, m2, ..., mn}, where each method, mk, is represented using the outcome distribution, {(o1, p1), (o2, p2), ..., (om, pm)}.
the quality accrued on a problem is equal to the quality of task τ.
the highest level goal that the organization is trying to achieve.
• τ ∈ t, is the root of the task structure, i.e.
for our convenience, we  define two functions subtasks(task) : t → p(t ∪ m) and supertasks(tæms node) : t ∪ m → p(t), that return the subtasks and supertasks of a tæms node respectively2 .
formally, each task tj can be represented using the pair (qj, sj), where qj ∈ q and sj ⊂ (t ∪ m).
tasks have a characteristic  accumulation function (see below) and are themselves composed of other subtasks and/or methods that need to be achieved in order to achieve the goal represented by that task.
the tasks are non-leaf nodes in a tæms task structure and are used to denote goals that the agents must achieve.
furthermore, every underlying task structure, ti, can be  represented using the tuple < t, τ, m, q, e, r, ρ, c >, where: • t is the set of tasks.
in order for the mas to accrue quality, the task ti must be completed before the deadline, di.
the mas has no prior knowledge about the task ti before the arrival time, ai.
in this scheme, ti is the underlying tæms task structure, ai ∈ n+ is the arrival time and di ∈ n+ is the deadline of the ith task instance1 .
in our model, the primary input to the multi-agent system (mas) is an ordered set of problem  solving requests or task instances, < p1, p2, p3, ..., pn >, where each problem solving request, pi, can be represented using the tuple < ti, ai, di >.
to ground our discussion of osd, we now formally describe our task and resource model.
