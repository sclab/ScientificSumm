we then evaluate our approach against the contract-net approach and show that our osd agents perform better, are more efficient, and more flexible to changes in the environment.
we extend the existing osd approach to include  worthoriented domains, model other resources in addition to only  processor resources and build in robustness into the organization.
organizational-self design (osd) has been proposed as an  approach for constructing suitable organizational structures at  runtime.
on the other hand, for many real environments, the problems are not totally unique either:  certain characteristics and conditions change slowly, if at all, and these can have an important effect in creating stable organizational  structures.
this precludes the use of static, design-time generated,  organizational structures in such systems.
if the environment is dynamic, the  environmental conditions or the problem task structure may change over time.
attempting to  optimize an organizational structure depends strongly on  environmental features including problem characteristics, available resources, and agent capabilities.
however, there is no best way to organize and all ways of organizing are not equally effective.
organizations are an important basis for coordination in  multiagent systems.
