then, the system output is the organization obtained from the interaction between agents, while taking into account feedback coming from the  ontologist when he/she modifies the taxonomy given his needs or  expertise. 
it means that each agent represent a class in the taxonomy.
the dynamo multi-agent system implements the distributed  clustering algorithm described in detail in section 3 and the rules  described in section 4. it is designed to be both the system  producing the resulting structure and the structure itself.
with syntex, those contexts are identified by terms and characterized by some syntactic relations.
in the case of terms we are generally dealing with their usage contexts.
because of the nature of the data, we are only focusing on similarity computation between objects described thanks to  binary variables, that means that each item is described by the  presence or absence of a characteristic set [15].
for each term pair, we assume that it is possible to compute a similarity value in order to make a  clustering [6] [1].
with dynamo, the term network obtained as the output of the  extractor is stored in a database.
moreover, "knowledge engineering" is composed of "knowledge" as head term and "engineering" as expansion term.
for example, "knowledge engineering from text" has "knowledge engineering" as head term and "text" as  expansion term.
the maximum sub-phrase located as head of the term its expansion term2 , and also to all the terms for which it is a head or an expansion term.
in such a network, each term is linked to its head term1 and 1 i.e.
in particular, it creates a "head-expansion" network which has already proven to be interesting for a clustering system [1].
we mainly  selected it because of its robustness and the great amount of  information extracted.

figure 1): • a term network, obtained thanks to a term extraction tool used to preprocess the textual corpus, • a multi-agent system which uses the term network to make a hierarchical clustering in order to obtain a taxonomy of  concepts, • an interface allowing the ontologist to visualize and control the clustering process.
the dynamo system consists of three parts (cf.
it addresses the needs of knowledge engineering in the context of dynamic  ontology management and maintenance when the ontology is linked to a document collection.
2.2 proposed architecture in this section, we present our system architecture.
it justifies how we designed some of the rules used by our agents in order to maximize the  cooperation degree within dynamo"s multi-agent system.
we followed the adelfe method [4] proposed to drive the design of this kind of multi-agent system.
to support the needed flexibility of such a system we use a  selforganizing multi-agent system based on a cooperative approach [9].
in this way, a dynamic ontology is a self-organizing process occurring when new texts are included into the corpus, or when the ontologist interacts with it.
the ontology modification is a perturbation of the previous equilibrium by the appearance or disappearance of agents or relationships.
thus, our approach considers an ontology as a type of equilibrium between its concept-agents where their forces are  defined by their potential relationships.
an ontology can be seen as a stable map constituted of  conceptual entities, represented here by agents, linked by labelled  relations.
as output, dynamo provides to the analyst a hierarchical  organization of concepts (the multi-agent system itself) that can be  validated, refined of modified, until he/she obtains a satisfying state of 1286 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas the semantic network.
it uses several criteria based on statistics computed from the linguistic contexts of terms to create and position the concepts.
dynamo takes a syntactical and terminological analysis of texts as input.
this choice comes from the  qualities offered by multi-agent system: they can ease the interactive design of a system [8] (in our case, a conceptual network), they allow its incremental building by progressively taking into account new data (coming from text analysis and user interaction), and last but not least they can be easily distributed across a computer  network.
the chosen approach is completely original to our knowledge and uses an adaptive multi-agent system.
2.1 ontology as a multi-agent system dynamo aims at reducing the need for manual actions in  processing the text analysis results and at suggesting a concept  network kick-off in order to build ontologies more efficiently.
