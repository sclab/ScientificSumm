and finally, in section 5, we discuss the limitations of our approach and explain how it will be addressed in further work. 
then, in section 3 we discuss the  distributed clustering algorithm used in dynamo and compare it to a more classic centralized approach.
in particular the motives that led to its creation and its general architecture.
section 4 is dedicated to some enhancement of the agents behavior that got designed by taking into account criteria ignored by clustering.
this paper first presents, in section 2, the big picture of the  dynamo system.
in our work, we propose an interaction between the ontologist and the system, our external resource lies both in the texts and the ontologist.
researchers, working on the construction of ontologies from texts, claim that the work to be automated requires external resources such as a dictionary [14], or web access [5].
this process consists in using an existing ontology and building a new one from it.
this approach is different from our  approach because dynamo starts from scratch.
most works  interested in the construction of ontologies [7] propose the refinement of ontologies.
they"re sometimes used to ease the  ontology building process, in particular for collaborative contexts [3], but they rarely represent the ontology itself [16].
in the multi-agent field, ontologies generally enable agents to  understand each other [12].
an ontologist is a kind of cognitive engineer, or analyst, who is using information from texts and expert interviews to design ontologies.
we propose a semi-automated tool since an external resource is required: the "ontologist".
our aim is not to build an exhaustive, general hierarchical ontology but a domain specific one.
our research focuses on dynamo (an acronym of dynamic  ontologies), a tool based on an adaptive multi-agent system to  construct and maintain an ontology from a domain specific set of texts.
it would mean creating dynamic ontologies [10] and it justifies the emergence of ontology learning techniques [14] [13].
currently, a real challenge lies in building them automatically or semi-automatically and keeping them up to date.
but building an ontology manually is a slow, tedious, costly, complex and time consuming process.
nowadays, it is well established that ontologies are needed for semantic web, knowledge management, b2b... for knowledge management, ontologies are used to annotate documents and to  enhance the information retrieval.
