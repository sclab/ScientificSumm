categories and subject descriptors i.2.11 [artificial intelligence]: distributed artificial  intelligencemultiagent systems general terms algorithms, experimentation 
with those results in mind, we discuss the limits of our system and add as perspectives the  modifications required to reach a complete ontology building solution.
we also present how it has been improved using a multi-criteria approach.
it is evaluated and compared to a more conventional centralized algorithm.
in this paper we present a distributed hierarchical clustering algorithm, core of our approach.
our system named  dynamo is designed along this domain but following an original  approach based on an adaptive multi-agent architecture.
ontologies building from text is still a time-consuming task which justifies the growth of ontology learning.
