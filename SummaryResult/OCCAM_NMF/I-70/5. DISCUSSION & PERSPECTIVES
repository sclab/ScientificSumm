most of the work needed to develop those rules consists in finding the relevant statistic information that will support the ontologist. 
as we pointed, it is not enough, so new rules are needed to allow removing nodes from the tree, or move them toward the root.
currently, our system has the necessary rules to create  intermediate levels in the taxonomy, or to have concepts shifting towards the leaf.
in this case  "conceptagent:10" and "conceptagent:11" could probably be merged.
moreover the branch starting with "conceptagent:8" clearly respects the constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the user in a more compact and meaningful form.
in particular, since "l√©sion" moved,  "conceptagent:9" could be removed, it is not needed anymore.
by looking at figure 7, it is clear that some pruning could be done in the taxonomy.
although the head coverage rule is an improvement because it is based on how the ontologists generally work, it only addresses low level structuring but not the intermediate levels of the tree.
but we have to keep in mind that we are trying to obtain taxonomies which are more refined and concise.
since this work was first based on this algorithm, it introduced a clear bias toward binary trees as a result.
5.2 pruning for ontologies building in section 3, we presented the distributed clustering algorithm used in the dynamo system.
in particular since they will take into account criteria ignored by the centralized algorithm.
we are currently working on the required rules, but the comparison with centralized algorithm will become very difficult.
we need to improve our distributed algorithm to allow a concept to move along a branch.
"hepatitis" is located in the right branch, but we have not obtained the same organization as the figure 6 of the previous  example.
the system reacts and stabilizes, we then obtain figure 12 as a  result.
figure 12: concept agent tree after taking in account  "hepatitis" then, the ontologist interacts with the system and adds a new concept described by the term "hepatitis" and linked to the root.
by using test data and letting the system work by itself, we obtain the hierarchy of figure 11 after stabilization.
figure 11: concept agent tree after autonomous stabilization of the system to illustrate our claims, we present another example of the  working system.
on the contrary, adding a new item after a first stabilization has an impact on the final result.
when the  system works by itself on a fixed data set given during initialization, the final result is equivalent to what we could obtain with a  centralized algorithm.
5.1 current limitation of our approach the most important limitation of our current algorithm is that the result depends on the order the data gets added.
