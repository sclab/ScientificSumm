we"re planning to work on such benchmarking in the near future. 
of course, our system still requires more evaluation and validation work to accurately determine the  advantages and flaws of this approach.
and, more generally it"s likely to be interesting for other design related tasks, even if we"re focusing only on knowledge  engineering in this paper.
this  dynamic ontologies can be seen as complex problem solving, in such a case self-organization through cooperation has been an efficient solution.
also from the multi-agent engineering point of view, their use in a dynamic ontology context has shown its relevance.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) 1291 termediate levels, and we need to be able to remove them if  necessary, in order to reach a dynamic equilibrium.
joint conf.
in other words this algorithm introduces  inthe sixth intl.
we"re currently working on the criterion to trigger the complementary actions of the structure changes applied by our clustering algorithm.
from this  improvements we are mostly focusing on the pruning to obtain better taxonomies.
it must continue, both to ensure a better robustness during classification, and to obtain richer structures semantic wise than simple trees.
from the point of view of ontology building, this work is a first step showing the relevance of our approach.
its strengths are mostly qualitative since it allows more subtle user interactions and a progressive adaptation to new linguistic based information.
performances of the system are interesting and some aspects are even comparable to their centralized counterpart.
the current state of our software allows to produce simple structures, to propose them to the ontologist and to make them evolve depending on the  modifications he made.
our system makes use of a terminological network  resulting from an analysis made by syntex.
we proposed an approach based on an adaptive multi-agent  system to provide the ontologist with a first taxonomic structure of concepts.
our contribution lies in this step of the modeling process from texts, before any attempts to normalize or formalize the result.
that said, those tools produce a huge amount of lexical or grammatical data which is not trivial to  examine in order to define conceptual elements.
using  natural languages processing tools ease the knowledge localization in texts through language uses.
it requires analyst supervising and taking in account the ontology aim.
after being presented as a promising solution, ensuring model quality and their terminological richness, ontology building from textual corpus analysis is difficult and costly.
