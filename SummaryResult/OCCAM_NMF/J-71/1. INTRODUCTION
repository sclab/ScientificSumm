traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 
while there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard cda mechanism.
dpm prices do reflect current  information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.
the price function  determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. the complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in cdas and cdawmms.
prices are computed  automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.
if a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.
the market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.
a dpm is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a cda.
a dpm has the infinite  liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price  automatically set by the market institution.
the subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or  transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.
a  constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the  market.
a dpm is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so  exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).
a dpm can be thought of as a  hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a cda.
in this paper, i develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic  parimutuel market (dpm).
because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.
pari-mutuel market participants  cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.
for this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the market"s close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.
however, pari-mutuel  mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.
pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.
pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity:  anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a  market maker.
as a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.
both the cda and cdawmm offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information  becomes available.
a cdawmm and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.
a successful cda must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are  attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.
but a cda can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.
a cda only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the  market institution.
some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a  revolution in the wagering business.1 each mechanism has pros and cons for the market  institution and the participating traders.
these trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.
recently, there has been a move to employ cdas or cdawmms for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing,  political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.
though there is no formal or  logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.
horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.
the primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.
the dominant mechanism used in  financial circles is the continuous double auction (cda), or in some cases the cda with market maker (cdawmm).
a wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.
