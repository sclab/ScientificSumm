also note that-in either dpm formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 
if a occurs, the trader breaks even; if b occurs, the trader loses $3.
the trader"s loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.
the trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1a.
the buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1a (the buyer"s price refunded).
the trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.
now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.
the trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.
so the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.
the trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5  investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of a. the 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.
now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.
the share is  composed of $5·1a and $p1 ·1a.
consider a share of a purchased for $5.
7.3 pseudo aftermarket for dpm i there is an alternative pseudo aftermarket that"s  possible for the case of dpm i that does not require bundling.
the seller in the first aftermarket receives p1mpr(a) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1mpr(b) dollars.
if there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyer"s share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1a from the first  aftermarket, and p1 ·1a from the second aftermarket.
the buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1a + p1 · 1a dollars.
a buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.
suppose the current price for 1 share of a is p1.
the bundling mechanism works as follows.
in this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the dpm market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.
however, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central dpm.
one can  imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.
in this case shares are not homogenous: each share of a is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1a dollars, and (2) the payoff of p1 · 1a dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1a is the indicator function equalling 1 if a occurs, and 0 otherwise.
in fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.
however, an aftermarket is still possible.
7.2 aftermarket for dpm i when winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.
in this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer.
new buyers will accept the  lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.
every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can  simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.
in fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.
7.1 aftermarket for dpm ii for the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.
buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker.
or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.
so traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.
this is  accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.
a key advantage of dpm over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.
