our experiments on the newly annotated tdt4 benchmark corpus show encouraging utility enhancement over indri, and also over our own system with incremental learning and novelty detection turned off. 
we also proposed an extension of the ndcg metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a weighted combination of relevance and novelty.
we developed a new scheme for automated evaluation and feedback based on a semi-automatic  procedure for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.
our system, called cafÂ´e, combines adaptive filtering, novelty detection and  antiredundant passage ranking in a unified framework for utility optimization.
this paper presents the first investigation on utility-based information distillation with a system that learns the  longlasting information needs from fine-grained user feedback over a sequence of ranked passages.
