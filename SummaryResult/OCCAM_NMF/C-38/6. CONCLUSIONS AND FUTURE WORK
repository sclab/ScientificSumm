we are also prototyping this framework to conduct real-world experiments on the planet-lab in a near future. 
we are currently evaluating various aspects of this framework via simulation, and exploring the design space of key  components.
this is a starting point for our work on pro.
we described the basic framework and its key components, and sketched our  strawman solutions.
furthermore, pro uses congestion controlled bandwidth as an implicit signal to detect shared bottleneck among existing parents as well as changes in network or overlay conditions to properly reshape the structure.
both peer discovery and peer selection in this framework are scalable.
therefore, pro should be able to maximize delivered quality to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth connectivity.
pro allows each peer to selfishly and independently determine the best way to connect to the overlay to  maximize its performance.
in this paper, we presented a simple receiver-driven  framework for architecting peer-to-pee overlay structures called pro.
