related work in taking advantage of this property include [7], where the authors attempted to address this problem by user modeling techniques. 
this is because the users" traffic and query patterns can reduce the state space and speed up the learning process.
the learning based approach is perceived to be more beneficial for real distributed information retrieval systems which  exhibit locality property.
in p2p based content sharing systems, this property is exemplified by the phenomenon that users tend to send queries that represent only a limited number of  topics and conversely, users in the same neighborhood are likely to share common interests and send similar queries [10].
it has been discovered that the locality property is an  important feature of information retrieval systems in user  modeling studies[3].

a variant of q-learning techniques is deployed the sixth intl.
each agent maintains estimations, probabilistically or  deterministically, on the distance to a certain destination through its neighbors.
in this domain, the destination of a packet is deterministic and unique.
while this line of studies carry a certain similarity with our work, it has mainly focused on packet-switched communication networks.
there are two major classes of adaptive, distributed packet  routing algorithms in the literature: distance-vector algorithms and link-state algorithms.
these studies have explored fully distributed algorithms that are able, without central  coordination to disseminate knowledge about the network, to find the shortest paths robustly and efficiently in the face of changing network topologies and changing link costs.
ip-level routing problems have been attacked from the reinforcement learning  perspective[2, 5, 11, 12].
in addition, the destination agents in our  contentrouting algorithms are multiple and the addresses are not known in the routing process.
the content routing problem differs from the  networklevel routing in packet-switched communication networks in that content-based routing occurs in application-level  networks.
