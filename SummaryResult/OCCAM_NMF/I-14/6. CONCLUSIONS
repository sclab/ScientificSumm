the experiments on two different distributed ir datasets illustrates that the reinforcement learning approach improves considerably the cumulative utility over time. 
thereafter, these agents route the queries based on the learned policies and update the  estimates on the expected utility based on the new routing policies.
based on the updated expected utility information, the agents  modify their routing policies.
these  estimates are updated gradually by learning from the feedback information returned from previous search sessions.
particularly, agents maintain estimates, namely expected utility, on the downstream agents" ability to provide relevant documents for incoming queries.
in this paper, a reinforcement-learning based approach is developed to improve the performance of distributed ir search algorithms.
