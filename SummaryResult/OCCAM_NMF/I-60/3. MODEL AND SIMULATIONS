for example, if an average journey length of a certain agent in iteration 1 with no  selfinterested agent was 50, and the length was 60 in the same scenario and iteration in which self-interested agents were involved, then the normalized value for that agent would be 60/50 = 1.2. more details regarding the simulations are described in sections 4 and 5. 
using the normalized values enabled us to see how worse (or better) each agent would perform compared to the basic setting.
this was done for all of the iterations.
the normalized values were calculated by  comparing each agent"s result to his results when the same  scenario was run with no self-interested agents.
in order to gain a similar ordinal scale, the results were normalized.
to gain statistical significance we ran each simulation with changes in the set of the gossip agents, and the set of the self-interested agents.
the simulations were done with different percentages of self-interested agents.
thus, in our simulation, we focus only on simulations in which the percentage of gossip agents is 20%.
yet, due to congestion caused by too many cars rushing to what is reported as the less congested part of the network 20-30% of gossiping agents leads to the most efficient routing results in their experiments.
[13, 14] that the  information propagation in the network is very efficient when the percentage of gossiping agents is 10% or more.
it has been shown by parshani et al.
for each such scenario 5 simulations are run, creating a total of 25 simulations for each experiment.
each such traffic scenario differs from one another by the initial load of the roads and the designated routes of the agents (cars) in the network.
each of the experiments that we describe below is run with 5 different traffic scenarios.
this allows us to simulate somewhat a daily routine in the transportation network (e.g., a working week).
in each iteration the same agents are used with the same origin and destination points, whereas the data collected in earlier iterations is preserved in the future iterations (referred to as the history of the agent).
the average number of cars passing through the network during the iteration is about 70,000 and the  average number of cars in the network at a specific time unit is about 3,500 cars.
each iteration simulates six hours of movements.
the basic time unit of the iteration is a step, which  equivalents to about 30 seconds.
each simulation consists of 6 iterations.
3.2 simulation design building on [13], the network in our simulations replicates a central part of a large city, and consists of 50 junctions and 150 roads, which are approximately the number of main streets in the city.
a detailed description of their behavior is given in sections 4 and 5.
we will refer to these agents as self-interested agents.
a subset of the gossip agents are those agents who are  selfinterested and manipulate the devices for their own benefit.
we  assume that each agent stores the most recent information it has received or gathered around the edges in the network.
since the communication range is limited, the  exchange of information using gossiping is done in one of two ways: (a) between gossip agents passing one another, or (b) between gossip agents located at the same junction.
those agents are referred to as gossip agents.
however, we assume that some agents have means of inter-vehicle  communication (e.g., ieee 802.11) with a given communication range, which enables them to communicate with other agents with the same device.
regular agents are only capable of gathering information about the roads as they traverse them.
initially, agents are ignorant about the state of the roads.
every agent has to travel between its origin and destination points and aims to minimize its journey length.
a journey length is defined as the sum of all weights of the edges constituting this path.
we assume that there is always a path between a source and a destination.
a journey is defined as the (not  necessarily simple) path taken by an agent between the origin vertex and the destination vertex.
each car, which is associated with an autonomous agent, is given a pair of origin and destination points (vertices).
the roads" weights vary in time according to the  network (traffic) load.
an edge e âˆˆ e is associated with a weight w > 0, which specifies the time it takes to traverse the road associated with that edge.
3.1 formal model following shavitt and shay [15] and parshani [13], the transportation network is represented by a directed graph g(v, e), where v is the set of vertices representing  junctions, and e is the set of edges, representing roads.
we first describe the formal transportation network model, and then we describe the simulations designs.
