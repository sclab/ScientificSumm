for example, whereas the average journey length of the regular agents increased only by about 15% in the original scenario, in which the  network was not congested, in this scenario the average journey length of the agents had increased by about 60%. 
the simulation results, detailed in table 5, show that there is a greater incentive for the self-interested agents to cheat when the network is already congested, as their cheating causes more damage to the other agents in the network.
the behavior of the self-interested agents is as described in section 4.1, and the self-interested agents spread lies about their own route.
to this end, we simulated a network in which 13 main roads are jammed.
we also examined the impact of sending lies in order to cause chaos when there are already congestions in the  network.
thus, it took the data longer to reach agents on the main roads, and when the agents reached the relevant roads this data was too old to be incorporated in the other agents calculations.
the main reason was that the lies were spread on roads that were not on the route of the self-interested agents.
when analyzing the results we saw that although the false data was spread, it did not cause other gossip cars to change their route.
the average normalized value for the gossip agents in these simulations was only about 1.07, as opposed to 1.7 in the original scenario.

however, the results show quite a smaller impact on other gossip and  reguthe sixth intl.
in this set of experiments, all the self-interested agents spread lies about the same 13 main roads in the network.
to examine this hypothesis, we designed another set of experiments.
furthermore, we hypothesize that if they all send lies about the same major roads the damage they might inflict on the entire network would be larger that had each of them sent lies about its own route.
since the goal of the self-interested agents in this case is to cause disorder in the network rather than use the lies for their own benefits, the question arises as to why would the behavior of the self-interested agents be to send lies about their routes only.

in contrast, these results also indicate that the self-interested agents do not succeed in causing a significant load in the network by their malicious behavior.
the results also indicate that the regular gossip agents are more sensitive to malicious behavior than regular  agentsthe average journey length for the gossip agents increases significantly (e.g., with 32 self-interested agents the average journey length for the gossip agents was 146% higher than in the setting with no self-interested agents at all, as  opposed to an increase of only 25% for the regular agents).
however, when only one self-interested agent is involved, it does  benefit from the malicious behavior, even in the first iteration.
similar to the results in our first set of experiments, described in section 4.2, we can see that randomly selected self-interested agents who follow different randomly selected routes do not benefit from their malicious behavior (that is, their average journey length does not decrease).
figure 2 demonstrates the changes in the normalized values for the regular gossip agents and the regular agents, as a function of the iteration number.
table 3 summarizes the data for the first iteration and table 4 summarizes the data for the average of all iterations.
tables 3 and 4 summarize the normalized journey length for the self-interested agents, the regular gossip agents and the regular (non-gossip) agents.
for example: the run with 50  selfinterested agents consisted of all the self-interested agents that were used in the run with 32 self-interested agents, but with an additional 18 self-interested agents.
each self-interested agent behaved in the same manner as described in section 4.1. every simulation consisted of 11 runs with each run  comprising different numbers of self-interested agents: 0 (no  selfinterested agents), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 50, 64, 80 and 100. also, in each run the number of self-interested agents was increased incrementally.
in each simulation different agents were  randomly chosen (using a uniform distribution) to act as  gossip agents, among them self-interested agents were chosen.
to understand the vulnerability of the gossip based  transportation support system, we ran 5 different simulations for each scenario.
this can be achieved, for example, by maximizing the average journey length of all agents, even at the cost of maximizing their own journey length.
another possible behavior that can be adopted by  selfinterested agents is characterized by their goal to cause  disorder in the network.
