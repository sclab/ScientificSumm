categories and subject descriptors i.2.11 [artificial intelligence]: distributed artificial  intelligence-intelligent agents general terms experimentation 
using a simulation environment, which  models a real transportation network in a large city, we  demonstrate the benefits achieved by self-interested agents if no counter-measures are implemented.
these car owners will try to manipulate their agents such that they transmit false data to their peers.
nonetheless, this new technology and agent  applications may lead to the emergence of self-interested car owners, who will care more about their own welfare than the social welfare of their peers.
though, currently these systems are a proprietary, we envision a  natural evolution where agent applications will be developed for vehicular systems, e.g., to improve car routing in dense urban areas.
indeed, car manufacturers are already equipping their cars with such devices.
as more and more cars are equipped with gps and wi-fi transmitters, it becomes easier to design systems that will allow cars to interact autonomously with each other, e.g., regarding traffic on the roads.
