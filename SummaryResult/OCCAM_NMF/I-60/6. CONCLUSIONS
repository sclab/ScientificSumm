another research direction would be to find ways of minimizing the effect of selfish-agents by using  distributed reputation or other measures. 
motivated by the simulation results, future research in this field will focus on modeling different behaviors of the self-interested agents, which might cause more damage to the network.
also, by the time their lies reach other agents, they might become irrelevant, as more recent data has reached the same agents.
while the self-interested agents spread lies, they cannot choose which agents with whom they will  interact.
some reasons for this are the special characteristics of vehicular networks and their dynamic nature.
this is in  contrast to the greater impact inflicted by self-interested agents in other domains (e.g., e-commerce).
our simulations indicate that in both behaviors the  selfinterested agents have only limited success achieving their goal, even if no counter-measures are taken.
using  simulations we investigated two behaviors that might be taken by self-interested agents: (a) trying to minimize their  journey length, and (b) trying to cause chaos in the network.
in this paper we investigated the benefits achieved by self-interested agents in vehicular networks.
