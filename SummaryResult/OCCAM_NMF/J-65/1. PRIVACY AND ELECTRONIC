in section 5 we summarize and discuss our conclusions. 
in section 4 we show how  behavioral models based on immediate gratification bias can better explain the attitudes-behavior dichotomy and match available data.
in section 3 we show the difficulties that hinder any model of privacy decision  making based on full rationality.
in the next section we propose a model of rational agents facing privacy sensitive decisions.
however, more fundamental human behavioral responses must also be addressed if privacy ought to be  protected.
improved  technologies, by lowering costs of adoption and protection, certainly can help.
our conclusion is that simply providing more  information and awareness in a self-regulative environment is not sufficient to protect individual privacy.
• we show, following similar studies in the economics of immediate gratification [31], that even ‘sophisticated" individuals may under certain conditions become  ‘privacy myopic."
• we show that the magnitude of the perceived costs of privacy under certain conditions will not act as  deterrent against behavior the individual admits is risky.
• in particular, we show that individuals may have a  tendency to under-protect themselves against the privacy risks they perceive, and over-provide personal  information even when wary of (perceived) risks involved.
in their experiment, self-proclaimed privacy advocates were found to be willing to reveal varying amounts of personal information in exchange for small rewards.
for example, they can  explain the results presented by [36] at the acm ec "01 conference.
• we show that alternative models of personal behavior and time-inconsistent preferences are compatible with the dichotomy between attitudes and behavior and can better match current data.
in this  paper we draw from these developments to reach the following conclusions: • we show that it is unlikely that individuals can act rationally in the economic sense when facing privacy sensitive decisions.
that clash with the fully rational view of the economic agent.
however, developments in the area of behavioral economics have highlighted various forms of psychological inconsistencies (self-control problems,  hyperbolic discounting, present-biases, etc.)
this approach can be compared to those who see in the decision 21 not to protect one"s privacy a rational choice given the  (supposedly) low risks at stake.
for example, [5] study rational models of addiction.
traditional economics postulates that people are forward-looking and bayesian updaters: they take into account how current  behavior will influence their future well-being and preferences.
we apply lessons from behavioral economics.
we will comment on that in section 5, where we will also discuss strategies to empirically validate our theory.
we do not address the issue of whether people should actually protect  themselves.
we focus on  individual (mis)conceptions about their handling of risks they face when revealing private information.
in this paper we focus on the first question: we formally analyze the individual decision making process with respect to privacy and its possible shortcomings.
still missing are: an explanation grounded in  economic or psychological theories; an empirical validation of the proposed explanation; and, of course, the answer to the most recurring question: should people bother at all about privacy?
preliminary  interpretations of this phenomenon have been provided [2, 38, 33, 40].
the dichotomy between privacy attitudes and behavior has been highlighted in the literature.
the failure of several on-line services aimed at providing anonymity for internet users [6] offers additional indirect evidence of the reluctance by most individuals to spend any effort in protecting their personal information.
[36, 10, 18, 21] have found evidence that even privacy  concerned individuals are willing to trade-off privacy for  convenience, or bargain the release of very personal information in exchange for relatively small rewards.
surveys in this field, however, as well as experiments and anecdotal evidence, have also painted a different picture.
although the media hype has somewhat diminished, risks and costs have  notas evidenced by the increasing volumes of electronic spam and identity theft [16].
according to a jupiter research study in 2002, $24.5 billion in on-line sales will be lost by 2006 - up from $5.5 billion in 2001.  online retail sales would be approximately twenty-four percent higher in 2006 if consumers" fears about privacy and  security were addressed effectively [21].
more  recently, a february 2002 harris interactive survey found that the three biggest consumer concerns in the area of on-line personal information security were: companies trading  personal data without permission, the consequences of insecure transactions, and theft of personal data [19].
a federal trade commission study reported in 2000 that sixty-seven  percent of consumers were very concerned about the privacy of the personal information provided on-line [11].
a pricewaterhousecoopers study in 2000 showed that nearly two thirds of the consumers surveyed would shop more online if they knew retail sites would not do  anything with their personal information [15].
commerce privacy remains an important issue for electronic  commerce.
