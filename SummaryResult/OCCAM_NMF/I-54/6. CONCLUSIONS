in future, it will be interesting to treat the number of issues as uncertain. 
apart from this, we treated the number of issues as being common knowledge to the agents.
it will be interesting to analyze the case where ka c and kb c have other, possibly different, probability  distributions.
first, for online negotiation, we assumed that the constants ka c and kb c are both uniformly distributed.
there are several interesting directions for future work.
these approximate strategies also have polynomial time complexity.
specifically, we showed that an approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and analysed the approximation error.
finally, we extended the analysis to online negotiation where the issues  become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about the features of these issues.
we also analysed the difference between the true optimum and the approximate optimum.
these strategies have polynomial time complexity.
we then presented approximately optimal negotiation  strategies and showed that they form an equilibrium.
specifically, we first showed that finding the equilibrium offers is an np-hard problem even in a complete information  setting.
thus, the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate the issues between themselves so as to maximize their individual utilities.
the issues are indivisible and different agents value different issues  differently.
this paper has studied bilateral multi-issue negotiation between self-interested autonomous agents with time constraints.
