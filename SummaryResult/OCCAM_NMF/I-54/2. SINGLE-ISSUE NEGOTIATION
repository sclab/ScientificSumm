we then present a time efficient approximate equilibrium. 
on the basis of the above equilibrium for single-issue  negotiation with complete information, we first obtain the equilibrium for multiple issues and then show that computing these offers is a hard problem.
since we have two agents and either of them could move first, we get two possible equilibrium outcomes.
note that the equilibrium outcome depends on who makes the first move.
thus, depending on whether n is odd or even, a makes the following offer at t = 1: a(1) = j offer [1, 0] if odd n accept if b"s turn b(1) = j offer [0, 1] if even n accept if a"s turn agent b accepts this offer and negotiation ends in the first time period.
since a makes an offer at t = 1 and the agents use the alternating offers protocol, the offering agent for the last time period is b if n is even and it is a if n is odd.
this, in turn, depends on whether n is odd or even.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) offer for t = 1 depends on who the offering agent is for the last time period.
joint conf.
thus, we assume that b accepts a"s offer.
952 the sixth intl.
however,  irrespective of whether b accepts or rejects the proposal, it gets zero utility (because the deadline is n = 1).
2 it is possible that b may reject such a proposal.
hence we have a single discount factor for both agents.
agent a"s 1 having a different discount factor for different agents only makes the presentation more involved without leading to any changes in the analysis of the strategic behaviour of the agents or the time  complexity of finding the equilibrium offers.
as before, agent a decides what to offer in the first round by  looking ahead as far as t = n and then reasoning backwards.
in general, if the deadline is n, negotiation proceeds as follows.
agent b accepts this and an agreement occurs in the first time period.
hence, during the first time period, agent a offers [0, 1].
agent a reasons that if negotiation proceeds to the second round, b will take 100 percent of the pie by offering [0, 1] and leave nothing for a. thus, in the first time period, if a offers b anything less than the whole pie, b will reject the offer.
now, consider the case where the deadline is n = 2. in order to decide what to offer in the first round, a looks ahead to t = 2 and reasons backwards.
since the deadline is n = 1, b accepts this offer and agreement takes place in the first time period.
here, a is in a powerful position and is able to propose to keep 100 percent of the pie and give nothing to b 2 .
to begin, consider the case where the deadline for both agents is n = 1. if b accepts, the division occurs as agreed; if not, neither agent gets anything (since n = 1 is the deadline).
let agent a denote the first mover (i.e., at t = 1, a proposes to b who should get the pie).
for the above setting, the agents reason as follows in order to determine what to offer at t = 1. we let a(1) (b(1)) denote a"s (b"s) equilibrium offer for the first time period.
then, for a given pie, the set of possible offers is: {[xt i, yt i ] : xt i = 0 or 1, yt i = 0 or 1, and xt i + yt i = 1} at time t, if a and b receive a share of xt i and yt i respectively, then their utilities are: ua i (xt i, t) = j xt i × δt−1 if t ≤ n 0 otherwise ub i (yt i , t) = j yt i × δt−1 if t ≤ n 0 otherwise the conflict utility (i.e., the utility received in the event that no deal is struck) is zero for both agents.
let [xt i, yt i ] denote the offer made at time period t where xt i and yt i denote the share for agent a and b respectively.
this decrease is represented with a discount factor denoted 0 < δi ≤ 1 for both1 agents.
specifically, the decrease occurs at each step of offer and counteroffer.
an essential feature of negotiations involving alternating offers is that the agents" utilities decrease with time [21].
thus, there are three possible actions an agent can take during any time period: accept the last offer, make a new counter-offer, or quit the negotiation.
this process of making offers continues until one of the agents either accepts an offer or quits negotiation (resulting in a conflict).
otherwise, negotiation proceeds to the next time period, in which agent b makes a counter-offer.
if it accepts, negotiation ends in an agreement with a getting xi and b getting yi = 1 − xi.
one of the agents, say a, starts negotiation in the first time period (i.e., t = 1) by making an offer (xi = 0 or 1) to b. agent b can either accept or reject the offer.
the agents use an alternating offers protocol (as the one of rubinstein [18]), which proceeds through a series of time periods.
let n ∈ n+ denote this deadline.
there is a deadline (i.e., a number of rounds by which negotiation must end).
this issue is a ‘pie" of size 1 and the agents want to determine who gets the pie.
the two agents negotiate over a single indivisible issue (i).
there are two strategic agents: a and b. each agent has time constraints in the form of deadlines and discount factors.
before doing so, we give an overview of this model and its equilibrium strategies.
hence we use this basic single issue model and extend it to multiple issues.
since our focus is on indivisible issues (i.e., parties are allowed to make one of two possible offers: zero or one), our scenario fits in well with [27].
we adopt the single issue model of [27] because this is a model where, during negotiation, the parties are allowed to make offers from a set of discrete offers.
