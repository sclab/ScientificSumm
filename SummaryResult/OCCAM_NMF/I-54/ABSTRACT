these approximate strategies also have polynomial time complexity.
specifically, we show that an approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and show that the expected difference between the optimum and the approximate is o( âˆš m) .
finally, we extend the analysis to online  negotiation where different issues become available at different time points and the agents are uncertain about their valuations for these issues.
the time complexity of the approximate equilibrium strategies is o(nm/ 2 ) where n is the negotiation deadline and the relative error.
we also analyze the relative error (i.e., the difference between the true optimum and the approximate).
in order to  overcome this computational complexity, we then present negotiation strategies that are approximately optimal but computationally  efficient, and show that they form an equilibrium.
then, we analyse their time  complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an np-hard problem, even in a complete information setting.
for such negotiations, we first obtain the  equilibrium strategies for the case where the issues for negotiation are known a priori to the parties.
thus, the problem is for the agents to decide how to allocate the issues between themselves so as to maximize their  individual utilities.
here different agents value different issues differently.
the issues are indivisible (i.e., individual issues cannot be split between the parties; each issue must be allocated in its  entirety to either agent).
there are m > 1 issues for negotiation where each issue is viewed as a pie of size one.
the agents have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors.
this paper analyzes bilateral multi-issue negotiation between  selfinterested autonomous agents.
