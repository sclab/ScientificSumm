finally, online and approximate mechanisms have been studied in the context of auctions [14, 9] but not for bilateral negotiations (which is the focus of our work). 
in contrast, our focuses on negotiation regarding who will carry out which task.
on the other hand [22] focus on the use of contracts for task allocation to multiple self interested agents but this work concerns finding ways of decommitting contracts (after the initial allocation has been done) so as to improve an agent"s utility.
in contrast, our focus is on two agents where both of them are self-interested and want to maximize their individual  utilities.
for example [25] analyze the problem for the case where the agents act so as to maximize the benefit of the system as a whole.
the problem of task allocation has been  previously studied in the context of coalitions involving more than two agents.
existing work for the case of indivisible issues has mostly dealt with task allocation problems (for tasks that cannot be partioned) to a group of agents.
specifically, no previous work has determined an approximate equilibrium for multi-issue negotiation or for online negotiation.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) 957 where each issue is divisible.
joint conf.
however, all the above mentioned work differs from ours in that we focus on indivisible issues while others focus on the case the sixth intl.
in contrast to the above work that mainly deals with sequential negotiation, [6] studies the equilibrium for the package deal  procedure.
a number of researchers have also studied negotiations with an endogenous agenda [2].
for instance, fershtman [7] analyze  sequential negotiation with exogenous agenda.
now, the agenda can be decided before negotiating the issues (such an agenda is called exogenous) or it may be decided during the process of negotiation (such an agenda is called endogenous).
hence, the agents must decide what agenda they will use.
the agenda is important because each agent"s cumulative utility depends on the agenda; if we change the agenda then these utilities change.
here the term agenda refers to the order in which the issues are negotiated.
for this procedure, a key issue is the  negotiation agenda.
however, most of this work has focussed on the  sequential procedure [7, 2].
since schelling [24] first noted that the outcome of negotiation depends on the choice of negotiation procedure, much research effort has been devoted to the study of different procedures for negotiating multiple issues.
we first describe the existing work for the case of divisible issues.
work on multi-issue negotiation can be divided into two main types: that for indivisible issues and that for divisible issues.
