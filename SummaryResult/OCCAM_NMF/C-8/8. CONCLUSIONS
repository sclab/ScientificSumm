acknowledgments the authors are grateful to bo begole and anonymous  reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions which have helped improve the presentation of the paper.
the theory of operation context and the cot algorithm shall serve as new  foundations for addressing the technical challenges in existing and emerging ot applications.
real-world applications provide exciting opportunities and challenges to future ot research.
the cot algorithm has been implemented in a generic collaboration engine and used for supporting a range of novel collaborative applications [24].
the cot algorithm provides  uniformed solutions to both consistency maintenance and undo problems; it is simpler and more efficient than prior ot  control algorithms with similar capabilities; and it significantly simplifies the design of transformation functions.
the theory of  operation context is capable of capturing essential relationships and conditions for all types of operation in an ot system; it provides a new foundation for better understanding and resolving ot problems.
we have contributed the theory of operation context and the cot (context-based ot) algorithm.
