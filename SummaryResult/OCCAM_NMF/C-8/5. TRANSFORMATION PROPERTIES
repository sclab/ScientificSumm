in the  following section, we extend the basic cot algorithm to provide simple and efficient solutions to cp2, ip2 and ip3 at the control algorithm level.
clearly, solving cp2, ip2 and ip3 at the control algorithm level has the benefit of simplifying the design of  transformation functions and the ot system as a whole.
it functions capable of preserving ip2 and ip3 had been devised in the context of anyundo [21], but our experience in implementing these functions revealed that those solutions are quick intricate and inefficient (more analysis can be found in section 7).
counterexamples illustrating the violation of these properties in some early published transformation functions can be found in [23, 21, 8, 11].
past research has shown that it is relatively easy to  design transformation functions capable of preserving cp1, but non-trivial to design and formally prove transformation functions capable of preserving cp2, ip2 and ip3.
284 there are generally two ways to achieve ot correctness with respect to these transformation properties: one is to design transformation functions capable of preserving these properties; the other is to design control algorithms capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties.
4 there is another inverse property 1 (ip1) that is required in an ot system for achieving the correct undo effect [21], but ip1 is not related to it functions.
3 convergence property 1 & 2 in this paper (and in [21]) are the same as transformation property 1 & 2 in [19].
4. pc-ip3: ip3 is required only if the ot system allows an inverse operation oa to be transformed against  another operation ob that is context-independent of oa.
3. pc-ip2: ip2 is required only if the ot system allows an operation ox to be transformed against a pair of do and undo operations (o and o) one-by-one.
2. pc-cp2: cp2 is required only if the ot system  allows an operation to be transformed against the same group of context-independent operations in different orders.
to explore alternative solutions to these properties, we explicitly state the pre-conditions (pc) for cp1, cp2, ip2, and ip3 as follows: 1. pc-cp1: cp1 is required only if the ot system  allows the same group of context-independent operations to be executed in different orders.
the pre-conditions for requiring them, however, were never explicitly stated in their specifications, which has unfortunately caused quite some misconceptions in ot  literature.
the above transformation properties are important  discoveries of past research, but they are not unconditionally required.
given two operations oa and ob, if oa := it(oa, ob), ob := it(ob, oa), and oa := it(oa, ob), then it must be: oa = oa, which means the transformed inverse operation oa is equal to the inverse of the transformed operation oa.
4. inverse property 3 (ip3).
given any operation ox and a pair of operations [o, o], it must be: it(it(ox, o), o) = it(ox, i) = ox, which means that [o, o] and i are equivalent with  respect to the effect in transformation.
3. inverse property 2 (ip2)4 .
given three  operations o, oa and ob, if oa = it(oa, ob) and ob = it(ob, oa), then it must be: it(it(o, oa), ob) = it(it(o, ob), oa), which means that [oa, ob] and [ob, oa] are equivalent with respect to the effect in transformation.
2. convergence property 2 (cp2).
[ob, oa], which means that [oa, ob] and [ob, oa] are equivalent with respect to the effect on the document state ds.
[oa, ob] = ds ?
given a  document state ds, and operations oa, ob, if oa = it(oa, ob), and ob = it(ob, oa), then it must be: ds ?
1. convergence property 1 (cp1)3 .
the makeinverse(o) procedure directly  follows these definitions.
similar to goto-anyundo, the basic cot algorithm assumes that underlying transformation functions are  capable of preserving the following properties [4, 15, 19, 23, 21]: 2 the reader is referred to [25] for precise definitions of three primitive operations insert, delete and update and their  corresponding inverses.
unlike goto-anyundo, the basic cot algorithm does not use et (exclusion transformation) functions [21], thus avoiding the requirement of the reversibility property (rp) between it and et functions [21].
different ot  systems may have different control algorithms, different  transformation functions, and different divisions of  responsibilities among these components.
past research has identified a range of  transformation properties/conditions that must be maintained for ensuring the correctness of an ot system.
another important component of an ot system is the low-level transformation functions  responsible for transforming operations according to their types and parameters.
cot is a high-level control algorithm responsible for  determining which operation should be transformed against other operations and in which order according to  contextbased conditions.
