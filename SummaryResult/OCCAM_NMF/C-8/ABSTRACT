we have implemented the cot algorithm in a generic  collaboration engine and used it for supporting a range of novel collaborative applications.
the cot algorithm is capable of supporting both do and undo of any  operations at anytime, without requiring transformation functions to preserve reversibility property, convergence property 2, inverse properties 2 and 3. the cot algorithm is not only simpler and more efficient than prior ot control algorithms, but also simplifies the design of transformation functions.
in this paper, we report the main  results of this effort: the theory of operation context and the cot (context-based ot) algorithm.
after having designed, implemented, and experimented with a series of ot algorithms, we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a new  theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving ot problems, reducing its complexity, and supporting its continual evolution.
past research had invented various patches to work around this problem, resulting in increasingly intricate and complicated ot algorithms.
the theory of causality has been the foundation of all prior ot systems, but it is  inadequate to capture essential correctness requirements.
the theoretical foundation for ot is crucial in determining its capability to solve existing and new problems, as well as the quality of those solutions.
operational transformation (ot) is a technique for  consistency maintenance and group undo, and is being applied to an increasing number of collaborative applications.
