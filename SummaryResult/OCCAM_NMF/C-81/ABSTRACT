our methods are evaluated using data gathered from a prototype solar energy harvesting platform and we show that our algorithm can utilize up to 58% more environmental energy compared to the case when harvesting-aware power management is not used.
we also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source.
we present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data.
the algorithm has three objectives, namely (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment, (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above  energyneutrality constraint, and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time.
in this paper, we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty cycle according to the energy availability in the environment.
harvesting energy from the environment is feasible in many applications to ameliorate the energy limitations in sensor networks.
