our proposed techniques attempt to maximize system performance while maintaining energy-neutral operation. 
while these works did demonstrate that environment aware decisions improve performance compared to battery aware decisions, their objective was not to achieve energy neutral operation.
the first work to take environmental energy into account for data routing was [17], followed by [18].
while several energy harvesting sensor node platforms have been prototyped [14], [15], [16], there is a need for systematic power management techniques that provide performance guarantees during system operation.
several technologies to extract energy from the environment have been demonstrated including solar, motion-based, biochemical, vibration-based [8], [9], [10], [11], and others are being developed [12], [13].
energy harvesting has been explored for several different types of systems, such as wearable computers [4], [5], [6], sensor networks [7], etc.
