we will use duty cycle adjustment as the primitive performance scaling technique in our algorithms. 
in addition, the rate of duty cycling is directly related to system performance metrics such as network latency and sampling frequency.
low power devices typically provide at least one low power mode in which the node is shut down and the power consumption is negligible.
alternatively, a common performance scaling technique is duty cycling.
however, these techniques require hardware support and may not always be available on resource constrained sensor nodes.
there exist many techniques to accomplish performance scaling at the node level, such as radio transmit power adjustment [1], dynamic voltage scaling [2], and the use of low power modes [3].
in this paper, we will study how to adapt the performance of the available energy profile.
energy harvesting systems, on the other hand, can provide enhanced performance depending on the available energy.
consequently, battery powered systems usually operate at the lowest performance level that meets the minimum data fidelity requirement in order to maximize the system life.
in addition, most power management schemes designed for battery-powered systems only account for the dynamics of the energy consumers (e.g., cpu, radio) but not the dynamics of the energy supply.
thus, power management methods based on battery status are not always applicable to energy harvesting systems.
second, there is an uncertainty associated with its availability and measurement, compared to the energy stored in the battery which can be known deterministically.
first it is an inexhaustible supply which, if appropriately used, can allow the system to last forever, unlike the battery which is a limited resource.
environmental energy is distinct from battery energy in two ways.
however, metrics for evaluating energy harvesting systems are different from those used for battery powered systems.
therefore, harvesting energy from the environment has been proposed to supplement or completely replace battery supplies to enhance system lifetime and reduce the maintenance cost of replacing batteries periodically.
the fidelity of the data produced by a sensor network begins to degrade once sensor nodes start to run out of battery power.
energy supply has always been a crucial issue in designing battery-powered wireless sensor networks because the lifetime and utility of the systems are limited by how long the batteries are able to sustain the operation.
