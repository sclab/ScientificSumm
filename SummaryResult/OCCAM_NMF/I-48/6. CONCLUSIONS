[1]), and to consider other classes of allowable goals. 
an obvious issue is to consider is the complexity of the questions we give for more practical  representations of models (cf.
of course, our approach is in many senses open for extension or enrichment.
we have proposed a logical framework to reason about such scenarios, and we have given some computational costs for settling some of the main  questions about them.
game theory is a very natural tool to analyse and answer these questions, which involve strategic considerations, and we have  proposed a way to translate key questions concerning logic-based  normative systems to game theoretical questions.
and, for a system designer, how to be sure that the system will behave socially, that is, according to its norm.
the question then, for an agent is, how to be sure that others will comply with a norm.
of course, such a restriction does not have to be bad: the fact that an agent"s behaviour is restricted may seem a limitation, but there may be  benefits if he can assume that others will also constrain their behaviour.
social norms are supposed to restrict our behaviour.
