similarly, we have η3 {1} = {(s, s)} and η3 {1} = {(t, t)}. 
(continued) we have η1 {1} = η1 = {(s, s)}, while η1 {1} = η∅ = η1 {2}.
example 1.
note that we have η c = η (a\c) and η c = η (a\c).
thus k † (η c) is the kripke structure that results if only the agents in c choose not to comply with the normative system (i.e., the only ones who comply are those in a \ c).
• η c denotes the normative system that is the same as η  except that it only contains the arcs of η that do not correspond to actions of agents in c. we call η c the exclusion of c from η, and it is defined as: η c = {(s, s ) : (s, s ) ∈ η & α(s, s ) ∈ c}.
thus k † (η c) is the kripke structure that results if only the agents in c choose to comply with the normative system.
formally, let k = s, s0 ,r, a,α, v be a kripke structure, let c ⊆ a be a set of agents over k, and let η be a normative system over k. then: • η c denotes the normative system that is the same as η except that it only contains the arcs of η that correspond to the actions of agents in c. we call η c the restriction of η to c, and it is defined as: η c = {(s, s ) : (s, s ) ∈ η & α(s, s ) ∈ c}.
in this context, it is useful to define operators on normative systems which correspond to groups of agents defecting from the  normative system.
later, we will address the issue of whether or not agents should rationally choose to comply with a particular normative system.
let us, for later reference, fix η1 = {(s, s)}, η2 = {(t, t)}, and η3 = {(s, s), (t, t)}.
a normative system with (s, t) would not be fair, in the sense that a♦a ¬p1 ∨ a♦a ¬p2 holds: in all paths, from some moment on, one agent will have control forever.
(continued) when thinking in terms of fairness, it seems natural to consider normative systems η that contain (s, s) or (t, t).
notice that for all k, we have k † η∅ = k. example 1.
if k is a kripke  structure, and η is a normative system over k, then k † η denotes the kripke structure obtained from k by deleting transitions forbidden in η. formally, if k = s, s0 , r, a, α, v , and η ∈ n (r), then let k†η = k be the kripke structure k = s , s0 , r , a , α , v where: • s = s , s0 = s0 , a = a , and v = v ; • r = r \ η; and • α is the restriction of α to r : α (s, s ) = j α(s, s ) if (s, s ) ∈ r undefined otherwise.
note that the empty normative system η∅ is reasonable with respect to any transition relation r. the effect of implementing a normative system on a kripke  structure is to eliminate from it all transitions that are forbidden  according to this normative system (see [15, 1]).
we denote the empty normative system by η∅, so η∅ = ∅.
let n (r) = {η : (η ⊆ r) & (r \ η is total)} be the set of normative systems over r. the intended  interpretation of a normative system η is that (s, s ) ∈ η means transition (s, s ) is forbidden in the context of η; hence r \ η denotes the legal transitions of η. since it is assumed η is reasonable, we are guaranteed that a legal outward transition exists for every state.
the requirement that r\η is total is a  reasonableness constraint: it prevents normative systems which lead to states with no successor.
a kripke structure k = s, s0 , r, a, α, v ) is simply a subset of r, such that r \ η is a total relation.
formally, a normative system η (w.r.t.
different normative systems may differ on whether or not a transition is legal.
more precisely, a  normative system defines, for every possible system transition, whether or not that transition is considered to be legal or not.
for our purposes, a normative system is simply a set of constraints on the behaviour of agents in a system [1].
