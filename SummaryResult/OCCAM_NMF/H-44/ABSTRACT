results unequivocally show that our methods make it  possible to build an efficient time machine scalable to large versioned text collections.
finally, our approach is evaluated in a comprehensive  series of experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets.
these techniques can be formulated as  optimization problems that can be solved to near-optimality.
in order to further improve the performance of time-travel queries, we  introduce two principled techniques to trade off index size for its performance.
we introduce approximate temporal coalescing as a tunable method to reduce the index size without  significantly affecting the quality of results.
as a consequence, there is no scalable and principled solution to search such a collection as of a  specified time t. in this work, we address this shortcoming and propose an efficient solution for time-travel text search by extending the inverted file index to make it ready for  temporal search.
text search over temporally versioned document collections such as web archives has received little attention as a  research problem.
