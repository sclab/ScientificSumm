it should be noted that index-pruning techniques can be adapted to work along with the temporal text index we propose here. 
they also do not consider temporal aspects of documents, and thus are  technically quite different from our proposal despite having a shared goal of index-size reduction.
static  indexpruning techniques [11, 12] aim to reduce the effective index size, by removing portions of the index that are expected to have low impact on the query result.
none of the  approaches, however, considers time explicitly or provides the desired time-travel text search functionality.
[17] and zhang and suel [34] exploit arbitrary content overlaps between documents to reduce index size.
more recent approaches by hersovici et al.
their technique makes strong assumptions about the structure of document overlaps rendering it inapplicable to our context.
[8] describe a technique that exploits large content overlaps between documents to achieve a reduction in index size.
moving on to the second category of related work, broder et al.
unlike the inverted file  index, their applicability to text search is not well understood.
in contrast, research in temporal databases has produced several index structures tailored for time-evolving databases; a comprehensive overview of the state-of-art is available in [28].
this  adaptation, however, does not provide the intended time-travel text search functionality.
stack [29] reports practical experiences made when adapting the open source search-engine nutch to search web archives.
recent work by nørv˚ag and nybø [25] and their earlier proposals concentrate on the relatively simpler problem of supporting text-containment queries only and neglect the relevance scoring of results.
burrows and hisgen [10], in a patent description, delineate a method for indexing range-based values and mention its potential use for searching based on dates associated with documents.
access costs are optimized for accesses to the most recent versions and increase as one moves farther into the past.
anick and flynn [3], while pioneering this research, describe a help-desk system that supports historical queries.
to the best of our knowledge, there is very little prior work dealing with historical search over temporally versioned  documents.
we briefly review work under these categories here.
we can classify the related work mainly into the following two categories: (i) methods that deal explicitly with  collections of versioned documents or temporal databases, and (ii) methods for reducing the index size by exploiting either the document-content overlap or by pruning portions of the index.
