as a consequence, existing query-processing  techniques and most optimizations (e.g., compression techniques) remain equally applicable. 
we note that our proposed extension of the inverted file index makes no assumptions about the sort-order of  index lists.
as a remedy, we propose index organization techniques in section 6 that aim to reduce the i/o overhead significantly.
whether a posting can be skipped can only be decided after the posting has been  transferred from disk into memory and therefore still incurs  significant i/o cost.
to this end, sequential reading is extended by skipping all postings whose validity time-interval does not contain t (i.e., t âˆˆ [tb, te)).
we transparently extend the  sequential reading, which is - to the best of our  knowledgecommon to all query processing techniques on inverted file indexes, thus making them suitable for time-travel  queryprocessing.
then, index lists are  sequentially read from disk, thereby accumulating the information contained in the postings.
4.3 query processing during processing of a time-travel query q t , for each query term the corresponding idf-score valid at time t is retrieved from the extended vocabulary.
therefore, we take a simplified approach to idf-score maintenance, by  computing idf-scores for all terms in the corpus at specific (possibly periodic) times.
unlike the tf-score, the idf-score of every term could vary with every change in the corpus.
similarly, the extended vocabulary structure maintains for each term a time-series of idf-scores organized as a  b+tree.
as a concrete example, in our implementation, for a  version dti having the okapi bm25 tf-score wtf (v, dti ) for term v, the index list lv contains the posting ( d, wtf (v, dti ), [ti, ti+1) ) .
the postings in our time-travel inverted file index are thus of the form ( d, p, [tb, te) ) where d and p are defined as in the standard inverted file index above and [tb, te) is the validity time-interval.
the main idea for inverted lists is that we include a validity  timeinterval [tb, te) in postings to denote when the payload  information was valid.
4.2 time-travel inverted file index in order to prepare an inverted file index for time travel we extend both inverted lists and the vocabulary structure by explicitly incorporating temporal information.
for an excellent recent survey about inverted file indexes we  refer to [35].
a variety of compression techniques, such as encoding document identifiers more compactly, have been proposed [33, 35] to reduce the size of index lists.
frequencyorder and impact-order sorted index lists are beneficial for ranked queries and enable optimized query processing that stops early after having identified the k most relevant  documents [1, 2, 9, 15, 31].
for boolean queries it is  favorable to sort index lists in document-order.
the sort-order of index lists depends on which queries are to be supported efficiently.
the payload p contains information about the term frequency of v in d, but may also include positional  information about where the term appears in the document.
the index list lv belonging to term v contains postings of the form ( d, p ) where d is a document-identifier and p is the so-called  payload.
4.1 inverted file index an inverted file index consists of a vocabulary, commonly organized as a b+-tree, that maps each term to its  idfscore and inverted list.
in this section, we briefly review this technique and present our extensions to the inverted file index that make it ready for time-travel text search.
the inverted file index is a standard technique for text indexing, deployed in many systems.
