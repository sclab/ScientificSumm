for instance, it might be  relevant in several application scenarios to design algorithms that can find a selling strategy when several copies of the same item are available for selling, and when moreover the auctioneer is satisfied when at least a given number of copies is actually sold.
finally, an other interesting question is to assess whether the structural decomposition techniques discussed in the  paper can be used to efficiently deal with generalizations of the winner determination problem.
as a further avenue of research, it would be relevant to enhance the algorithm computesetpackingk, e.g., by using specialized data structures, in order to avoid the quadratic dependency from (|e(h)| + 1)k .
in the light of this observation, we note that proving some  approximability results for structured item graphs requires a deep understanding of the approximability of query  decompositions, which is currently missing in the literature.
in particular, the latter result is established by showing a precise relationship between structured item graphs and restricted forms of hypertree decompositions (on the dual hypergraph), called query decompositions (see, e.g., [7]).
interestingly, it also emerged that the class of structured item graphs is properly contained in the class of instances having bounded hypertree width (hence, the reason of their intractability is not their generality).
for some special, yet relevant cases, a highly parallelizable algorithm is also discussed.
the result is bad news, since it turned out that it is np-complete to check whether a combinatorial auction has a structured item graph, even for treewidth 3. motivated by this result, we  investigated the use of hypertree decomposition (on the dual hypergraph associated with the scenario) and we shown that the problem is tractable on the class of those instances whose dual hypergraphs have bounded hypertree width.
we have solved the open question of determining the complexity of computing a structured item graph  associated with a combinatorial auction scenario.
