then, ¯h has a k-width strict hypertree decomposition if and only if k marshals can win the strict robber and marshals game on ¯h, no matter of the robber"s moves. 
theorem 8. let h be a hypergraph such that for each node v ∈ n(h), {v} is in e(h).
otherwise, the robber wins.
the marshals win the game if they capture the robber, by occupying an edge covering a node where the robber is.
importantly, marshals are required to play monotonically, i.e., they cannot occupy an edge that was previously  occupied in the game, and which is currently not.
note that in the basic game defined in [6], the robber is not allowed to move on vertices that are occupied by the marshals before and after their move, even if they do not belong to blocked hyperedges.
marshals move on the hyperedges of h, while the robber moves on nodes of h. the robber sees where the marshals intend to move, and reacts by moving to another node which is connected with its current position and through a path in g(h) which does not use any node contained in a hyperedge that is occupied by the marshals before and after their move-we say that these hyperedges are blocked.
the game is played on a hypergraph h by a robber against k marshals which act in coordination.
we shed further lights on strict hypertree decompositions by discussing an interesting characterization based on the strict robber and marshals game, defined by adapting the robber and marshals game defined in [6], which characterizes hypertree width.
a game theoretic view.
theorem 7. c(ig, k) = c(shw, k + 1) ⊂ c(hw, k + 1).
in fact, we are able to show that the additional conditions in definition 2 induce an actual restriction on the decomposition power.
by definition, strict hypertree decompositions are special hypertree decompositions.
159 weighted-set packing problems) have strict hypertree width bounded by k, we have that c(shw, k + 1) = c(ig, k).
in fact, if this hyperedge is not in the hypergraph, then it can be added without loss of generality, by setting w({v}) = 0. therefore, letting c(shw, k) denote the class of all the  hypergraphs whose dual hypergraphs (associated with maximum 2 the term +1 only plays the technical role of taking care of the different definition of width for tree decompositions and hypertree decompositions.
note that, as far as the maximum weighted-set packing problem is concerned, given a hypergraph h, we can always assume that for each node v ∈ n(h), {v} is in e(h).
then, a k-width tree  decomposition of an item graph for h exists if and only if ¯h has a (k + 1)-width strict hypertree decomposition2 .
theorem 6. let h be a hypergraph such that for each node v ∈ n(h), {v} is in e(h).
p the basic relationship between nice hypertree  decompositions and structured item graphs is shown in the following theorem.
cr ∩ χ(ts) = ∅, cr is a [χ(r) ∩ n(λ(r) ∩ λ(s))]-component; 2. for each edge h ∈ e(h), there is a vertex p such that h ∈ λ(p) and h ⊆ χ(p) (we say p strongly covers h); 3. for each edge h ∈ e(h), the set {p ∈ vertices(t) | h ∈ λ(p)} induces a (connected) subtree of t. the strict hypertree width shw(h) of h is the minimum width over all its strict hypertree decompositions.
definition 2. a hypertree decomposition hd = t, χ, λ of h is strict if the following conditions hold: 1. for each pair of vertices r and s in vertices(t) such that s is a child of r, and for each [χ(r)]-component cr s.t.
for any [v ]-component c, let e(c) = {h ∈ e(h) | h ∩ c = ∅}.
a [v ]-component is a maximal [v ]-connected non-empty set of nodes w ⊆ (n(h) − v ).
a set w ⊆ n(h) of nodes is [v ]-connected if ∀x, y ∈ w there is a [v ]-path from x to y .
, x = y of variables such that: xi is [v ]-adjacent to xi+1, for each i ∈ [0... -1].
a [v ]-path π from x to y is a sequence x = x0, .
x is [v ]-adjacent to y if there exists an edge h ∈ e(h) such that {x, y } ⊆ (h − v ).
4.1 strict hypertree decompositions let h be a hypergraph, and let v ⊆ n(h) be a set of nodes and x, y ∈ n(h).
then, the result will follow by proving that k-width strict hypertree decompositions are less powerful than  kwith hypertree decompositions.
the line of the proof is to first show that structured item graphs are in one-to-one correspondence with a special kind of hypertree decompositions of the dual hypergraph, which we shall call strict.
surprisingly, we establish this is not the case.
structured item graphs given that the class c(hw, k) has been shown to be an island of tractability for the winner determination problem, and given that the class c(ig, k) has been shown not to be efficiently recognizable, one may be inclined to think that there are instances having unbounded hypertree width, but admitting an item graph of bounded tree width (so that the intractability of structured item graphs would lie in their generality).
