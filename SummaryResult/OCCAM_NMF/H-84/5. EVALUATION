note that the direction of dependency is important in comparison.

¯ cluster recall(cr): it is the probability that two randomly selected stories × and × are in the same system-event given that they are in the same true event.
è è´ ´× µ ´× µ ¼´× µ ¼´× µµ ´åµ ´å¼µ ´å¼µ (7) where ¼ is the story-event mapping function corresponding to the model å¼.
¯ cluster precision (cp): it is the probability that two  randomly selected stories × and × are in the same true-event given that they are in the same system event.
given these two sets of story pairs corresponding to the true event model å and the system event model å¼, we define recall and precision for each category as follows.
as we mentioned  earlier in section 3, ignoring the direction may make the  problem simpler, but we will lose the expressiveness of our  representation.

¯ dependency pairs ( ´åµ): these are the set of all ordered pairs of stories ´× × µ such that there is a dependency from the event of × to the event of × in the model å.
specifically, we compare two kinds of story pairs: ¯ cluster pairs ( ´åµ): these are the complete set of  unordered pairs ´× × µ of stories × and × that fall within the same event given a model å. formally, ´åµ ´× × µ × × ¾ ë ´× µ ´× µ (5) where is the function in å that maps stories to events as defined in equation 4.
hence instead of comparing the actual structure we examine a pair of stories at a time and verify if the system and true labels agree on their event-memberships and  dependencies.
and different event granularities may bring huge discrepancy between å¼ and å. this is certainly non-trivial as even testing whether two graphs are isomorphic has no known polynomial time solution.
comparing a system event model å¼ with the true model å requires comparing the entire event models including their  dependency structure.
a system can generate some event model å¼ ´ ¼ ¼µ using certain algorithms, which is usually different from the truth model å ´ µ (we assume the annotator did not make any  mistake).
