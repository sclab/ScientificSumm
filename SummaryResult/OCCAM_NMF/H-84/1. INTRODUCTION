section 8 concludes the paper with a few observations on our results and comments on future work.
in  section 7 we present our experiments and results.
section 5 presents our evaluation techniques while section 6  describes the techniques we use for modeling event structure.
in section 4, we describe how we built the corpus for our problem.
in section 3, we define the problem and use an example to illustrate threading of events within a news topic.
in section 2, we discuss related work.
the rest of the paper is organized as follows.
from a user"s perspective, we believe that our view of a news topic as a set of interconnected events helps him/her get a quick overview of the topic and also allows him/her navigate through the topic faster.
although this paper focuses on threading events within an existing news topic, we expect that such event based dependency structure more accurately reflects the structure of news than strictly bounded topics do.
we refer to the  resulting interconnected structure of events as the event model of the topic.
we call the  process of recognizing events and identifying dependencies among them event threading, an analogy to email threading that shows connections between related email messages.
by structure, we mean not only identifying the events that make up a topic, but also establishing dependencies-generally causal-among them.
in this work we investigate methods for modeling the structure of a topic in terms of its events.
in the above example, the event of rescue attempts is ‘influenced" by the event of bombing and so is the event of search for perpetrators.
we see that there is a pattern of dependencies between pairs of events in the topic.
other events in the topic may include the rescue attempts, the search for perpetrators, arrests and trials and so on.
for example, when a bomb explodes in a building, that is the seminal event that triggers the topic.
this is indeed recognized by tdt which defines a topic as ‘a set of news stories that are strongly related by some seminal  realworld event" where an event is defined as ‘something that happens at a specific time and location" [3].
however, a topic in news is more than a mere collection of stories: it is characterized by a definite structure of inter-related events.
for example, the detection task of tdt is to arrange a collection of news stories into clusters of topics.
one of the shortcomings of current tdt evaluation is its view of news topics as flat collection of stories.
this problem is  addressed by a research program called topic detection and tracking (tdt) [3] that runs an open annual competition on standardized tasks of news organization.
hence there is an increasing need for automatic techniques to organize news stories in a way that helps users interpret and analyze them quickly.
common people and news analysts alike are very interested in keeping abreast of new things that happen in the news, but it is becoming very difficult to cope with the huge volumes of information that arrives each day.
news forms a major portion of information disseminated in the world everyday.
