acknowledgments we would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.
we also hope to expand our labeled corpus further to include more diverse news sources and larger and more complex event structures.
we also hope to devise an iterative algorithm which can improve clustering and dependency performance alternately as suggested by one of the reviewers.
and for modeling dependencies, a probabilistic framework should be a better choice since there is no definite  answer of yes/no for the causal relations among some events.
as part of our future work, we plan to investigate further into the data and discover new features that influence clustering as well as dependencies.
hence, we should focus not only on improving dependencies but also on clustering at the same time.
errors in clustering have a magnifying effect on errors in  dependencies as we have seen in our experiments.
our results indicate modeling dependencies can be a very hard problem especially when the clustering performance is below ideal level.
despite that discouraging result, we have shown that our combined  algorithms perform significantly better than the baselines.
however, the performance deteriorates rapidly if the system has to discover the events by itself.
our experiments also show that we can do fairly well on dependencies using only surface-features such as  cosinesimilarity and time-stamps of news stories as long as true events are provided to the system.
we developed a  timedecay based clustering approach that takes advantage of  temporallocalization of news stories on the same event and showed that it performs significantly better than the baseline approach based on cosine similarity.
in this paper, we also proposed a few approaches for both clustering stories into events and constructing dependencies among them.
contrary to the tdt view of topics as flat  collection of news stories, we view a news topic as a relational structure of events interconnected by dependencies.
in this paper, we have presented a new perspective of modeling news topics.
