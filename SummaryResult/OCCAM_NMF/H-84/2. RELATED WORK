other  related work that dealt with analysis within a news topic includes temporal summarization of news topics [4]. 
however, the paper stopped short of proposing any models to the problem.
in a work closest to ours, makkonen [8] suggested modeling news topics in terms of its evolving events.
however this structure still did not  explicitly model any dependencies between events.
however, in tdt-2003, a hierarchical structure of topic detection has been proposed and [2] made useful attempts to adopt the new structure.
in tdt, researchers have traditionally considered topics as  flatclusters [1].
also their algorithms are tuned to work on specific genres of topics such as earthquakes, accidents, etc., while we expect our algorithms to generalize over any topic.
our work differs from theirs in that we do not  constrain the dependency to be linear.
barzilay and lee [5] proposed a content structure modeling technique where topics within text are learnt using unsupervised methods, and a linear order of these topics is modeled using hidden markov models.
the hierarchy within a topic does impose a structure on the topic, but we do not know of an effort to explore the extent to which that structure  reflects the underlying event relationships.
another area of research that looks at the structure within a topic is hierarchical text classification of topics [9, 6].
email threading captures reference dependencies between messages and does not attempt to reflect any underlying real-world structure of the matter under discussion.
email usually incorporates a strong structure of referenced messages and  consistently formatted subject headings-though information retrieval techniques are useful when the structure breaks down [7].
the process of threading events together is related to threading of electronic mail only by name for the most part.
