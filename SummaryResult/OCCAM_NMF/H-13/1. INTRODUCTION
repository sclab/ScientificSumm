in addition, we believe our methodology may be generalized to other search  applications when sufficient clickthrough data is available. 
this and other queries produce  captions that exhibit similar variations.
the query in 1 www.dmoz.org figure 1 produces results with similar relevance on the other major search engines.
nonetheless, given the similarity of caption formats across the major web search engines we believe the results are applicable to these other engines.
the experiments reported in later sections are based on  windows live query logs, result pages and relevance judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine  performance [1,2].
the image in  figure 1 was captured from windows live and cropped to  eliminate branding, advertising and navigational elements.
the work reported in this paper was undertaken in the context of the windows live search engine.
a url before re-direction may be shorter and provide a clearer idea of the final destination.
a title extracted from the body may provide greater coverage of the query terms.
a snippet from a web  directory may consist of complete sentences and be less  fragmentary than an extracted snippet.
when these alternative snippets, titles and urls are  available, the selection of an appropriate combination for display may be guided by their features.
moreover, for pages listed in human-edited web directories such as the open directory project1 , it may be possible to display alternative titles and snippets derived from these listings.
for links that re-direct, it may be possible to display alternative urls.
the title may be taken from the html header or extracted from the body of the document [8].
the correct choice of snippet may depend on aspects of both the query and the result page.
snippets may be generated in a query-independent fashion,  providing a summary of the page as a whole, or in a  querydependent fashion, providing a summary of how the page relates to the query terms.
different caption generation algorithms might select  snippets of different lengths from different areas of a page.
by better understanding their influence, better judgments may result.
in addition, these features can play a role in the process of inferring relevance judgments from user behavior [1].
captions themselves.
understanding this influence may help to validate algorithms and guidelines for the improved generation of the figure 1: top three results for the query: kids online games.
in this paper, we examine the influence of caption  features on user"s web search behavior, using clickthroughs extracted from search engines logs as our primary  investigative tool.
unfortunately, these page characteristics are not entirely  reflected in the captions.
the third result might be somewhat disappointing to a user, since it leads to only a single game, hosted at the centers for disease control, that could not reasonably be described as online.
despite appearances, the second result links to a surprisingly large collection of  online games, primarily with environmental themes.
homepage, but it is then necessary to follow a link in a menu to find the main page for games.
the first result links to the main yahoo kids!
all three of the results in figure 1 are relevant, with some limitations.
even worse, the user may be misled into skipping a page that contains desired  information.
when it fails, the user may waste her time clicking through to an inappropriate result and scanning a page containing little or nothing of interest.
when this judgment is correct, it can speed the search process by allowing the user to avoid unwanted material.
but in the case of an informational query, the title and snippet may be necessary to guide the user in selecting a page for further study, and she may judge the relevance of a page on the basis of the caption alone.
in the case of a navigational query - particularly when the destination is well known - the url alone may be sufficient to identify the desired page.
a principal motivation for providing a caption is to assist the user in determining the relevance of the associated page without actually having to click through to the result.
while these differences may seem minor, they may also have a substantial impact on user behavior.
the snippet of the first caption consists of a complete sentence that  concisely describes the associated page, while the snippet of the third caption consists of two incomplete sentences that are largely unrelated to the overall contents of the associated page and to the apparent intent of the query.
all of the query terms appear in the url of the third caption, while none appear in the url of the first caption.
one of the query terms is repeated in the first caption.
the title of the third caption contains all of the query terms in order, while the titles of the first and second captions contain only two of the three terms.
the snippet of the third caption is nearly twice as long as that of the first, while the snippet is missing entirely from the second caption.
while the three captions share the same basic structure, their content differs in several respects.
figure 1 shows a typical web search, with captions for the top three results.
often the snippet is extracted from the web page itself, but it may also be taken from external sources, such as the human-generated summaries found in web directories.
each search result is described by a brief caption, comprising the url of the  associated web page, a title, and a brief summary (or  snippet) describing the contents of the page.
the major commercial web search engines all present their results in much the same way.
