finally, section 6 outlines how strategies and tactics use the logic framework,  intimacy and balance. 
section 5 contains a description of the different metrics used in the agent model including intimacy.
section 4 explains in outline the architecture and the concepts of intimacy and balance, and how they influence the negotiation.
then, in section 3 we introduce the negotiation language.
in section 2 we outline the aspects of human negotiation modelling that we cover in this work.
in this sense, humans aim at a general sense of fairness in an interaction.
it is common in human settings to use tactics that compensate for unbalances in one dimension of a  negotiation with unbalances in another dimension.
negotiation strategies can naturally be seen as procedures that select tactics used to attain a successful deal and to reach a target intimacy level.
we don"t follow the "co-opetition" aproach [4] where co-operation and  competition depend on the issue under negotiation, but instead we belief that the willingness to co-operate/compete affect all aspects in the negotiation process.
these two theories are too specific and distinct to describe how a (business) relationship might grow because interactions have some aspects of these two extremes on a continuum in which, for example, agents reveal increasing amounts of  private information as their intimacy grows.
at different intimacy levels).
these two concepts, intimacy and balance are key in the model, and enable us to understand competitive and co-operative game theory as two particular theories of agent relationships (i.e.
in this sense, agents are not just utility maximisers, but aim at building long lasting  relationships with progressing levels of intimacy that determine what balance in information and resource sharing is  acceptable to them.
our aim is to model trading scenarios where agents represent their human principals, and thus we want their behaviour to be comprehensible by humans and to  respect usual human negotiation procedures, whilst being  consistent with, and somehow extending, game theoretical and information theoretical results.
we  believe that if agents are to succeed in real application domains they have to reconcile both views: informational and  gametheoretical.
the model is grounded on results from business and psychological studies [1, 16, 9], and  acknowledges that negotiation is an information exchange  process as well as a utility exchange process [15, 14].
in this paper we propose a new negotiation model to deal with long term relationships that are founded on successive negotiation encounters.
