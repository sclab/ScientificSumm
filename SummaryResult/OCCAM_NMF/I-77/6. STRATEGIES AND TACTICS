if a balance bound requires negative information revelation in one logic category then α will contribute nothing to it, and will leave this to the natural decay to the reputation d as described above. 
a less neurotic tactic could attempt to achieve the target negotiation balance over the anticipated complete  dialogue.
a cautious tactic could use the balance to bound the  response μ to each utterance μ from β by the constraint: vα(μ ) vβ(μ) ≈ st αβ ⊗ (nα(ψt ) nβ(ψt )), where ⊗ is element-by-element matrix multiplication, and st αβ is the stance.
this gives a negotiation balance target of: nα(ψt ) nβ(ψt ) that can be used as the foundation for reactive tactics by  striving to maintain this balance across the logic dimensions.
it is reasonable to  expect β to progress towards her target at the same rate and nα(ψt ) is calculated by replacing β by α in equation 6. nα(ψt ) is what α hopes to receive from β during ψt .
i"ll pass a bit more information on options than usual, i"ll be stronger in concessions on options, etc.).
following from equation 5, α will want to achieve a negotiation target, nβ(ψt ) such that: ν · nβ(ψt ) + (1 − ν) · v ∗t β is a bit on the t∗t β side of v ∗t β : nβ(ψt ) = ν − κ ν v ∗t β ⊕ κ ν t∗t β (6) for small κ ∈ [0, ν] that represents α"s desired rate of  development for her relationship with β. nβ(ψt ) is a 2 × 5 matrix containing variations in the logic dimensions that α would like to reveal to β during ψt (e.g.
suppose that the  relationship target is (t∗t α , t∗t β ).
prior  interactions with agent β will have produced an intimacy pattern expressed in the form of ` v ∗t α , v ∗t β ´ .
negotiation tactics are concerned with selecting some  options and wrapping them in argumentation.
this is achieved by increasing the value of s in equation 1. the  following strategy uses the machinery described in section 4. fix h, g, s and c, set the options to the empty set, let dt s = {δ | pt (acc(α, β, χ, δ) > c}, then: • repeat the following as many times as desired: add δ = arg maxx{pt (acc(β, α, x)) | x ∈ dt s} to options, remove {y ∈ dt s | sim(y, δ) < k} for some k from dt s by using pt (acc(β, α, δ)) this strategy reacts to β"s history of propose and reject utterances.
in line with the comment in footnote 7, in the early stages of the  negotiation α may decide to inflate her opening options.
α perturbs the acceptance  machinery (see section 4) by deriving s from the st αβ matrix such as the value at the (i, o) position.
if the set of options is empty then α will quit the negotiation.
the negotiation strategy is concerned with maintaining a working set of options.
the value in the (x, y) position in the matrix, where x = i, u and y = l, o, g, i, c, is chosen at random from [ 1 l(i∗t αβ ,x,y) , l(i∗t αβ, x, y)] where l(i∗t αβ, x, y) is the bound, and i∗t αβ is the intimacy.
the stance, st αβ, is a 2 × 5 matrix of randomly chosen multipliers, each ≈ 1, that perturbs α"s actions.
the stance is shown in figure 1, it injects bounded random noise into the process, where the bound tightens as intimacy increases.
the  required variation of behaviour is normally described as  varying the negotiation stance that informally varies from  friendly guy to tough guy.
we now describe in greater detail the contents of the  negotiation box in figure 1. the negotiation literature  consistently advises that an agent"s behaviour should not be predictable even in close, intimate relationships.
second it will aim to contribute to the growth, or decline, of the relationship intimacy.
first it may be intended to achieve some contractual outcome.
each negotiation has to achieve two goals.
