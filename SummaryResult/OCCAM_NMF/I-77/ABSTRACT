categories and subject descriptors i.2.11 [artificial intelligence]: distributed artificial  intelligence-multiagent systems general terms theory 
the negotiation strategy maintains a set of options that are in-line with the current intimacy level, and then tactics wrap the options in argumentation with the aim of attaining a successful deal and  manipulating the successive negotiation balances towards the target intimacy.
a relationship strategy maintains a target intimacy for each relationship that an agent would like the relationship to move towards in future.
the balance is the difference between these  matrices.
the intimacy is a pair of matrices that  evaluate both an agent"s contribution to the relationship and its opponent"s contribution each from an information view and from a utilitarian view across the five logic  dimensions.
we introduce a  negotiation model based on these dimensions and on two primitive concepts: intimacy (degree of closeness) and balance (degree of fairness).
successful negotiators prepare by determining their position along five dimensions: legitimacy, options, goals,  independence, and commitment, (logic).
