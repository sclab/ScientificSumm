, cn) implicitly determines that ci is an instance of the concept in the i-th position of the relation r. 1032 the sixth intl.
5 we assume the convention that c(c) means that c is an instance of concept c and r(c1, .
4 without loss of generality we will assume that all actions are dialogical.
the set term contains instances of the ontology concepts and relations.5 for example, we can represent the following offer: if you spend a total of more than e100 in my shop during  october then i will give you a 10% discount on all goods in november, as: offer( α, β,spent(β, α, october, x) ∧ x ≥ e100 → ∀ y. done(inform(ξ, α, pay(β, α, y), november)) → commit(α, β, discount(y,10%))) ξ is an institution agent that reports the payment.
c is: μ ::= illoc(α, β, ϕ, t) | μ; μ | let context in μ end ϕ ::= term | done(μ) | commit(α, β, ϕ) | ϕ ∧ ϕ | ϕ ∨ ϕ | ¬ϕ | ∀v.ϕv | ∃v.ϕv context ::= ϕ | id = ϕ | prolog clause | context; context where ϕv is a formula with free variable v, illoc is any  appropriate set of illocutionary particles, ‘;" means sequencing, and context represents either previous agreements, previous illocutions, the ontological working context, that is a  projection of the ontological trees that represent the focus of the conversation, or code that aligns the ontological  differences between the speakers needed to interpret an action a. representing an ontology as a set predicates in prolog is simple.
in this way, norms, contracts, and information chunks will be represented as instances of commit(·) where α and β can be individual agents or  institutions.
α"s communication language has two fundamental  primitives: commit(α, β, ϕ) to represent, in ϕ, the world that α aims at bringing about and that β has the right to verify, complain about or claim compensation for any deviations from, and done(μ) to represent the event that a certain action μ4 has taken place.
the set of norms affecting the behaviour of an agent defines the context that the agent has to take into account.
thus, an agent has to abide by a norm while it is inside an institution, a contract has a validity period, and a piece of information is true only during an interval in time.
norms, contracts, and information have an obvious  temporal dimension.
contracts and  information can thus be thought of as normative statements that restrict an agent"s behaviour.
contracts signed by agents and  information passed by agents, are similar to norms in the sense that they oblige agents to behave in a particular way, so as to satisfy the conditions of the contract, or to make the world consistent with the information passed.
a contract δ = (a, b) between agents α and β is a pair where a and b represent the actions that agents α and β are responsible for respectively.
second, the dialogues in which α engages are built around two fundamental actions: (i) passing information, and (ii) exchanging proposals and contracts.
first, when agents interact within an overarching institution they explicitly or implicitly accept the norms that will constrain their behaviour, and accept the established sanctions and penalties whenever norms are violated.
3.2 language the shape of the language that α uses to represent the  information received and the content of its dialogues depends on two fundamental notions.
number of hops) of the  shortest path between the concepts, h is the depth of the deepest concept subsuming both concepts, and κ1 and κ2 are  parameters scaling the contributions of the shortest path length and the depth respectively.
semantic similarity is then defined as: sim(c, c ) = e−κ1l · eκ2h − e−κ2h eκ2h + e−κ2h where l is the length (i.e.
a measure [10] bases the semantic similarity  between two concepts on the path length induced by ≤ (more distance in the ≤ graph means less semantic similarity), and the depth of the subsumer concept (common ancestor) in the shortest path between the two concepts (the deeper in the hierarchy, the closer the meaning of the concepts).
how signed contracts, commit(·), about objects in a particular semantic region, and their execution, done(·), affect our decision making process about signing future contracts in nearby semantic regions is crucial to modelling the common sense that human beings apply in managing trading  relationships.
semantic distance plays a  fundamental role in strategies for information-based agency.
the semantic distance between concepts within an  ontology depends on how far away they are in the structure defined by the ≤ relation.
deals) that are defined as a tuple of issues.
r contains  relations between the concepts in the hierarchy, this is needed to define ‘objects" (e.g.
a tree for types of fabric, a tree for shapes of clothing, and so on).
to simplify  computations in the computing of probability distributions we assume that there is a number of disjoint is-a trees covering different ontological spaces (e.g.
where ≤ is the traditional is-a hierarchy.

we will omit this here.
3 usually, a set of axioms defined over the concepts and  relations is also required.
then the food intake depends more on the need of the members.
usually, food is accumulated at the shelter for future use.
2 in these societies there are family units, around a shelter, that represent the basic food sharing structure.
this is a pure equity sharing of the resources, the gain is proportional to the effort.
≤ is a reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric relation on c (a partial order) 4. σ : r → c+ is the function assigning to each relation symbol its arity 1 in its purest form, individuals in these societies collect food and consume it when and where it is found.
price(beer,aud)).3 we model  ontologies following an algebraic approach [8] as: an ontology is a tuple o = (c, r, ≤, σ) where: 1. c is a finite set of concept symbols (including basic data types); 2. r is a finite set of relation symbols; 3.
platypus is a mammal, australian-dollar is a currency), and a set of relations over these concepts (e.g.
quantity, quality, material) organised in a is-a hierarchy (e.g.
3.1 ontology in order to define a language to structure agent dialogues we need an ontology that includes a (minimum) repertoire of  elements: a set of concepts (e.g.
