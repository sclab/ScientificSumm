when both providers have the approximately same abilities to provide context, their opportunities to  provide context are equal and they can get about a half portion of the proceeds respectively. 
when one provider is obviously more appropriate than the other provider, the provider will get the right to provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds.
these experiments" results prove that our approach can choose an appropriate context provider and can provide a relatively fair proceeds allocation.
in our experiments, for similarity, we assign values to them without any particularity in advance.
these factors should be adjusted according to providers" beliefs at the beginning of each  negotiation process.
weights, time discount  function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t)) could also affect the negotiation outcome.
the average portion of proceeds a get is 0.481 and b"s average portion of the proceeds is 0.519. the average time cost on negotiation is 9.2. one thing should be mentioned is that except for d, rep, p and ep, other factors (e.g.
a and b get the right to provide context for 21 times and 23 times respectively.
the average portion of proceeds a get is 0.528 and b"s average portion of the proceeds is 0.472. the average time cost on negotiation is 10.5. experiment 3 : in this experiment, a and b also  negotiate with each other for 50 times given da, db, repa, repb (satisfying −0.2 ≤ da−db 500 − da−db 1000 ≤ 0.2) and the reserved utilities of a and b. there are 6 negotiation games  terminated forcibly.
a and b get the right to provide context for 20 times and 22 times respectively.
experiment 2 : a and b also negotiate with each other for 50 times in this experiment given different values of da, db, repa, repb (satisfying −50 ≤ ∆d = da − db ≤ 50 and −50 ≤ ∆rep = drep −drep ≤ 50) and the reserved utilities of a and b. after the experiment, we find that there are 8  negotiation games terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved utility.
the average portion of proceeds a get is about 0.683, and b"s average portion of proceeds is 0.317. the average time cost to reach agreement is 8.4. we also find that when b asks a to provide context in its first offer, b can require and get more portion of the proceeds because of its goodwill.
a gets the right to provide context for 47 times.
according to the three situations above, we make three experiments as follows: experiment 1 : in this experiment, a and b negotiate with each other for 50 times, and at each time, we assign  different values to da, db, repa, repb (satisfying da db and repa repb) and the reserved utilities of a and b. when the experiment is completed, we find 3 negotiation games are terminated due to the utility lower than the reserved utility.
the two providers" abilities to provide context information are approximately equal), we also hope that a and b get equal opportunities to provide context and allocate the proceeds evenly.
when da−db 500  approximates to da−db 1000 (i.e.
[-50,50]), a and b will get approximately equal opportunities to provide context, and allocate the proceeds evenly.
[-50,50]) and ∆rep = repa − repb is in a small range (e.g.
we hope that when da db and repa repb, a will get the right to  provide context and get a major portion of the proceeds, and when ∆d = da − db is in a small range (e.g.
the provider that starts the negotiation is chosen at random.
a and b"s utility functions and weights of c, p and ep are defined in table 1. we set deadline tdeadline = 100, and define time discount function δ(t) and concession rate function c(t) of a and b as follows: δa(t) = 0.9t δb(t) = 0.88t ca(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 0.8 cb(t) = ( t tdeadline ) 1 0.6 given different values of da, db, repa and repb, a and b negotiate to reach agreement.
we assume that both providers pay the most attention to the system"s interests, and pay the least attention to the reward, thus w1 > w2 > w3, and the weight of ud approximates the weight of urep.
we assume  reputation value is a real number and its domain is [-1000, 1000], repa represents a"s reputation value and repb represents b"s reputation value.
the domain of da and db is [0,500].
for simplicity, in our experiments, we assume that the distance has been calculated, and da represents distance between qoc requirements and a"s qoc, db  represents distance between qoc requirements and b"s qoc.
they get qoc requirements and calculate the distance between qoc requirements and their qoc.
context providers a and b negotiate to reach agreement.
in this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our  approach by simulated experiments.
