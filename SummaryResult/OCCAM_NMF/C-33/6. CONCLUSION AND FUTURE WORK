we also should deal with interactions which are interrupted by failing  communication links in the future work. 
we should solve this problem in the future.
in fact, the context provider might deceive its opponent and provide illusive promise.
we assume that the context provider will fulfill its promise of reward in the next negotiation process.
in the extended negotiation model, how to design efficient  negotiation strategies will be a challenging problem.
in the future work, this negotiation model will be extended, and more than two context providers can negotiate with each other to decide who is the most appropriate context provider.
in this paper, we only consider how to choose an  appropriate context provider from two providers.
the results of our experiments have showed that our approach can choose an appropriate context provider, and also can guarantee providers" interests by a relatively fair proceeds allocation.
distributed context providers negotiate with each other to reach  agreement on the issues who can provide the appropriate  context and how they allocate the proceeds.
in this paper, we have presented a novel approach based on negotiation with rewards to attempt to solve such problem.
how to provide the appropriate context information is a challenging problem in pervasive computing.
