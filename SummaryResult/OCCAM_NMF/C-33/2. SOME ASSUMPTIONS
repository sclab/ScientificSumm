after presenting these assumptions, we will propose our  approach based on negotiation with rewards in the next  section. 
context providers often have strict deadline by when the negotiation must be  completed.
the current  application often hopes to get context information as quickly as possible, so the time cost to reach agreement should be as short as possible.
4. since the negotiation takes place in pervasive  environments, time is a critical factors.
their utility functions are also private.
3. as context providers are independent, factors which influence their negotiation stance and behavior are  private and not available to their opponents.
the assumption is reasonable, because when an inappropriate context provider gets the right to provide bad context, as a punishment, its  reputation will decrease, and the proceeds is also very small.
after guaranteeing the  system"s interest, they can try to maximize their own  personal interests.
they should provide appropriate context information for current applications.
2. all providers must guarantee the system"s interests.
rewards confirmed in this  negotiation process will be fulfilled in the next negotiation process.
during the negotiation process, they exchange  information honestly.
before introducing our approach, we would like to give some assumptions: 1. all context providers are well-meaning and honest.
