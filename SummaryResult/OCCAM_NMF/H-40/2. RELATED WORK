in [1], the target language query log has been exploited to help query translation in clir. 
query logs have been successfully used for monolingual ir [8, 12, 15, 26], especially in monolingual query suggestions [12] and relating the semantically relevant terms for query expansion [8, 15].
therefore, clqs also plays a role of adapting the original query formulation to the common formulations of similar topics in the target language.
as clqs exploits up-to-date query logs, it is expected that for most user queries, we can find common formulations on these topics in the query log in the target language.
clqs is different from clqe in that it aims to suggest full queries that have been formulated by users in another language.
however, there is lack of a unified framework to combine the wide spectrum of resources and recent advances of mining techniques for clqe.
[18] makes performance comparison on multiple clqe techniques, including pre-translation expansion and post-translation expansion.
[16] develops a cross-lingual relevancy model by leveraging the  crosslingual co-occurrence statistics in parallel texts.
[2] reports the enhancement on clir by post-translation expansion.
this observation has led to the development of cross-lingual query expansion (clqe) techniques [2, 16, 18].
indeed, in many cases, it is helpful to introduce words even if they are not direct translations of any query word, but are closely related to the meaning of the query.
2 http://www.google.com/language_tools nevertheless, it is arguable that accurate query translation may not be necessary for clir.
in addition, word co-occurrence statistics in the target language has been leveraged for translation disambiguation [3, 10, 11, 19].
in [17], bilingual knowledge is acquired based on anchor text analysis.
in [7, 27], oov term translations are mined from the web using a search engine.
despite the various types of resources used, out-of-vocabulary (oov) words and translation disambiguation are the two major bottlenecks for clir [20].
typically, queries are translated either using a bilingual dictionary [22], a machine translation software [9] or a parallel corpus [20].
most approaches to clir perform a query translation followed by a monolingual ir.
