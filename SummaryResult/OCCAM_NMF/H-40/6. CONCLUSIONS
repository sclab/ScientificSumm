in the future, we will build clqs system between languages which may be more loosely correlated, e.g., english and chinese, and study the clqs performance change due to the less strong correspondence among queries in such languages. 
this also shows the strong correspondence between the input french queries and english queries in the log.
the improvement on trec french to english clir task by using clqs demonstrates the high quality of the suggested queries.
benchmarked using trec 6 french to english clir task, clqs demonstrates higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods using either bilingual dictionary or commercial machine translation tools.
to further test the quality of the suggested queries, clqs system is used as a query translation system in clir tasks.
by leveraging additional resources such as parallel corpora, web mining and  logbased monolingual query expansion, the final system is able to cover 42% of the relevant queries suggested by an mlqs system with precision as high as 79.6%.
this approach only covers 10% of the relevant queries suggested by an mlqs system (when the exact translation of the original query is given).
here  pvalue < 0.05 is considered statistically significant the baseline clqs system applies a typical query translation approach, using a bilingual dictionary with co-occurrence-based translation disambiguation.
(%) are the relative percentages over the monolingual ir performance table 4. the results of pair-wise significance t-test.
11 points precision-recall on trec6 clir dataset with pseudo relevance feedback table 3. comparison of average precision (ap) on trec 6 without and with post-translation expansion.

the model is trained based on the principle that cross-lingual similarity should best fit the monolingual similarity between one query and the other query"s translation.
the key solution to this problem is to learn a  crosslingual query similarity measure by a discriminative model exploiting multiple monolingual and bilingual resources.
in this paper, we proposed a new approach to cross-lingual query suggestion by mining relevant queries in different languages from query logs.
