then the retrieved documents are re-ranked based on the sum of the bm25 scores associated with each monolingual retrieval. 
then a monolingual ir system based on the bm25 model [23] is called using each }{ eqqâˆˆ as queries to retrieve documents.
given a source query fq , a set of relevant queries }{ eq in the target language are recommended using the cross-lingual query suggestion system.
the resulting good performance of clir corresponds to the high quality of the suggested queries.
in this paper, we propose to use clqs as an alternative to query translation, and test its effectiveness in clir tasks.
however, objectively benchmarking a query suggestion system is not a trivial task.
query suggestion in section 3, we presented a discriminative model for cross lingual query suggestion.
