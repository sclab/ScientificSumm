we also show, through empirical studies, that the percentage error for the proposed method is always less than 20% and, in most cases, less than 5%.
the time complexity of this method is linear in the number of players.
for other general voting games, we overcome the problem of computational complexity by presenting a new randomized method for determining the  approximate shapley value.
however, in this  paper, we show that there are some specific voting games for which the problem is computationally tractable.
in particular, the problem of finding this value for the voting game is known to be #p-complete in the general case.
its main advantage is that it provides a unique and fair solution, but its main problem is that, for many coalition games, the shapley value cannot be determined in polynomial time.
the shapley value is one of the key solution concepts for  coalition games.
