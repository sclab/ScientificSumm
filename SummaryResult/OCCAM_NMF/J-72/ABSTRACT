in particular, we obtain an  algorithm that elicits xor bids with polynomial  communication.
our conversion procedure  allows us to generate combinatorial auction protocols from learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone dnf, and linear-threshold functions.
we also give conditions under which the resulting algorithms have polynomial communication.
the resulting elicitation  algorithms perform a polynomial number of queries.
we show that learning algorithms can be used as a basis for  preference elicitation algorithms.
we consider the parallels between the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and the problem of  learning an unknown function from learning theory.
