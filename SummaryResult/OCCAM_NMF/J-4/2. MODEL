the auctioneer may introduce a reserve score of r, so that an agent"s ad appears only if his score is at least r. for agent s, this translates into a reserve price (minimum bid) of r/ws. 
we assume throughout that agents are numbered such that agent s obtains position s. an agent pays per click the lowest bid necessary to retain his position, so that the agent in slot s pays ws+1 ws bs+1.
agents are ranked by score, so that the agent with highest score is ranked first, and so on.
if agent s bids bs, his corresponding score is wsbs.
a weight ws is associated with agent s, and agents bid for position.
bidders have  quasilinear utility, so that the utility to bidder s of obtaining position t at a price of p per click is esxt(vs − p).
bidder s has value vs for each click.
> xk > 0 and let xt = 0 for t > k. we also refer to es as the relevance of bidder s. it is useful to interpret xt as the probability that an ad in position t will be noticed, and es as the probability that it will be clicked on if noticed.
we assume that x1 > x2 > .
separable into an advertiser effect es ∈ [0, 1] and position effect xt ∈ [0, 1].
there are k positions to be allocated among n bidders, where n > k. we assume that the (expected) click-through rate of bidder s in position t is of the form esxt, i.e.
