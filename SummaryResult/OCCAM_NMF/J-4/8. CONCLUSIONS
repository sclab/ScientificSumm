it is unclear, though, whether such extensions help with more realistic distributions.
in the case of a uniform marginal distribution over values.
with this larger class the virtual score can equal the score, e.g.
for  instance, it is possible to introduce discounts ds and rank  according to wsbs âˆ’ ds; the equilibrium analysis generalizes to this case as well.
larger classes of ranking rules could be relevant.
if this problem could be solved, we could run simulations for nash equilibrium instead of symmetric equilibrium, to see if our insights are robust to the choice of solution concept.
there is as yet no efficient way to enumerate all possible nash allocations, so finding the minimum revenue is currently infeasible.
however, many  allocations can arise in nash equilibrium, and a linear program needs to be solved for each of these.
in principle the minimum revenue in nash equilibrium can be found by linear programming.
in this instance reserve pricing should be more competitive, but this is still an open question.
it would also be interesting to compare the effects of tuning q versus reserve pricing for keywords that have few bidders.
if it is, then simply using  rank-bybid where there is positive correlation, and rank-by-revenue where there is negative correlation, could be fine to a first  approximation and already improve revenue.
it would be interesting to do this analysis for a variety of  keywords, to see if the optimal setting of q is always so sensitive to the level of correlation.
there are several ways to push this research further.
we proposed that the auctioneer set bounds on the decrease in advertiser and user satisfaction he is willing to tolerate, which would imply bounds on the range of allowable q. with appropriate estimates for the distributions of value and  relevance, and knowledge of their correlation, the revenue curve can then be plotted within this range to locate the optimum.
on the other hand, we showed that advertiser  satisfaction and user experience could suffer if q is made too small.
in the simulations, the revenue improvements were greater than what could be obtained using reserve prices.
despite the simplicity of the rule change, simulations revealed that properly  tuning q can significantly improve revenue.
we also showed that, in principle, the same effect could be obtained by using bidding credits.
in practice, it should be very  simple to move between rules within the family: this simply  involves changing the exponent q applied to advertiser effects.
and google models as special cases.
in this work we looked into the revenue properties of a family of ranking rules that contains the yahoo!
