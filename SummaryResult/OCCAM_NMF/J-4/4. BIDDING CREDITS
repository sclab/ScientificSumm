for instance,  rankby-revenue will yield the same revenue as rank-by-bid if we set credits to cs = es. 
this technique allows one to use credits instead of explicit changes in the weights to affect revenue.
hence the equilibrium revenue will be as if we had used weights w rather than w. the bids will be scaled  versions of the bids that arise with weights w (and no credits), where each bid is scaled by the corresponding factor 1/cs.
if we define ws = ws cs and bs = csbs, we recover  inequality (3).
then in a symmetric equilibrium, we have esxs „ vs − ws+1 ws csbs+1 « ≥ esxt „ vs − wt+1 ws csbt+1 « or equivalently xs „ ws cs vs − ws+1bs+1 « ≥ xt „ ws cs vs − wt+1bt+1 « .
an indirect way to influence the allocation is to introduce bidding credits.3 suppose bidder s is only required to pay a fraction cs ∈ [0, 1] of the price he faces, or equivalently a (1 − cs) fraction of his clicks are received for free.
