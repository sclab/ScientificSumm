the appendix outlines the protocol. 
we have designed a failover protocols for buddycache but have not implemented it yet.
moreover, the failure of the redirector should allow unaffected clients to keep their caches intact.
the goal of the failover protocol is to reconfigure the buddycache in the case of a node failure, so that the failure of one node does not disrupt other clients from accessing shared objects.
a client group contains multiple client nodes and a  redi32 versionpageobject version vcache client cache client page cache figure 6: objecttoversion map with vcache rector that can fail independently.
