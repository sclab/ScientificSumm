the main contributions of the paper are: 1. extending cooperative caching techniques to support 37 fine-grain strong-consistency access in high-latency  environments, 2. an implementation of the system prototype that yields strong performance gains over the base system, 3. analytical and measurement based performance  evaluation of the costs and benefits of the new techniques capturing the dominant performance cost, high  network latency. 
for latencies ranging from 40 to 80 milliseconds round trip time, clients using the buddycache can reduce by up to 50% the latency of access to shared objects compared to the clients accessing the repository directly.
analytical results,  supported by the system measurements using the multi-user 007 benchmark indicate, that for typical internet latencies  buddycache provides significant performance benefits, e.g.
we have designed and implemented buddycache  prototype in thor distributed transactional object storage  system [23] and evaluated the benefits and costs of the system over a range of network latencies.
it  provides fine-grained validation using inexpensive coarse-grain version information.
solo commit, is a new validation technique that allows a client in a group to commit independently of slow or failed peers.
redirection,  however, can interfere with object availability.
buddycache uses redirection to fetch missing objects  directly from group members caches, and to support peer  update, a new lightweight application-level multicast  technique that gives group members consistent access to the new data committed within the collaborating group without  imposing extra overhead outside the group.
the technique improves performance yet provides strong correctness and availability properties in the presence of node failures and slow clients.
this paper described buddycache, a new transactional  cooperative caching [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] technique that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for  collaborative strong-consistency applications in high-latency  network environments.
these properties are difficult to provide in wide-area network  because of high network latency.
they require strong consistency for shared  persistent data and efficient access to fine-grained objects.
collaborative applications provide a shared work  environment for groups of networked clients collaborating on a  common task.
