in appoint, active clients of the  clientserver architecture act on the server"s behalf and  communicate with each other to decrease network latency, improve service bandwidth, and resolve server congestions.
this is a centralized peer-to-peer approach that helps internet users transfer large volumes of online data efficiently.
second, for prolonged periods of access to large online data, we  introduce appoint (an approach for peer-to-peer oï¬„oading the internet).
we enable the minimization of the requirements for system resources on the client side while maximizing system responsiveness as well as the number of connections one server can handle concurrently.
first, we introduce a client-server architecture where the work is distributed between the server and the  individual clients for spatial query evaluation, data visualization, and data management.
we propose two efficient approaches to remote access to large spatial data.
however, interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task.
enterprises in the public and private sectors have been  making their large spatial data archives available over the  internet.
