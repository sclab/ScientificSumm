this will also  convert the sand system from a research-oriented prototype into a product that could be used by end users for  accessing, viewing, and analyzing their data efficiently and with minimum effort. 
this will turn the sand system into a universal tool for accessing any spatial data set as it will be deployable on most platforms, work efficiently given large amounts of data, be able to tap any gml-enabled data source, and provide an easy to use graphical user interface.
we are currently working on making sand xml-compatible so that the user can  instantly retrieve spatial data provided by various agencies in the gml format via their web services and then explore, query, or process this data further within the sand  framework.
gml [4] is an xml variant that is becoming increasingly popular for exchange of geographical data.
the xml  protocol [3] has emerged to become virtually a standard for describing and communicating arbitrary data.
in order to access multiple data sources in real time, it is desirable to look for a mechanism that would support data exchange by design.
another issue is how to access data from different sources in different formats.
upon completion of this step of our work, we also plan to run comprehensive performance studies on our methods.
to address this, we will augment our methods to include efficient dynamic updates.
we assume that a peer (client) can become  unavailable at any anytime and hence provisions need to be in place to handle such a situation.
for the future, we envision development of new efficient  algorithms that will support large online data transfers within our peer-to-peer approach using multiple peers  simultaneously.
appoint forms an alternative  approach that improves performance under an existing  clientserver system by using idle client resources when individual users want work on a data set for longer periods of time using their client computers.
our client-server approach improves the system performance by using efficient caching methods when a remote server is  accessed from thin-clients.
we have outlined our approaches and introduced their individual elements.
an overview of our efforts in providing remote access to large spatial data has been given.
