section 2  describes our client-server approach in more detail.
the rest of this paper is organized as follows.
the results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our sand internet browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).
we call this architecture  appointapproach for peer-to-peer oï¬„oading the internet.
we have developed a centralized  peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the  distributed network resources among active clients of a  clientserver architecture.
the second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods.
the outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.
the low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.
we first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the  significant latency of the network connection on the other.
we focused our efforts in two directions.
power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.
however, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally.
in this case, the sand internet browser can still be utilized to view data from remote  locations.
the second option is to use a stand-alone sand internet browser along with a locally-installed internet-enabled database  management system (server piece).
this way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.
first, any standard web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (sand internet browser) as a java application or an applet.
there are two ways to deploy sand.
the system can start being utilized immediately  without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies.
in addition, since java has often been installed on target computers beforehand, our clients can be deployed on these systems with little or no need for any additional software installation or  customization.
sand internet browser is java-based, which makes it  deployable across many platforms.
users specify queries by  choosing the desired selection conditions from a variety of menus and dialog boxes.
the client-side sand internet browser provides a graphical user interface to the facilities of sand over the internet.
sand is a spatial database system developed at the  university of maryland [12].
the core functionality responsible for the actual database operations is performed by the server-based sand system.
we developed two separate methods for improving the system performance,  together, form a dynamic network infrastructure that is highly scalable and provides a satisfactory user experience for  interactions with large volumes of online spatial data.
unfortunately, interactive remote access to spatial data slows to a crawl without proper data access mechanisms.
users of this browser can interactively and visually manipulate spatial data remotely.
we have been  developing an interactive browser for accessing spatial online databases: the sand (spatial and non-spatial data)  internet browser.
interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task.
in recent years, enterprises in the public and private  sectors have provided access to large volumes of spatial data over the internet.
