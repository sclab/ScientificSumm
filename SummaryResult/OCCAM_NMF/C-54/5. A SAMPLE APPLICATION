in the latter case, the browser will use the  peerto-peer appoint architecture for first localizing the data. 
in the first case, for each action taken, the client-server architecture will decide what to ask for from the server.
with this example data, it is possible to work with the sand internet browser online as an applet (connecting to a remote server) or after localizing the data and then  opening it locally.
this ordering is shown by using different color shades.
the sites are obtained in an incremental manner with respect to a given point.
figure 3 illustrates the output of an example query that finds all arsenic sites within a given distance of the border of arkansas.
in order to avoid reporting a particular facility more than once, we use our ‘group by epa-id" mechanism.
(b) that participate in the air emissions program and are closer to it than to any other  eparegulated facility which has arsenic.
2. for each epa-regulated facility that has arsenic, find all epa-regulated facilities that have chlorine and: (a) that are closer to it than to any other  eparegulated facility that has arsenic.
(c) lie within 30 miles of the border of arkansas (i.e., both sides of the border).
(b) lie within arkansas or 30 miles within its border.
some queries that can be handled with our system on this data include: 1. find all epa-regulated facilities that have arsenic and participate in the air emissions program, and: (a) lie in georgia to illinois, alphabetically.
we put this data into a sand relation where the spatial attribute ‘location" corresponds to the latitude and  longitude.
for each file, we had the following information available: epa-id, name, street, city, state, zip code, latitude, longitude, followed by flags to  indicate if that facility is in the following epa programs:  hazardous waste, wastewater discharge, air emissions,  abandoned toxic waste dump, and active toxic release.
as an example, we looked at two data files corresponding to  environmental protection agency (epa)-regulated facilities that have chlorine and arsenic, respectively.
our goal is to provide more power to the users of fedstats by utilizing the sand internet browser.
we are using a fedstats data set as a testbed for our work.
fedstats [1] is an online source that enables ordinary  citizens access to official statistics of numerous federal agencies without knowing in advance which agency produced them.
