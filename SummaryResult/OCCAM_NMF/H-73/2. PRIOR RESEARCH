this strategy can save large amount of human judgment effort and is a big advantage of the unified utility maximization framework over the dtf especially when there are a large number of databases. 
the centralized sample database can serve as a bridge to connect the individual databases with the centralized logistic model, thus the probabilities of relevance of documents in different databases can be estimated.
in contrast, our approach only builds one logistic model for the centralized sample database.
this requires human relevance judgments for the results retrieved from each database.
second, the dtf builds a model for each database to calculate the probabilities of relevance.
first, the dtf is a framework designed specifically for document retrieval, but our new model integrates two distinct applications with different requirements (database recommendation and distributed document retrieval) into the same unified framework.
however, two points distinguish our research from the dtf model.
this framework computes a selection that minimizes the overall costs (e.g., retrieval quality, time) of document retrieval system and several methods [15] have been proposed to estimate the retrieval quality.
the research most similar to what we propose here is the decision-theoretic framework (dtf) [7,15].
the research in [21] tried to solve the problem with a heuristic method.
this type of inconsistency has been observed in previous research [4,21].
but as pointed out above, a good resource selection algorithm optimized for high-recall may not work well for document retrieval, which targets the high-precision goal.
in order to achieve accurate document retrieval results, many previous methods simply use resource selection algorithms that are effective of database recommendation system.
it serves as an important component of our unified utility maximization framework (section 3).
the ssl algorithm has been shown to be effective [22].
these linear models are used to convert the database-specific document scores into the approximated centralized document scores.
the semi supervised learning (ssl) [20,22] result merging algorithm uses the documents acquired by  querybased sampling as training data and linear regression to learn the database-specific, query-specific merging models.
the last step of the document retrieval sub-problem is results merging, which is the process of transforming database-specific 33 document scores into comparable database-independent document scores.
although the redde algorithm has been shown to be effective, it relies on heuristic constants that are set empirically [21].
the relevant document distribution estimation (redde [21]) resource selection algorithm is a recent algorithm that tries to estimate the distribution of relevant documents across the available databases and ranks the databases accordingly.
as prior research on different datasets has shown the cori algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [1,17,18], we use it as a baseline algorithm in this work.
the cori algorithm represents each database by its terms, the document frequencies and a small number of corpus statistics (details in [1]).
many resource selection algorithms such as ggloss/vgloss [8] and cori [1] have been proposed in the last decade.
experiments have shown that rather accurate resource descriptions can be built by sending about 80 queries and downloading about 300 documents [1].
as the sampled documents are selected by random queries, query-based sampling is not easily fooled by any adversarial spammer that is interested to attract more traffic.
thus, in uncooperative environments, one common choice is query-based sampling, which randomly generates and sends queries to individual search engines and retrieves some documents to build the descriptions.
furthermore, it is not easy to coordinate the databases to provide resource representations that are compatible with each other.
however, in uncooperative environments, even the databases are willing to share their information, it is not easy to judge whether the information they provide is accurate or not.
the starts protocol is one solution for acquiring resource descriptions in cooperative environments [8].
the first problem of distributed information retrieval is resource representation.
we survey the most related work in this section.
there has been considerable research on all the sub-problems of distributed information retrieval.
