acknowledgments this work benefited greatly from discussions with fang bian, hui zhang and other enl lab members, as well as from comments provided by the reviewers and our shepherd feng zhao. 
a third is  support for efficient resolution of existential queries-whether there exists an event matching a multi-dimensional range.
another direction is support for node heterogeneity in the zone construction process; nodes with larger storage space assert larger-sized zones for themselves.
unlike traditional database indices that re-balance trees upon data insertion, in sensor networks it might be feasible to re-structure the zones on a much larger timescale after obtaining a rough global estimate of the data  distribution.
one is adaptation to skewed data  distributions, since these can cause storage and transmission hotspots.
there are several interesting future directions that we intend to pursue.
we have a working prototype, both of gpsr and dim, and plan to conduct larger scale  experiments in the future.
our design of dims relies upon a novel locality-preserving hash inspired by early work in database indexing, and is built upon gpsr.
in this paper, we have discussed the design and evaluation of a distributed data structure called dim for efficiently  resolving multi-dimensional range queries in sensor networks.
