we believe this new generation of virtual conferencing environments will gain more popularity in the future as their ease of deployment is assured thanks to readily available technologies and scalable frameworks. 
we have implemented a cs application on a campus-wide network.
using sip standard for signaling makes this solution highly interoperable.
vad techniques help further traffic reduction.
this is due to the use of a conference server local to each domain.
the traffic in the wan (internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.
to ensure a satisfying performance, we do not demand the availability of multicast, but use it if and when available.
compatibility is assured thanks to the use of sip, the most  soughtafter signaling protocol.
these render impromptu speech in a virtual teleconference over voip a reality, as in a real face-to-face conference.
a mixed stream is played out at each client; each client may choose to have a customized mix since mixing is done at the local terminal of each client.
thus, there is significantly effective utilization of bandwidth.
additionally, we incorporate a result from a more recent work [15] where the sufficiency of three simultaneous speakers has been demonstrated.
interactivity is achieved by adapting a recent stream selection scheme based on loudness number.
we have argued that the distributed nature of deployment here makes it scalable.
in this paper, we have presented a discussion on a voice-only virtual conferencing environment.
