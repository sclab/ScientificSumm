we conclude taking alongside some implementation issues.

former visitor at cedt.
a discussion on swiss federal institute of technology, lausanne.
we address deployment issues.
section 6 comprises description of the various algorithms used in our setup.
in section 5, we explain the architecture of our system.
then we look into the motivations followed by relevant literature.
we first outline the challenges encountered in virtual audio conferences.
our focus is on virtual audio environments.
in this work, we do not discuss video conferencing; its inclusion does not significantly benefit conference quality [4].
regarding the functional aspect, we refer to [15] where it has been dealt with in some detail.
thus, the need is to take an approach that considers both aspects - the technical and the functional.
eckehard doerry [4] criticizes this approach by saying "it is keeping form before function".
this approach ignores the functional utility of the environment that is used for collaboration.
the basic approach is to provide larger bandwidth, more facilities and more advanced control mechanisms, looking forward to better quality of interaction.
there is plenty of discussion amongst hci and cscw community on the use of ethnomethodology for design of cscw applications.
while all the above requirements are from the technology point of view, the user's perspective and interactions are also essential factors.
additional critical issues are: (a) packet delay, (b) echo, (c) mixing of audio from selected clients, (d) automatic selection of clients to participate in the conference, (e) playout of mixed audio for every client, (f) handling clients not capable of mixing audio streams (such clients are known as dumb clients), and (g) deciding the number of simultaneously active clients in the conference without compromising voice quality.
clearly, the bandwidth required for a teleconference over the internet increases rapidly with the number of participants; reducing bandwidth without compromising audio quality is a challenge in internet telephony.
audio and video conferencing on internet are popular [25] for the several advantages they inhere [3,6].
among them, virtual conference (teleconference) facility is at the cutting edge.
further, we seek to port telephone services on the internet.
hence, as progressively time-sensitive voice and video applications are deployed on the internet, the inadequacy of the internet is exposed.
delay-constraints and characteristics separate traditional data on the one hand from voice & video applications on the other.
today's internet uses the ip protocol suite that was primarily designed for the transport of data and provides best effort data delivery.
