the above requirements are placed in the perspective of observations made in earlier works (vide sections 3 and 4) and will steer the vce design. 
• standardization: the solution must conform to established standards so as to gain interoperability and peer acceptance.
turn-taking in floor occupation by participants must be adapted gracefully to give a feel of natural transition.
• interactivity: in virtual conferencing environments (vces), we intend a face-to-face-like conferencing application that mimics a "real" conference, where more vocal participants invite attention.
so a means to regulate traffic to a minimum is needed for this kind of real-time applications.
traffic on wan should not grow appreciably with the total number of clients; else, this has lead to congestion.
• scalability: conferencing must seem uninterrupted under heavy loads, i.e., when many additional users are added on.
ease of use may include leveraging readily available, technically feasible and economically viable technologies.
application development should not presuppose specific characteristics of the underlying system or of network layers.
management (addition/removal) of clients and servers must be uncomplicated.
the following are of particular concern in the process: • ease of use: conferencing must be simple; users need no domain expertise.
conferencing many challenges arise in building a voip application.
