we have implemented a conference server (cs) application on a campus-wide network at our institute.
we deal with deployment issues of the proposed solution both in terms of scalability and interactivity, while explaining the techniques we use to reduce the traffic.
client selection is based on a recent quantifier called "loudness number" that helps mimic a physical face-to-face conference.
the framework is based on conference servers [14], which facilitate the audio handling, while we exploit the sip capabilities for signaling purposes.
the system is designed to accommodate a large number of end users speaking at the same time and spread across the internet.
in this paper, we describe an audio service framework designed to provide a virtual conferencing environment (vce).
for audio conferencing, we need to consider many issues - scalability, quality of the conference application, floor control and load on the clients/servers - to name a few.
recent trends favour services ported on packet-switched networks.
real-time services have been supported by and large on  circuitswitched networks.
