the actual messages are described in [16] and, as such, we do not present a complete description of them here. 
this is the reason it will be in the background of all controlling messages that will implicitly arise between the entities in our architecture.
sip, defined in [22] is now the most popular standard for voip deployment and has been chosen for its strength, ease of use, extensibility and compatibility.
the work presented here is in continuation of our studies into conferencing based on the session initiation protocol in [14] and [16].
an upper limit on the number of floors (i.e., the number of speakers allowed to speak at the same time) is fixed using a conjecture proposed in [15].
this permits a participant to freely get into the speaking mode to interrupt the current speaker as in a natural face-to-face meeting.
we make use of the "loudness number" for implementing floor control.
towards this goal, the voip conferencing system we propose is intended to be scalable and interactive.
thus there is a need to address conferencing as a whole with all its requirements considered concurrently.
evidently, different particular issues, all of which are a subset of requirements (defined in [14] and [16]) for a voip conferencing support, are tackled.
with multicasting, clients will have to parse many streams and traffic on a client"s network increases unnecessarily.
• for large conferences [23, 10] a centralized conference cannot scale up.
moreover, in [18], to allow impromptu speech, mixing is not done when the network can afford high bandwidth requirements for sending/receiving all the streams, but it is unnecessary [15].
• partial mixing [18] has a similar problem as that of mixing when more streams are mixed.
in this case, if applications are implemented with some control [5], the service becomes ‘gagging" for the users.
[24], assume only one participant is speaking at a time.
schulzrinne et al.
this way, the conference becomes markedly artificial and its quality degrades.
• floor control for an audio conference (even video conference) with explicit turn-taking instructions to participants renders the conference essentially a  one-speakerat-a-time affair, not a live and free-to-interrupt one.
• there cannot be many intermediate mixers (similarly, conference servers as in [10]) in stages as in [20] because it brings in inordinate delay by increasing the number of hops and is not scalable with interactivity in focus.
thus it is advisable to honour that constraint.
fixing the maximum number of simultaneous speakers is dealt in a recent work [15] using ethnomethodology, and is conjectured to be three.
there is a threshold on the number of simultaneous speakers above which increasing the number of speakers becomes counterproductive to conference quality.
customized mixing of streams is not possible when many clients are active.
this would lead to fluctuations in the volume of every individual participant causing severe degradation in quality.
the number of streams mixed varies dynamically depending on the number of active participants.
actually, mixing many arbitrary streams [24] from clients degrades the quality of the conference due to the reduction in the volume (spatial aspect of speech).
in all the above proposals, while there are some very useful suggestions, they share one or more of the following limitations: • in an audio conference, streams from all the clients need not be mixed.
a new approach called partial mixing by radenkovic [18] allows for mixed and non-mixed streams to coexist.
aspects of implementation for centralized sip conferencing are reported in [26].
the latest ietf draft by rosenberg and schulzrinne [23] discusses conferencing models with sip [22] in the background.
tightly coupled conference control protocols in internet belong to the itu-t h.323 family [9]; however, they are mainly for small conferences.
h. p. dommel [5] and many others highlight floor control as another pivotal aspect to be taken into account in designing a conferencing tool.
an overview of many issues involved in supporting a large conference is dealt in [8].
functional division and object-oriented architecture design that aid in implementation is presented in [1].
ramanathan and rangan [20] have studied in detail the architectural configurations comparing many conferencing architecture schemes taking into consideration the network delay and computation requirements for mixing.
