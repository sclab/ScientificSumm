we outline an initial solution incorporating these ideas and also show how our approach reduces network overhead by up to a  factor of 2.4 and results in up to 2.7 times faster information convergence than alternative approaches.
it (1) reduces protocol  overhead by limiting the amount of information exchanged  between participating nodes, (2) is resilient to network  alterations, due to node movement or node failures, and (3)  allows exponentially-fast information convergence.
we propose guess, a novel incremental gossiping approach to coordinated spectral sensing.
the inherent requirements of such data and the time-granularity at which it must be collected makes this problem both interesting and technically challenging.
we focus on the problem of sharing rf spectrum data among a collection of wireless devices.
such radios must coordinate with each other to build an accurate and consistent map of spectral  utilization in their surroundings.
wireless radios of the future will likely be frequency-agile, that is, supporting opportunistic and adaptive use of the rf spectrum.
