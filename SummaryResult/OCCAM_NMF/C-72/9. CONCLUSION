the fundamental contributions of guess are: (1) an fm aggregation scheme for efficient  innetwork aggregation, (2) a randomized gossiping approach which provides exponentially fast convergence and  robustness to network alterations, and (3) incremental variations of fm and gossip which we show can reduce the  communication time by up to a factor of 2.7 and reduce network overhead by up to a factor of 2.4. our preliminary  simulation results showcase the benefits of this approach and we also outline a set of open problems that make this a new and exciting area of research. 
we propose guess, an approximate yet low overhead approach to perform efficient coordination between cognitive radios.
the nature of the rf environment necessitates coordination between  cognitive radio devices.
spectrum sensing is a key requirement for dynamic  spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks.
