similar techniques can be used to implement standard gossip. 
this is different from the protocol discussed above where only  updated nodes initiate random walks.
each device would perform a coin toss (biased on the number of walks) to  determine whether or not it is a designated node.
random walk would operate by having devices periodically drop the aggregate and re-run the protocol.
for coordinated spectrum sensing, non-incremental  routing protocols can be implemented in a similar fashion.
nevertheless, the probability that gossip fails to converge is small, and has been shown to be o(1/n) [10].
due to the cumulative nature of fm, even if all devices have not converged, the next update will include all previous updates.
once all devices have entered the recovered state, the system will have converged, and with high probability, all devices will have the up-to-date average signal level.
at this point, it performs clean-up and prepares for the next infection by entering the susceptible state.
recovered: a recovered device ceases to propagate any update information.
as discussed in section 4.2, this happens after o(log(n)) time steps.
using this information, a device moves into the recovered state once enough time has passed for the most recent  update to have converged.

due to fm"s order and duplicate insensitive (odi) properties,  simultaneously occurring updates are handled seamlessly by the protocol.
infectious: once a device is infectious it continues to send its up-to-date bit vectors, using either incremental  random walk or incremental gossip, to neighboring nodes.
note, because signal level measurements may change  sporadically over time, a smoothing function, such as an  exponentially weighted moving average, should be applied to these measurements.
if it receives an update message, it ors the received original and delete bit vectors with its local bit vectors and moves into the infectious state.
if a local change is observed, the device updates either the original or delete bit vector, as described in section 5.1, and moves into the infectious state.
susceptible: each device starts in the susceptible state and becomes infectious only when its locally measured signal level changes, or if it receives an update message from a neighboring device.
figure 3 shows a state diagram of these phases.
using either incremental random walk or incremental  gossip, each device proceeds through three phases, in order to determine the global average signal level for a particular frequency band.
we continue with the example from section 5.1, where we wish to perform coordination between a group of wireless devices to compute the average signal level in a particular frequency band.
here we outline the  implementation of such techniques for a cognitive radio network.
using incremental routing protocols to disseminate  incremental fm aggregates is a natural fit for the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing.
