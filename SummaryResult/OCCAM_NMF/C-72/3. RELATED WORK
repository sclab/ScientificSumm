in  contrast, guess does not place such restrictions on secondary users, and can even function in highly mobile environments. 
although an improvement over purely centralized approaches, these  techniques still require a setup phase to generate the clusters, which not only adds additional delay, but also requires many of the secondary users to be static or quasi-static.
the corvus [4] architecture proposes a similar clustering method that can use either a centralized or decentralized approach to manage clusters.
cognitive radios organize into clusters and coordination  occurs within clusters.
[17] propose a distributed  coordination approach for spectrum sensing and allocation.
in other work, zhao et al.
however, due to the need of a fixed ap infrastructure, such a centralized approach is clearly not scalable.
aps direct mobile clients to collect such  sensing information on their behalf.
[11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which  sensing information is forwarded to aps for spectrum allocation purposes.

more recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.
this has motivated the need for cooperation among cognitive radios [16].
as a result, simple local  sensing approaches have not gained much momentum.
moreover, a shadowed secondary user may not even be able to detect signals from the primary.
sophisticated and costly hardware, beyond a simple energy detector, is  required to improve signal detection accuracy [16].
[16] to be extremely  difficult even if the modulation scheme is known.
this has been shown by sahai et al.
secondary users must be able to detect the  primary even if they cannot properly decode its signals.
detecting the presence of a primary user is non-trivial, especially a legacy primary user that is not cognitive  radio aware.
as mentioned earlier, the fcc has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].
research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [4, 17] over the years, and it is being projected as one of the leading enabling technologies for wireless networks of the future [9].
