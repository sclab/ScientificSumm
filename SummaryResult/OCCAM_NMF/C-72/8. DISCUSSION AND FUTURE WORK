the trade-offs of different approaches to implementing guess is a subject of future work. 
there are a variety of alternatives for  implementing such a channel, some of which are outlined in [4].
as well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing  information.
networking advertisement messages).
if  implemented at the mac layer, it may be feasible to piggy-back gossip messages over existing management frames (e.g.
implementation specifics: finally, implementing  gossip for coordinated spectrum sensing is also open.
determining how to assign such weights is an open area of research.
weighting their measurements more heavily could be used to maintain a higher degree of accuracy.
weighted readings: although we argued that most devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing  equipment, there may be situations where there are some special infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than others.
choosing an appropriate operating value for β is application dependent, and explored further in [3].
deciding if a change is significant can be done using a significance threshold β, below which any  observed change is not propagated by the node.
significance threshold: rf spectrum bands  continually experience small-scale changes which may not  necessarily be significant.
therefore, finding the optimal decay function is non-trivial, and an interesting subject of future work.
one challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.
spatially decaying  aggregates work by successively reducing (by means of a decay function) the value of the update as it propagates further from its origin.
therefore, we recommend the use of  spatially decaying aggregates [6], which limits the impact of an update on more distant nodes.
spatial decay: devices performing coordinated sensing are primarily interested in the spectrum usage of their local neighborhood.
next, we outline some open areas of research.
we have only just scratched the surface in addressing the problem of coordinated spectrum sensing using incremental gossiping.
