these incremental extensions can further reduce bandwidth requirements by up to a factor of 2.4 over the standard  approaches discussed above.

as we show in section 7, 1 convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment.
this is explained further in section 4. based on these insights, we propose guess, a low-overhead approach which uses incremental extensions to fm  aggregation and randomized gossiping for efficient coordination within a cognitive radio network.
by applying gossip and fm aggregation, aggregate bandwidth requirements drop to (c·logn time-steps × 50 devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 0.40 mbps, since 12 time-steps are needed to propagate the data (with c = 2, for illustrative purpoes1 ).
contrast this to the use of a randomized gossip protocol to disseminate such information, and the use of fm bit vectors to perform in-network aggregation.
exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require (50 time-steps × 50  devices × 700 bits per transmission) = 1.67 mbps of aggregate network bandwidth.
exchanging complete sensory information  between nodes would require 700 bits per transmission (for 100 channels, each requiring seven bits of information).
suppose we wish to compute the average signal energy in each of 100 discretized frequency bands, and each signal can have up to 128 discrete energy levels.
large sensory data: because cognitive radios can  potentially use any part of the rf spectrum, there will be  numerous channels that they need to scan.
coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such rf variations.
signal level can drop to a deep null with just a λ/4 movement in receiver position (3.7 cm at 2 ghz), where λ is the wavelength [14].
here, fading and multi-path interference  heavily impact sensing abilities.
this is especially true due to mobility, as rapid changes of the rf environment can occur due to device and obstacle movements.
short timescales: further compounding the problem is the need to immediately propagate updated rf sensory data, in order to allow devices to react to it in a timely  fashion.
thus, any such coordination must incur minimal network overhead.
therefore, any time spent  communicating sensory information takes away from the device"s ability to perform its intended function.
this implies that both data and sensory traffic will need to be time-multiplexed onto a single radio interface.
limited bandwidth: due to restrictions of cost and power, most devices will likely not have dedicated hardware for supporting coordination.
however, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.
[5] illustrate the gains from cooperation and show an order of magnitude reduction in the probability of interference with the primary user when only a small fraction of secondary users cooperate.
cabric et al.
coordinated sensing among secondary radios is essential due to limited device sensing resolution and physical rf  effects such as shadowing.
as a result, distributed spectrum sensing and allocation would become both important and fundamental.
therefore, it would be  reasonable to assume that a typical dense urban environment will contain several thousand cognitive radio devices in range of each other.
to estimate the scale of the problem, in-stat predicts that the number of wifi-enabled devices sold annually alone will grow to 430 million by 2009 [2].
