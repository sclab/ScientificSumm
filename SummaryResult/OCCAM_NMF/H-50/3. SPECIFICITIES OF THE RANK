the above-mentioned difficulties. 
in the ir context, rank aggregation methods need to  decide more or less explicitly which assumptions to retain w.r.t.
h4 new: candidate documents receive new positions in each input ranking, after discarding excluded ones.
regarding the positions of the  candidate documents, we can consider the following  working hypotheses: h4 init: the initial positions of candidate documents are kept in each input ranking.
4. when assumption h2 k holds, each input ranking may contain documents which will not be considered in the consensus ranking.
h3 no: no assumption is made, that is each missing  document is considered neither better nor worse than any other document.
we consider the following two working  hypotheses: h3 yes: each missing document in each j is assigned a position.
main reasons for a missing  document are that it was not indexed or it was indexed but deemed irrelevant ; usually this information is not available.
3. some candidate documents are missing documents in some input rankings.
we also call a candidate document which is missing in one or more rankings, a missing document.
hereafter, we call documents which will be retained in the consensus ranking, candidate documents, and documents that will be excluded from the consensus ranking, excluded documents.
h2 all: we consider all the documents which are ranked in at least one input ranking.
two working hypotheses are therefore considered: h2 k : we only consider documents which are present in at least k input rankings (k > 1).
2. since there are different documents in the input  rankings, we must decide which documents should be kept in the consensus ranking.
h1 all: we consider all the documents from each input ranking.
we thus consider the following two working hypotheses: h1 k : we only consider the top k best documents from each input ranking.
rank aggregation of partial lists raises four major  difficulties which we state hereafter, proposing for each of them various working assumptions: 1. partial lists can have various lengths, which can favour long lists.
[11], authors found that among the top 100 best documents of 7 input search engines, 67% of the documents were present in only one search engine, whereas less than two documents were present in all the search engines.
for instance, in the experiments carried out by dwork et al.
this was outlined in [14] as the problem of having to merge top-k results from various input lists.
3.2 partial lists in real world applications, such as metasearch engines, rankings provided by the input methods are often partial lists.
• assuming that document di is better ranked than  document di in a ranking j, di is more likely to be  definitively more relevant than di in j when the number of intermediate positions between di and di increases.
thus a slight perturbation of the initial ranking is meaningless.
it is therefore important to build the consensus ranking based on robust information: • documents with near positions in j are more likely to have similar interest or relevance.
this was outlined in [13] as the problem of aggregation with ties.
in this case, we call such rankings semi orders.
indeed, in the ir context, the complete order provided by an input method may hide ties.
for instance, having three relevant documents in the first three positions, any perturbation of these three items will have the same value.
aggregation problem in the ir context 3.1 limited significance of the rankings the exact positions of documents in one input ranking have limited significance and should not be overemphasized.
