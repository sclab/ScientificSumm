by contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion urls. 
[4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from google, and a  neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from google.
a more recent study by borodin et al.
[1] employed  quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.
amento et al.
we are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of hits and of pagerank.
given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of pagerank and hits, and the thorough  studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their  effectiveness have been published.
[2]  studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of pagerank scores, and langville and meyer examined basic properties of pagerank such as  existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].
[3] investigated various theoretical  properties of pagerank, hits, salsa, and phits, including their similarity and stability, while bianchini et al.
for  example, borodin et al.
another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of hits and pagerank.
query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by pagerank include trafficrank [22], blockrank [14], and trustrank [11], and many others.
query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by hits include salsa [19], randomized hits [20], and phits [7], to name a few.
there are numerous attempts at improving the  effectiveness of hits and pagerank.
the popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the google search engine, which uses pagerank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.
the idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the hits [16, 17] and pagerank [5, 21] algorithms.
