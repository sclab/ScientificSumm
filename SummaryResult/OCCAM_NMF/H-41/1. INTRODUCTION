section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and section 8 offers concluding remarks. 
sections 5 and 6 describe the pagerank and hits algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments.
section 4 reviews the  performance measures we used.
section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.
the remainder of this paper is structured as follows:  section 2 surveys related work.
this  continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.
however, we were quite surprised to find that hits, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most  simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.
this is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these  measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.
our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.
to our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to  evaluate hits at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.
relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.
however,  computing hits efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.
if we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions won"t carry over to large graphs such as the web.
scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.
there are two main difficulties: scale and  relevance.
comparing hits to pagerank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.
this, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.
the text of incoming links.
this is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the document"s anchor text, i.e.
however, it remains unclear today whether there are  practical benefits of hits over other link graph measures.
the hits algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect hits to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.
link graph features such as in-degree and pagerank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.
