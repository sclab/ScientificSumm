some scenarios were described to illustrate our proposal and they seem to be a promising way to improve the process of building reputation just using existing technologies. 
the art testbed has been enriched to use the ontology during agent transactions.
a reputation mapping module allows agents to translate information from their internal reputation model into the shared model and vice versa.
in this paper we present a proposal for reducing the incompatibility between reputation models by using a general agent architecture for reputation interaction which relies on a functional ontology of reputation (fore), used as a globally shared reputation model.
