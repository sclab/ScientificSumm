categories and subject descriptors i.2.11 [distributed artificial intelligence]: multiagent systems general terms design, experimentation, standardization. 
this data is used during interaction among heterogeneous agents when exchanging reputation values and may be used for agents that use different reputation models.
we experiment this idea by enhancing the art reputation model with semantic data obtained from this ontology.
in this paper we propose the use of an ontology to deal with this issue.
the heterogeneity of its components turns the establishment of interaction or cooperation among them into a non trivial task, since agents may use different internal models and the decision about trust other agents is a crucial condition to the formation of agents' cooperation.
in open mas it is often a problem to achieve agents' interoperability.
