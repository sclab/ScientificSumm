more details about the fore can be found on [2][3]. 
primaryreputation is composed of concepts observedreputation and directreputation and the concept secondaryreputation is composed of concepts such as propagatedreputation and collectivereputation.
the ontology defines the concept reputationtype which can be primaryreputation or secondaryreputation.

these concepts do not exist in the typology of reputation or in the regret model.
for instance, image and reputation are two central concepts in the cognitive reputation model.
