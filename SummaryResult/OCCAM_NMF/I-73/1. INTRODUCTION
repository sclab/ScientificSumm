an outline of this approach is sketched in the context of a testbed for the experimentation and comparison of trust models, the art testbed [6]. 
this paper describes how the fore can be applied to allow interoperability among agents that have different reputation models.
casare and sichman [2][3] proposed a functional ontology of reputation (fore) and some directions about how it could be used to allow the interoperability among different agent reputation models.
reputation is a subject that has been studied in several works [4][5][8][9] with different approaches, but also with different semantics attached to the reputation concept.
the trust decision processes use the concept of reputation as the basis of a decision.
such trust decision is very important because it is an essential condition to the formation of agents' cooperation.
solutions to this problem have been proposed by the way of trust models where agents are endowed with a model of other agents that allows them to decide if they can or cannot trust another agent.
these features are interesting to obtain flexible and adaptive systems but they also create new risks about the reliability and the robustness of the system.
since agents are considered as autonomous entities, we cannot assume that there is a way to control their internal behavior.
open multiagent systems (mas) are composed of autonomous distributed agents that may enter and leave the agent society at their will because open systems have no centralized control over the development of its parts [1].
