since propagatedreputation is a sub-concept of secondaryreputation, it can be inferred that witness reputation is also mapped to secondaryreputation. 
nevertheless, the concepts direct trust and witness reputation from the regret system reputation model are mapped to primaryreputation and propagatedreputation from fore.
also, a mapping between the typology of reputation and the fore relates the concepts direct reputation and indirect reputation to primaryreputation and secondaryreputation from fore, respectively.
for instance, a mapping between the cognitive reputation model ontology and the fore relates the concepts image and reputation to primaryreputation and secondaryreputation from fore, respectively.
also, the information concerning the mappings between the agent reputation models and the fore can be directly inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the integration of a given reputation model ontology and the fore in an ontology tool with reasoning engine.
therefore, considering the ontologies which describe the agent reputation models we can define a mapping between these ontologies and the fore whenever the ontologies use a common vocabulary.
casare and sichman [3] used the hybrid approach to show that the fore serves as a common ontology for several reputation models.
this latter organizes the common global vocabulary in order to support the source ontologies comparison.
models to the fore visser et al [12] suggest three different ways to support semantic integration of different sources of information: a centralized approach, where each source of information is related to one common domain ontology; a decentralized approach, where every source of information is related to its own ontology; and a hybrid approach, where every source of information has its own ontology and the vocabulary of these ontologies are related to a common ontology.
