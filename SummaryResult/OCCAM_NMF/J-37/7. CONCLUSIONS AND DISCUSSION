that game tree size has required us to use the approximation version of gameshrink (as well as round-based abstraction) [16, 15].
we are currently working on using these techniques for full-scale 2-player limit texas hold"em poker, a highly popular card game whose game tree has about 1018 nodes.
the method also yields bounds on the suboptimality of the resulting strategies.
we also discussed how (in a two-player zero-sum game), linear programming can be used in an anytime manner to generate approximately  optimal strategies of increasing quality.
to further improve scalability, we introduced an  approximation variant of gameshrink, which can be used as an anytime algorithm by varying a parameter that controls the coarseness of abstraction.
using gameshrink, we found a minimax equilibrium to rhode island hold"em, a poker game with 3.1 billion nodes in the game tree-over four orders of magnitude more than in the largest poker game solved previously.
168 the size of the game tree.
such (non-game-theoretic) techniques are unlikely to be competitive in poker because of the greater importance of information hiding and bluffing.
there are also other bridge programs that use search techniques for perfect information games in  conjunction with statistical sampling and expert-defined  abstraction [48].
instead, partition search is used in  conjunction with statistical sampling to simulate the uncertainty in bridge.
it is no larger than the game tree, and on nontrivial games it is drastically smaller, so gameshrink has time and space complexity sublinear in 8 bridge is also a game of imperfect information, and partition search does not find the equilibrium for that game either.
the complexity of gameshrink is Ëœo(n2 ), where n is the number of nodes in the signal tree.
we proved that in games with ordered signals, any nash  equilibrium in the smaller abstracted game maps directly to a nash equilibrium in the original game.
we introduced the ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation and gave an algorithm, gameshrink, for  abstracting the game using the isomorphism exhaustively.
