we are interested in further exploring better approximation  algorithms for pair betting markets. 
interesting open questions for our permutation betting  include the computational complexity of optimal indivisible matching for subset betting and the necessary condition for the existence of a match in pair betting markets.
a natural greedy algorithm has been shown to give poor approximation for indivisible pair betting.
we identify a sufficient condition for the existence of a match, which can be verified in polynomial time.
we prove that the optimal matching problem for the auctioneer is np-hard for pair betting with both indivisible and divisible orders via reductions to the minimum feedback arc set problem.
the complexity changes dramatically for pair betting.
we find that in a subset betting  market an auctioneer can find the optimal set and quantity of orders to accept such that his worst-case profit is maximized in polynomial time if orders are divisible.
we examine the auctioneer problem of matching orders without incurring risk.
pair betting allows traders bet on whether one given  candidate ranks higher than another given candidate.
in a subset betting market, traders can bet either on a subset of positions that a candidate stands or on a subset of  candidates who occupy a specific position in the final ordering.
different final orderings, we propose two expressive betting languages, subset betting and pair betting.
while it is  unnatural and intractable to allow traders to bet directly on the n!
we consider a permutation betting scenario, where traders wager on the final ordering of n candidates.
