finally, the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual node, we plan to design a distributed index. 
in addition, we plan to integrate a revision control system into the content distribution portion of apocrita so that users could have the ability to update an existing file that they found and have the old revision maintained and the new revision propagated.
for future work, apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.
despite these shortcomings, the experience gained from the design and implementation of apocrita has given us more insight into building challenging distributed systems.
a proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.
it eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared among users while being edited and reduce the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed.
it can help organizations with no network file server or necessary network infrastructure to share documents.
we presented apocrita, a distributed p2p searching and indexing system intended for network users on an intranet.
