a proof of concept prototype is presented in section 5, and performance evaluations are discussed in section 6. related work is presented is section 7, and finally conclusions and future work are discussed in section 8. 
the distributed indexing mechanism and protocol are presented in section 3. section 4 presents the  peer-topeer distribution model.
in section 2, we present apocrita.
the rest of this paper is organized as follows.
in this paper we present apocrita, which is a cost-effective distributed p2p file sharing system for such organizations.
furthermore, some organizations do not have a file sharing server or the necessary network infrastructure to enable one.
the user may be required to search for a particular document, which some search tools such as google desktop may be a solution for local documents but will not find a document on another user"s machine.
there may even be multiple different documents in the process of being edited.
this can easily cause incorrect version to be sent or conflicts created between multiple users trying to make amendments to a document.
in some cases these documents are sent between authors, via email, to be edited.
this access may be needed for editing or simply viewing a document.
many organizations are required to author documents for various purposes, and such documents may need to be accessible by all members of the organization.
we strive to make the process of sharing documents within an intranet easier.
the user still needs to put the files in the proper directory, manage files with multiple versions, delete the files when they are no longer wanted.
the downloaded files still require a lot of manual management by the user.
while the utilization of p2p clients is already a gigantic step forward compared to downloading files off websites, using such programs are not without their problems.
these programs enable millions of users to share files among themselves.
there are already programs on the market that enable p2p file sharing.
with the increasingly common place broadband internet access, p2p technology has finally become a viable way to share documents and media files.
the peer-to-peer (p2p) computing paradigm is becoming a completely new form of mutual resource sharing over the internet.
