local and remote files should be easily accessible through a virtual mountable file system, providing transparency for users. 
to decrease the time required for indexing a large number of documents, the indexing process is distributed across available idle nodes.
it is operating system independent, and easy to access through a web browser or through a standalone application.
the system also provides some redundancy and in the event of a single machine failure, no important documents will be lost.
it eliminates the need for documents to be manually shared between users while being edited and reduces the possibility of conflicting versions being distributed.
the main focus is organizations that may not have a network large enough to require a file server and supporting infrastructure.
apocrita is intended for network users on an intranet.
apocrita supports a decentralized network model where the peers use a discovery protocol to determine peers.
the distributed nature of the documents is transparent to the user.
it provides a simple interface for searching and accessing files that may exist either locally or remotely.
for example, if a machine contains an important document and the machine is currently inaccessible, the system is capable of maintaining availability of the document through this distribution mechanism.
174 will also distribute documents across multiple machines to ensure high availability of important documents.

second, apocrita provides a method of reverting to previous document versions.
first, due to the inherent nature of apocrita, the document will only reside on a single logical location.
apocrita solves this problem using two approaches.
this means there must be a manual process to maintain document versions.
it is even possible that different revisions could reside on each node on the intranet.
currently, it is possible for documents to be located on a user's machine or on a remote machine.
apocrita is a distributed peer-to-peer file sharing system, and has been designed to make finding documents easier in an intranet environment.
