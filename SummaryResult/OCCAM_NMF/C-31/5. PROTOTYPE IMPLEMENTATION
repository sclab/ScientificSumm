in order to facilitate this transfer efficiently, index transfer will use an unsecured propagated pipe to communicate with all nodes in the apocrita network. 
in the case of index transfer, a socket must be created between all nodes in the network in order to pass the index, which allows for all nodes to have a full and complete index of the entire network.
in the case of file transfer, a socket is created between only two nodes.
however, there is one key difference between file transfer and index transfer.
in fact, the index transfer actually passes the index as a file.
index transfer works exactly like a file transfer.
file passing is also used within apocrita for index transfer.
file passing uses an unsecured unicast pipe in order to transfer data.
a jxta socket is similar to a standard java socket, however a jxta socket uses jxta pipes in underlying network transport.
after a file has been searched for and located within the peer group, a jxta socket will be opened and file transfer will take place.
file passing is used within apocrita for file transfer.
idle nodes will reply with a status message to indicate they are available to start indexing.
for example, a node attempting to find an idle node to participate in indexing will query nodes via the message facility.
message passing is used to pass status messages between nodes in order to aid in indexing, searching, and retrieval.
this includes an unsecured unicast pipe, a secured unicast pipe, and a propagated unsecured pipe.
the pipe facility provides many different types of pipe advertisements.
it uses the pipe facility in order to pass messages and files between nodes.
by using jxta, apocrita takes advantage of a reliable, and proven peer-to-peer transport mechanism.
jxta is used to pass both messages and files between nodes in the search network.
apocrita uses the jxta framework [5] as a peer-to-peer transport library between nodes.
in the current implementation, apocrita is only capable of indexing plain text documents.
apache lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in java.
apocrita uses the lucene framework [7], which is a project under development by the apache software foundation.
