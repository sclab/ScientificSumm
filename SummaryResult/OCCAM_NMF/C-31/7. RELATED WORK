yacy however, is designed as a web search engine and, as such solves a much different problem than apocrita. 
apocrita will also use a distributed index in future implementations and may benefit from using an implementation of a dht.
yacy used many peers and dht to maintain a distributed index.
the local node is used to query but all results that are returned are accessible on the internet.
it used a distributed hash table (dht) to maintain the index.
yacy is designed to maintain a distributed index of the internet.
yacy consists of a web crawler, an indexer, a built-in database engine, and a p2p index exchange protocol.
yacy [6] is a peer-to-peer web search application.
the distributed indexing aspect of this project most closely relates apocrita goals.
the index itself is not distributed, only the act of indexing is distributed.
a central area for querying the index is available on the majestic-12 web page.
each user would install a client, which is responsible for indexing a portion of the web.
for example, majestic-12 [4] is a distributed search and indexing project designed for searching the internet.
however, apocrita also has unique novel searching and indexing features that make this system unique.
several decentralized p2p systems [1, 2, 3] exist today that apocrita features some of their functionality.
