it also provides a nice tradeoff between physical cost (anchors) and soft cost (events), while maintaining localization accuracy.
this  evaluation demonstrates that msp can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on  sensor nodes nor precise event distribution.
we have evaluated the msp system through theoretical analysis, extensive simulation as well as two physical systems (an indoor version with 46 micaz motes and an outdoor version with 20 micaz motes).
we address several interesting issues, such as  incomplete (partial) node sequences and sequence flip, found in the mirage test-bed we built.
starting from a basic msp design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy.
the novel idea behind msp is to  reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences, easily obtained through loosely guided event  distribution.
to overcome limitations in  existing solutions, we present a multi-sequence positioning (msp) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments.
most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and  effective range of sensor devices.
wireless sensor networks have been proposed for use in many location-dependent applications.
