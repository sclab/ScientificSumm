results demonstrate that requiring neither costly  hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution, msp can achieve a sub-foot accuracy with very few anchor nodes  provided sufficient events.
we also evaluated  performance at scale through analysis as well as extensive  simulations.
the practical issues of partial node sequence and sequence flip were identified and addressed in two physical system test-beds.
importantly, these optimization methods can be used together, and improve accuracy additively.
we  proposed four novel optimization methods, exploiting order and marginal distribution among non-anchor nodes as well as the feedback information from early localization results.
we demonstrated that we could significantly improve localization accuracy by making full use of the information embedded in multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences.
in this paper, we present the first work that exploits the  concept of node sequence processing to localize sensor nodes.
