these two techniques may be combined. 
our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query  expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use user"s implicit feedback information to expand the current query.
ucair first judges whether two neighboring queries  belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.
ucair makes direct use of a user"s query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.
there have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].
second, both the computation of  personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].
first, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].
there are two remarkable advantages on this.
furthermore, the personalization of ucair is provided on the client side.
in contrast, ucair personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.
search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they  dislike.
currently some search engines provide rudimentary  personalization, such as google personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from  predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and my yahoo!
(4) we develop and evaluate a  personalized web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.
(3) we propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval  process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval  models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22].
(2) we perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback  information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits  longterm implicit feedback [10].
implicit user modeling for personalized search has been  studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) we emphasize the exploitation of  immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback  information [25].
