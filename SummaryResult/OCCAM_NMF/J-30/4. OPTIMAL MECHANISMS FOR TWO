in other words, for n > 2 players, the number of monotone and non-degenerate mechanisms becomes exponential in n. proposition 3. the number of monotone non-  degenerate k-action mechanisms in an n-player game is exponential in n, even if |a| = 2. 
the hardness stems from the fact that the necessary conditions we specified before for the optimality of the mechanisms (i.e., non-degenrate and monotone  allocations) are not restrictive enough for the general model.
we do not know how to give an exact characterization of the optimal mechanisms in multi-player and multi-alternati ve environments.
examples in which this condition holds are the public good model presented in section 5 and auctions [5].
similarly, if the players" preferences are conflicting (e.g., a 1 b and b 2 a), then the optimal alternative must be the same under the profiles (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2).
optimal mechanism will be non-degenerate with respect to both players: if the players" preferences are correlated (e.g., a 1 b and a 2 b), then the optimal alternative must be the same under the profiles (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2).
the rightmost table show an example for a diagonal allocation scheme where one of the player has only k − 1 possible actions.
however, the proof identifies the following sufficient condition under which the 68 0 1 2 3 0 a a a b 1 a a b b 2 a b b b 3 b b b b 0 1 2 3 0 a a a a 1 a a a b 2 a a b b 3 a b b b 0 1 2 3 0 b b b b 1 a b b b 2 a a b b 3 a a a b 0 1 2 3 0 a a a b 1 a a b b 2 a b b b figure 1: the three left tables show all possible diagonal allocation scheme with 4 possible actions for each player.
a corollary from the proof of theorem 1 is that the optimal 2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the players has only k − 1 different actions).
theorem 3. in environments with two alternatives and two players, if the social-value function is multilinear and single crossing, then the optimal k-action mechanism is  diagonal, and the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies that are mutually maximizers.
therefore, the  original mechanism was not the optimal k-action mechanism.
we then show that we can insert a new missing column, and an appropriately chosen threshold, and strictly increase the expected social value in the mechanism.
these two columns can be unified to a single action, and the  mechanism can therefore be described as a k × k − 1 matrix.
if the player, w.l.o.g., the columns player, is degenerate, then there are two columns with an identical allocation.
in the proof, we start with a k × k allocation matrix, and show that the mechanism cannot be degenerate with respect to one of the players (we show how to choose this player).
it turns out that in 2-player, 2-alternative environments, where the social-choice rule is multilinear and single  crossing, the optimal expected social value is achieved in  diagonal mechanisms with mutually-maximizer strategies.
the threshold vectors x, y are called mutually maximizers if all their thresholds are maximizers (except the first and the last).
player 1) is a maximizer if eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, a) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) = eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, b) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) where j is the action of player 2 for which the mechanism swaps the chosen alternative exactly when player 1 plays i, i.e., t(i, j) = t(i − 1, j) (we denote, w.l.o.g., t(i, j) = a, t(i − 1, j) = b).
definition 13. consider a monotone 2-player  mechanism g that is non-degenerate with respect to the two  players, where the players use threshold strategies based on the threshold vectors x, y. we say that the threshold xi of one player (w.l.o.g.
for  optimizing the expected social value, this type for player 2 should clearly be the type for which the expected social value from a equals the expected social value from b (given that player 1 plays i); for greater values of player 2, the single-crossing condition ensures that b will be preferred.
that is, the alternative a will be chosen for low actions of player 2, and the alternative b will be chosen for higher actions of player 2. by determining a threshold for player 2, the social planner actually determines the minimal type of player 2 from which the alternative b will be chosen.
the reason why mutually-maximizer strategies maximize the expected social value in monotone mechanisms is intuitive: consider some action i (row in the matrix representation) for player 1. in a monotone mechanism, the allocation in such a row will be of the form [a, a, ..., b, b] (assuming that b 2 a).
we define the notion of  mutuallymaximizer thresholds, and show that threshold strategies based on such thresholds are optimal.
to complete the description of the optimal allocation scheme, we now move to determine the optimal strategies in diagonal mechanisms.
in both cases, the optimal mechanism can also take the form of one of the possibilities described, except one of the players is not allowed to choose the fixed allocation action.
t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 > b2.
t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 ≥ b2 (b).
t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 + b2 ≥ k. 2. if the two players have conflicting preferences (e.g., a 1 b and b 2 a) then either (a).
t(b1, b2) = b iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1 (b).
proposition 2. any diagonal 2-player mechanism has one of the following forms: 1. if both players favor the same alternative (w.l.o.g., b i a for i = 1, 2) then either (a).
interestingly, one of these forms is degenerate with respect to one of the players; that is, it can be described as a mechanism with k − 1 actions for this player.
simple combinatorial  considerations show that diagonal mechanisms may come in very few forms.
the term diagonal originates from the matrix  representation of these mechanisms, in which one of the diagonals determines the boundary between the choice of the two  alternatives (see figure 1).
definition 12. a 2-player 2-alternative mechanism with k-possible actions is called diagonal if it is monotone, and non-degenerate with respect to at least one of the players.
for example, a 2-player mechanism is degenerate with  respect to the rows player, if there are two rows with  identical allocation in the matrix representation of the game.
definition 11. a mechanism is degenerate with respect to player i if there exist two actions bi, bi for player i such that for all profiles b−i of actions of the other players, the allocation scheme is identical whether player i reports bi or bi (i.e., ∀b−i, t(bi, b−i) = t(bi, b−i)).
using this propery, we then define diagonal mechanisms that turns out to exactly characterize the set of optimal mechanisms.
intuitively, a degenrate mechanism does not utilize all the action space it is allowed to use, and therefore it cannot be optimal.
in a degenerate mechanism, there are two actions for one of the players that are identical in their allocation.
a key notion in our characterization of the optimal  actionbounded mechanism, is the notion of non-degenerate  mechanisms.
we find this  description, which does not explicitly mention the payments, easier for the presentation.
it is well known that in monotone mechanisms for one dimensional environments, the allocation scheme uniquely defines the payments in the dominant-strategy implementation.
doing this, we completely describe which alternative is chosen for every profile of types of the players.
note that in this section, as in most parts of this paper, we characterize monotone mechanisms by their allocation scheme and by a profile of strategies for the players.
players and two alternatives in this section, we present a full characterization of the optimal mechanisms in action-bounded environments with two players and two alternatives, where the social-choice functions are multilinear and single crossing.
