this prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 
the only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be  incorporated into the expert finding task.
both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).
our task, then, is to  estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.
where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).
we state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: what is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidate"s (expertise) profile?
in this paper we only address the problem of  determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.
are all part of the candidate"s social profile, and can serve as a background against which the system"s recommendations should be interpreted.
collaborators, and affiliations, etc.
who is her superior?
what is her role in the organization?
is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?
what are her contact details?
examples of such context are: who does she work with?
(3) 1 context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise  finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.
, s(ca, kn) .
, kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), .
thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, .
each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to  define the candidate"s topical profile.
a topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate ca"s  expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).
by focusing on  automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .
however, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating,  maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.
generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of  tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.
this is the candidate"s topical profile.
the profiling of an individual candidate involves the  identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.
essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.
3.2 expert profiling while the task of expert searching was concerned with  finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: what topics does a candidate know about?
whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be  uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20].
p(ca|q) ‚àù p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) in this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability  captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.
thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert.
since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.
since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the  expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking bayes" theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the  probability of a query.
the challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.
the candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.
that is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.
we can state this  problem as follows: what is the probability of a candidate ca being an  expert given the query topic q?
within an organization there are usually many possible  candidates who could be experts for given topic.
or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.
e.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a  particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).
3.1 expert finding expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: who are the experts on topic x?.
by using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the  vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing).
in order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.
to feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.
in the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).
