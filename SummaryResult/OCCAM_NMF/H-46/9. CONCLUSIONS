future work includes setting up manual assessments of  automatically generated profiles by the employees themselves, especially in cases where the employees have not provided a profile themselves. 
we found that current models of expertise retrieval generalize well to this new environment; in addition we found that refining the models to account for the differences results in significant improvements, thus making up for problems caused by data sparseness issues.
we evaluated how current state-of-the-art models for expert  finding and profiling performed in this new setting and then refined these models in order to try and exploit the different  characteristics within the data environment (language, topicality, and  organizational structure).
the new collection reflects the typical properties of knowledge-intensive institutes noted above and also includes several features which may are potentially useful for expertise retrieval, such as topical and organizational structure.
to examine expertise retrieval in this setting, we introduced (and released) the uvt expert collection as a representative case of such knowledge intensive organizations.
typically, the amount of available data in such an organization (e.g., a university, a research institute, or a research lab) is limited when compared to the w3c collection that has mostly been used for the experimental evaluation of expertise retrieval so far.
in this paper we focused on expertise retrieval (expert finding and profiling) in a new setting of a typical knowledge-intensive  organization in which the available data is of high quality,  multilingual, and covering a broad range of expertise area.
