in section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then  assessed in section 6 using the uvt data set that we introduce in  section 5. advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in section 7 and evaluated in section 8. we formulate our conclusions in section 9. 
then, in section 3 we provide  detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.
in the next section we review related work.
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
finally, we demonstrate that the  organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving map scores for certain models by up to 70%.
the best performing similarity  measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the w3c (and other) settings as well.
taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly  improve retrieval performance.
we find that profiling on the uvt data set is considerably more  difficult than on the w3c set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the uvt set, versus 50 in the w3c case.
while on the w3c setting the expert finding task appears to be more  difficult than profiling, for the uvt data the opposite is the case.
the baseline models  developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.
apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.
a second group of  experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the uvt expert collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling  methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure.
the first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting.
using the uvt expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.
this type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and  focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual  (english and dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves.
our  collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the  website of tilburg university (uvt).
for our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the uvt expert collection) which is  representative of the type of intranet that we described above.
this allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the  relations between the two tasks.
to answer our research questions, we first present a set of  baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding associations between topics and people.
in addition to, how can the topical and  organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes?
how does the inclusion or exclusion of different documents affect  expertise retrieval tasks?
more generally, do the lessons from the expert finding task at trec carry over to this setting?
how do state-of-the-art algorithms developed on the w3c data set perform in the alternative scenario of the type described above?
we focus on a number of research questions in this paper: does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms?
this setting is quite different from the w3c setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.
typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical  structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization),  organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).
in this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the w3c setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of  universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations.
with only one test collection it is not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings.
while this collection is currently the only publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only represents one type of intranet.
however, nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has been validated experimentally using the w3c collection [24] from the enterprise track.
the launch of the expert finding task at trec has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects.
an alternative task, which using the same idea of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3].
this task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be  evidence of expertise.
the goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.
at the trec enterprise track [22] the need to study and  understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the  introduction of expert finding tasks.
to efficiently and effectively achieve this, it is necessary to provide search facilities that enable employees not only to access documents, but also to identify expert colleagues.
an organization"s intranet provides a means for exchanging  information between employees and for facilitating employee  collaborations.
