h.5.3 [information interfaces and presentation]: group and organization interfaces - asynchronous interaction, collaborative computing, theory and models, synchronous interaction.
h.1.2 [models and principles]: user/machine systems - human factors.
categories and subject descriptors c.2.4 [computer-communication networks]: distributed systems - distributed applications.
we then present the architecture of our system, which consists of two parts: a subsystem for location sensing that acquires information about the location of users as well as spatial proximities between them, and one for the actual context-aware application, which provides services for group interaction.
first, an introduction to context computing and a motivation for using contextual information to facilitate group interaction is given.
in this paper, we present an implemented system for supporting group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments.
