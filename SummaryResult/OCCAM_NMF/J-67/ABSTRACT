we then show a matching lower bound for deterministic mechanisms that never pay the agents.
for the resulting mechanism design problem (in which we also slightly strengthen an assumption from the non-strategic setting), we present a mechanism that  addresses each incentive issue, while only increasing the  competitive ratio by one.
the agent can then delay releasing the job to the algorithm, inflate its length, and  declare an arbitrary value and deadline for the job, while the center determines not only the schedule, but the payment of each agent.
motivated by emerging areas such as grid computing, we instead consider this  problem in an economic setting, in which each job is released to a separate, self-interested agent.
however, these results only apply to the non-strategic setting in which the jobs are  released directly to the algorithm.
for the problem of online real-time scheduling of jobs on a single processor, previous work presents matching upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio that can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm.
