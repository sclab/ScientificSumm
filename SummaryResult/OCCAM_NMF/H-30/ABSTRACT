we also  describe how our technique can be used to generate  meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query  suggestion/reformulation.
our model  demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several trec data sets.
we evaluate our  technique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique.
furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond  simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques.
the technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during  expansion.
in this paper, we propose a robust query expansion technique based on the markov random field model for information retrieval.
most previous approaches have ignored important issues, such as the role of features and the importance of modeling term dependencies.
query expansion, in the form of pseudo-relevance feedback or relevance feedback, is a common technique used to  improve retrieval effectiveness.
