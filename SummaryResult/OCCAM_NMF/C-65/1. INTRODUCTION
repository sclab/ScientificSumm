the results and analysis of an independent evaluation of the  system at the us army aberdeen test center are also  presented. 
special emphasis is paid to the sensor fusion technique that estimates the  trajectory, range, caliber and weapon type simultaneously.
it describes the  hardware and software architecture including the custom sensor board equipped with a small microphone array and  connected to a cots micaz mote [12].
the paper presents the design and evaluation of our  soldierwearable mobile countersniper system.
finally, additional requirements called for caliber estimation and weapon classification in addition to source localization.
moreover, the system should be useful to even a single soldier.
as soldiers may work in groups of as little as four people, the number of sensors measuring the acoustic phenomena may be an order of magnitude smaller than before.
the sensor positions and orientation need to be constantly monitored.
113 to move from a static sensor network-based solution to a highly mobile one presents significant challenges.
a helmet-mounted system was developed in the mid 90s by bbn [3], but it was not continued beyond the darpa program that funded it.
while there are  vehiclemounted countersniper systems [1] available commercially, we are not aware of a deployed system that protects  dismounted soldiers.
as it is primarily the soldiers that the system protects, a natural extension is to mount the sensors on the soldiers themselves.
even if the sensors are cheap, it is still a waste and a logistical problem to provide a continuous stream of sensors as the operations move from place to place.
it is not practical to gather and reuse the sensors, especially under combat conditions.
depending on the operation, the deployment may be needed for an hour or a month, but eventually the area looses its importance.
once the sensors are distributed, they cover a  certain area.
the obvious disadvantage of such a system is its static nature.
the system has been tested several times in us army mout (military  operations in urban terrain) facilities.
this capability is due to the widely distributed sensing and the unique sensor fusion approach [8].
the truly unique  characteristic of the system is that it works in such reverberant environments as cluttered urban terrain and that it can  resolve multiple simultaneous shots at the same time.
pinptr is characterized by high  precision: 1m average 3d accuracy for shots originating within or near the sensor network and 1 degree bearing precision for both azimuth and elevation and 10% accuracy in range estimation for longer range shots.
the acoustic sensors measure the time of arrival (toa) of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves, pressure waves induced by the supersonic projectile, send the data to a base station where a sensor fusion algorithm determines the origin of the shot.
our team introduced pinptr, the first sensor  networkbased countersniper system [17, 8] in 2003. the system is based on potentially hundreds of inexpensive sensor nodes deployed in the area of interest forming an ad-hoc multihop network.
a countersniper system that provides almost  immediate shooter location to every soldier in the vicinity would provide clear benefits to the warfigthers.
by the time the soldiers can react, they are gone.
a mobile sniper team moves around busy city streets in a car, positions itself at a good standoff distance from dismounted us military personnel, takes a single well-aimed shot and immediately melts in the city traffic.
in october 2006 cnn reported on a new  tactic employed by insurgents.
the importance of countersniper systems is underscored by the constant stream of news reports coming from the middle east.
