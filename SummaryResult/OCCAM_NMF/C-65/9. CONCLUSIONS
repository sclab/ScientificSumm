other outstanding issues include weatherproof packaging and ruggedization, as well as  integration with current military infrastructure. 
experiments with a previous  generation sensor board indicated that this could provide a 10x increase in battery life.
when a trigger wakes up the board, the acoustic data would be immediately available.
the rest of the board could be turned off.
instead, the acoustic channels would need to be sampled and stored in a circular buffer.
an analog trigger circuit could solve this problem, however, the system would miss the first shot.
a deployable version of the sensor node would need to be asleep during normal  operation and only wake up when an interesting event occurs.
a current node runs on 4 aa batteries for about 12 hours of continuous operation.
we have not addresses power  management yet.
however, important aspects of the system would still need to be worked on.
we believe that the technology is mature enough that a next revision of the system could be a commercial one.
note that 87% of the shots were successfully localized by at least one of the ten sensors utilized in standalone mode.
while the overall  localization rate of 42% per sensor for shots up to 130 m could be improved, the bearing accuracy of less than a degree and the average 5% range error are remarkable using the  handmade prototypes of the low-cost nodes.
second, the performance of the system when used in  standalone mode, that is, when single sensors alone provided localization, was also very good.
we believe that with the lessons learned in the test, a consecutive field experiment could have showed significantly improved results especially in range estimation beyond 100 m and weapon classification for the remaining two weapons that were mistaken for each other the majority of the times during the test.
it is also worth mentioning that the results presented here  correspond to the first and only test of the system beyond 100 m and with six different weapons.
the key factor behind this is the sensor fusion algorithm"s ability to reject erroneous measurements.
the system proved to be very robust when increasing the node location and orientation errors and decreasing the number of available sensors all the way down to a couple.
most noteworthy are the trajectory accuracy of one degree, the correct caliber estimation rate of well over 90% and the close to 100% weapon classification rate for 4 of the 6 weapons tested.
first, the performance of the overall distributed networked system is excellent.
the main contribution of this work is twofold.
