they are also manufacturing experimental soldier wearable and uav mounted systems for military use [16], but no specifications or evaluation results are publicly  available. 
shotspotter reports 25 m typical accuracy which is more than enough for police to 125 respond.
the goal of the system is significantly different than that of military systems.
the company shotspotter specializes in law enforcement systems that report the location of gunfire to police within seconds.
note that bbn"s current vehicle-mounted system called boomerang, a modified version of bullet ears, is currently used in iraq [1].
this is especially important for operation in acoustically reverberant urban areas.
a sensor networked based solution has the advantage of widely distributed  sensing for better coverage, multipath effect compensation and multiple simultaneous shot resolution [8].
the problem with this and similar centralized  systems is the need of the one or handful of microphone arrays to be in line-of-sight of the shooter.
the range accuracy was around 5 percent for both of the  systems.
the angle accuracy of the fixed system was dominantly less than one degree while it was around five degrees for the helmet mounted one.
the fixed systems performance was one  order of magnitude better in the angle calculations while their range performance where matched.
an extensive test has been conducted to measure the performance of both type of systems.
there is a low speed rf  connection from the helmet to the processing body.
the soldier-worn system has 12 microphones as well as a gps antenna and orientation  sensors mounted on a helmet.
the overall system consists of two to three of these arrays spaced 20 to 100 meters from each other.
the fixed system has tetrahedron shaped  microphone arrays with 1.5 meter spacing.
researchers at bbn have developed the bullet ears system [3] which has the capability to be installed in a fixed position or worn by soldiers.
a related topic is the research and development of  experimental and prototype shooter location systems.
note that the available computational performance on the sensor nodes, the limited wireless bandwidth and real-time requirements render these approaches infeasible on our platform.
it also demonstrates how the length of the shockwave, as determined by the edge  detectors, can be used along with whithams equations [20] to estimate the caliber of a projectile.
a paper by sadler [14] compares two shockwave edge detection methods: a simple gradient-based detector, and a multi-scale wavelet detector.
the edges of the shockwave are typically well defined and the shockwave length is directly related to the bullet  characteristics.
mays  concludes that the dwt is the best method for classifying  signals as either shockwaves or muzzle blasts because it works well and is less expensive to compute than the spwvd [10].
joint time-frequency (jtf) spectrograms are used to analyze the typical separation of the shockwave and  muzzle blast transients in both time and frequency.
possible techniques for classifying signals as  either shockwaves or muzzle blasts includes short-time fourier transform (stft), the smoothed pseudo wigner-ville  distribution (spwvd), and a discrete wavelet transformation (dwt).
the focus is on the robust detection and length estimation of small caliber acoustic shockwaves and  muzzle blasts.
another area of research is the signal processing of gunfire acoustics.
results indicate that ground interaction becomes a problem for miss distances of 30 meters or larger.
the measurements of the ballistic shockwaves using calibrated pressure transducers at known locations, measured bullet speeds, and miss distances of  355 meters for 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm projectiles were made.
experiments with greater distances from the muzzle were  conducted by stoughton [18].
fansler"s work gives a good idea of the ideal muzzle blast pressure wave without contamination from echoes or propagation effects [4].
fansler analyzed the complex near-field pressure waves that occur within a foot of the muzzle blast.
the area has a close  relevance to the topic of supersonic flow mechanics [20].
acoustic detection and recognition has been under  research since the early fifties.
