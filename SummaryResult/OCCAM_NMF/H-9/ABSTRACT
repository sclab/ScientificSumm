categories and subject descriptors: h.3.3  [information search and retrieval]: clustering, search process general terms: algorithm, experimentation 
compared with the traditional methods of clustering search results, our method can give better result organization and more  meaningful labels.
we evaluate our proposed method on a commercial search engine log data.
in this paper, we propose to address these two  deficiencies by (1) learning interesting aspects of a topic from web search logs and organizing search results accordingly; and (2) generating more meaningful cluster labels using past query words entered by users.
however, two deficiencies of this approach make it not always work well: (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the user"s perspective; and (2) the cluster labels generated are not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster.
clustering search results is an effective way to organize search results, which allows a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly.
effective organization of search results is critical for  improving the utility of any search engine.
