finally, we can combine a general search log with any  personal search log to customize and optimize the organization of search results for each individual user. 
it would thus be interesting to study how to further improve the  organization of the results based on such feedback information.
second, with the proposed way of organizing search results, we can  expect to obtain informative feedback information from a user (e.g., the aspect chosen by a user to view).
in  particular, we hope to develop probabilistic models for learning aspects and organizing results simultaneously.
it would be interesting to explore other potentially more effective methods.
there are several interesting directions for further  extending our work: first, although our experiment results have clearly shown promise of the idea of learning from search logs to organize search results, the methods we have  experimented with are relatively simple.
furthermore, our log-based method can generate more  meaningful aspect labels than the cluster labels generated based on search results when we cluster search results.
the experiments show that our log-based method can consistently outperform cluster-based method and improve over the ranking baseline, especially when the queries are difficult or the search results are diverse.
we compared our log-based method with the  traditional cluster-based method and the baseline of search  engine ranking.
given a query, we retrieve its related queries from past query history, learn the aspects by  clustering the past queries and the associated clickthrough  information, and categorize the search results into the aspects learned.
to attain this goal, we rely on search engine logs to learn interesting aspects from users" perspective.
in this paper, we studied the problem of organizing search results in a user-oriented manner.
