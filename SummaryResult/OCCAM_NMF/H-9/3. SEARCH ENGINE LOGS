all these pseudo-documents form our history data collection, which is used to learn interesting aspects in the following section. 
the keywords contained in the queries themselves can be regarded as brief summaries of the pseudo-documents.
that is, for each unique query, we build a pseudo-document which consists of all the descriptions of its clicks in all the sessions aggregated.
in order to improve the scalability and reduce data sparseness, we aggregate all the sessions which contain  exactly the same queries together.
thus the number of sessions could be quite huge and the  information in the sessions with the same queries could be  redundant.
different sessions may contain the same queries.
all the titles, snippets, and urls of the clicked web pages of that query are used to represent the session.
specifically, given the query in a session, we obtain its top-ranked results using the search engine from which we obtained our log data, and extract the snippets of the urls that are clicked on according to the log information in the corresponding session.
to gather rich information, we enrich each url with additional text content.
however, this information is limited since urls alone are not informative enough to tell the  intended meaning of a submitted query accurately.
each session contains the information of the text query and the clicked web page urls, together with the time that the user did the clicks.
as shown above, search engine logs consist of sessions.
1. car rental, hertz car rental, enterprise car rental, ... 2. car pricing, used car, car values, ... 3. car accidents, car crash, car wrecks, ... 4. car audio, car stereo, car speaker, ... in order to learn aspects from search engine logs, we  preprocess the raw logs to build a history data collection.
as an example, the following is some aspects about car learned from our search log data (see section 5).
by mining all the queries which are related to the concept of car, we can learn the aspects that are likely interesting from a user"s perspective.
some are looking for renting a car, thus may submit a query like car rental; some are more interested in buying a used car, and may submit a query like used car; and others may care more about buying a car accessory, so they may use a query like car audio.
different users are probably interested in different aspects of car.
for example, in the search logs, a lot of queries are related to car and this reflects that a large number of users are interested in information about car.
a small sample of search log data is shown in table 1. our idea of using search engine logs is to treat these logs as past history, learn users" interests using this history data automatically, and represent their interests by  representative queries.
a session includes a single query and all the urls that a user clicked after issuing the query [24].
search engine logs are separated by sessions.
they generally have the following  information: text queries that users submitted, the urls that they clicked after submitting the queries, and the time when they clicked.
web search.
different id"s mean different sessions.
search engine logs record the activities of web users, which reflect the actual users" needs or interests when conducting id query url time 1 win zip http://www.winzip.com xxxx 1 win zip http://www.swinzip.com/winzip xxxx 2 time zones http://www.timeanddate.com xxxx ... ... ... ... table 1: sample entries of search engine logs.
