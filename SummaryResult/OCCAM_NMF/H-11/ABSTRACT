experimental results on corel database suggest that the proposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback  image retrieval.
we discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of  images, which gives us the most amount of information.
by constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph laplacian.
specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (or, labels) are close as well.
our algorithm is based on a regression model which  minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space.
in this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called laplacian  optimal design (lod), for relevance feedback image retrieval.
the challenge is thus to  determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples.
however, the top returned images may not be the most informative ones.
the user"s labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and  irrelevant images.
it solicits the user"s relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the cbir systems.
relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance  contentbased image retrieval (cbir) performance.
