we are currently examining how to employ machine  learning algorithms to learn the optimal value of α based on a collection of features of the input pages. 
we demonstrated that it is feasible to build a large scale  classifier that has sufficient good precision for this application.
in lower quality pages we are more likely to make classification errors that will then negatively impact the matching.
the effectiveness of the syntactic match depends on the quality of the pages used.
however in all cases the optimal value of α is between 0.25 and 0.9 indicating significant effect of the semantic score component.
as shown in our experimental evaluation, the optimal value of the parameter α depends on the precise objective of optimization (precision at particular position, precision at given recall).
the semantic match is complemented with a syntactic match and the final score is a convex  combination of the two sub-scores with the relative weight of each determined by a parameter α. we evaluated the semantic-syntactic approach against a syntactic approach over a set of pages with different  contextual advertising.
as the classification relies on the full content of the page, it is more robust than  individual page phrases.
the semantic match relies on the classification of pages and ads into a 6000 nodes commercial advertising taxonomy to  determine their topical distance.
in this paper we proposed a novel way of matching  advertisements to web pages that rely on a topical (semantic) match as a major component of the relevance score.
however, individual phrases and words might have multiple meanings and/or be unrelated to the overall topic of the page leading to miss-matched ads.
a natural extension of search advertising is to extract phrases from the page and match them to the bid phrase of the ads.
all existing commercial contextual match solutions known to us evolved from search advertising solutions whereby a search query is matched to the bid phrase of the ads.
studies have shown that one of the main success factors for  contextual ads is their relevance to the surrounding content.
contextual advertising is the economic engine behind a large number of non-transactional sites on the web.
