stage 3: the payment for agent i is 0 if oi(c) = 0; the payment is κi(o, c−i) if oi(c) = 1. theorem 5. the payment defined by our general framework is minimum among all truthful payment schemes using o as output. 
stage 2: based on the allocation rule o, find the cut value κi(o, c−i) for agent i such that oi(c|i di) = 1 when di < κi(o, c−i), and oi(c|i di) = 0 when di > κi(o, c−i).
otherwise, define the payment scheme p as follows.
if it does not, then there is no payment scheme p such that mechanism m = (o, p) is truthful.
we now summarize the process to design a truthful payment scheme for a binary demand game based on an output method o. general framework 1 truthful mechanism design for a binary demand game stage 1: check whether the allocation rule o satisfies mp.
the details are omitted here due to space limit.
the equivalence of the monotonicity property of the allocation rule o and the existence of a truthful mechanism using o can be extended to games beyond binary demand games.
thus, it has no incentive to lie.
if di ≤ κi(o, c−i), then its utility becomes κi(o, c−i) − ci ≤ 0 since it is selected now.
if di > κi(o, c−i), then i gets the same payment and utility since it is still not selected.
in this case, when i reveals its true valuation, its payment is 0 and the utility is 0. now consider the situation when i declares a valuation di = ci.
case 2: ci ≥ κ(o, c−i).
thus, it has no incentive to lie in this case.
if di > κi(o, c−i), then its utility becomes 0 since it is not selected anymore.
if di < κi(o, c−i), then i gets the same payment and utility since it is still selected.
in this case, when i declares its true cost ci, its utility is κi(o, c−i) − ci > 0. now consider the  situation when i declares a cost di = ci.
case 1: ci < κ(o, c−i).
there are two cases here.
in the following we prove that this payment scheme also satisfies ic property.
thus, its utility is κi(o, c−i) − ci > 0, which implies that the payment scheme satisfies the ir.
the payment scheme is: if oi(c) = 1, then agent i gets payment pi(c) = κi(o, c−i); else it gets payment pi(c) = 0. from condition 1, if oi(c) = 1 then ci > κi(o, c−i).
we then show condition 1 implies condition 3. we prove this by constructing a payment scheme and proving that this payment scheme is truthful.
this inequality implies that ci1 > ci2 , which is a contradiction.
consequently, we have p1 i −ci2 > p0 i > p1 i −ci1 .
since m = (o, p) is truthful, we have p0 i < p1 i − ci2 .
similarly, if it lies its valuation to ci1 , its utility is p0 i .
its utility is p1 i − ci2 when it reports its true valuation.
now consider the scenario when the actual valuation of agent i is ci = ci2 .
since m = (o, p) is truthful, we have p0 i > p1 i − ci1 .
when agent i lies its valuation to ci2 , its utility is p1 i − ci1 .
now fix c−i, the utility for i when ci = ci1 is ui(ci1 ) = p0 i .
to prove this direction, we assume there exists an agent i and two valuation vectors c|i ci1 and c|i ci2 , where ci1 < ci2 , oi(c|i ci2 ) = 1 and oi(c|i ci1 ) = 0. from corollary 2, we know that pi(c|i ci1 ) = p0 i and pi(c|i ci2 ) = p1 i .
we then show condition 3 implies condition 2. the proof of this is similar to a proof in [13].
the proof that condition 2 implies condition is  straightforward and is omitted here.
3. there exists a truthful payment scheme p for this binary  demand game.
2. the allocation rule o satisfies mp.
when ci = κi(o, c−i), oi(c) can be  either 0 or 1 depending on the tie-breaker of the allocation rule o. hereafter, we will not consider the tie-breaker scenario in our proofs.
for binary demand games, this definition implies that if oi(c|i ci2 ) = 1 then oi(c|i ci1 ) = 1. theorem 4. fix the setting s, c−i in a binary demand game g with the allocation rule o, the following three conditions are equivalent: 1. there exists a value κi(o, c−i)(which we will call a cut value, such that oi(c) = 1 if ci < κi(o, c−i) and oi(c) = 0 if ci > κi(o, c−i).
this definition is not restricted only to binary demand games.
an output method o is said to satisfy the monotone non-increasing property if for every agent i and two of its possible costs ci1 < ci2 , oi(c|i ci2 ) ≤ oi(c|i ci1 ).
215 3.2 existence of strategyproof mechanisms notice, given the setting s, a mechanism design problem is  composed of two parts: the allocation rule o and a payment scheme p. in this paper, given an allocation rule o we focus our attention on how to design a truthful payment scheme based on o. given an allocation rule o for a binary demand game, we first present a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a truthful payment scheme p. definition 1 (monotone non-increasing property (mp)).
hereafter, we will only consider normalized payment schemes.
this theorem implies that for the binary demand games we can always normalize the payment to an agent i such that the payment to the agent is 0 when it is not selected.
the proofs of above theorems are straightforward and thus  omitted due to space limit.
corollary 2. for any strategy-proof mechanism for a binary demand game g with setting s, if we fix the cost c−i of all agents other than i, the payment to agent i is a constant p1 i if oi(c) = 1, and it is another constant p0 i if oi(c) = 0. theorem 3. fixed the setting s for a binary demand game, if mechanism m = (o, p) satisfies ic, then mechanism m = (o, p ) with the same output method o and pi(c) = pi(c) − δi(c−i) for any function δi(c−i) also satisfies ic.
theorem 1. if a mechanism m = (o, p) satisfies ic, then ∀i, if oi(t|i ti1 ) = oi(t|i ti2 ), then pi(t|i ti1 ) = pi(t|i ti2 ).
3.1 properties of strategyproof mechanisms we discuss several properties that mechanisms need to satisfy in order to be truthful.
