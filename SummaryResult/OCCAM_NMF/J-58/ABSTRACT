in particular, we show how p can be computed through or/and combinations, round-based combinations, and some more complex combinations of the outputs from subgames.
we provide a general framework to  design such p. we further propose several general composition-based techniques to compute p efficiently for various types of output.
for these  problems, we prove that a truthful mechanism m = (o, p) exists with a proper payment method p iff the allocation rule o satisfies a  certain monotonicity property.
in light of these limitations, it is useful to study whether we can design a truthful non-vcg payment scheme that is computationally tractable for a given allocation rule o. in this paper, we focus our attention on binary demand games in which the agents" only  available actions are to take part in the a game or not to.
if we apply vcg mechanisms to polynomial-time algorithms that approximate the optimal solution, the resulting mechanisms may no longer be truthful.
for many optimization problems, finding the optimal output is computationally intractable.
they only apply to optimization problems with a utilitarian (or affine)  objective function, and their output should optimize the objective  function.
however, vcg mechanisms have their limitations.
the family of vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg) mechanisms is  arguably the most celebrated achievement in truthful mechanism  design.
