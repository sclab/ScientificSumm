in what follows, we assume that the set args(l) of arguments is finite, and each argument is attacked by a finite number of arguments. 
this is due to the fact that arguments of argsb(l) may be conflicting but not necessarily in a symmetric way.
a = a , a rl a • a ∈ argso(l) and a ∈ argsb(l) such that a rl a note that the relation rl is not symmetric.
formally: definition 1. rl ⊆ args(l) × args(l) is a conflict relation among arguments such that: • ∀a, a ∈ argso(l), s.t.
this avoids wishful thinking.
the third condition does not allow an argument in favor of an offer to attack an argument supporting a  belief.
the idea here is to return the strongest argument among these arguments.
the second hypothesis says that  arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting.
note that, the relation rl is not necessarily symmetric between the  arguments of argsb(l).
the idea behind this  assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose only one at a given step of the dialogue.
three assumptions are made on this relation: first the arguments supporting different offers are conflicting.
in what follows, those conflicts will be captured by the  relation rl, thus rl ⊆ args(l) × args(l).
since the knowledge bases from which arguments are built may be inconsistent, the arguments may be conflicting too.
as in [5], in what follows, we consider that the structure of the arguments is not known.
thus, args(l) = argso(l) ∪ argsb(l).
in what follows, the set args(l) is then divided into two subsets: a subset argso(l) of  arguments supporting offers, and a subset argsb(l) of arguments supporting beliefs.
consequently, in a  negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally exchanged between agents.
indeed, an  argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agent"s  beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an  argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments.
moreover, it has been acknowledged that the two categories of arguments are formally defined in  different ways, and they play different roles.
in [4], it has been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for decision making, two kinds of arguments are distinguished: arguments supporting choices (or decisions), and arguments supporting beliefs.
in [3], it has been argued that the selection of the best offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision problem.
by argument, we mean a reason in believing or of doing something.
different arguments can be built from l. the set args(l) will contain all those arguments.
for instance, if the agents try to decide the place of their next meeting, then the set o will contain different towns.
offers correspond to the different  alternatives that can be exchanged during a negotiation dialogue.
this means that the offers are different.
, on} of n offers is identified, such that oi, oj ∈ o such that oi ≡ oj.
from l, a set o = {o1, .
in what follows, l will denote a logical language, and ≡ is an equivalence relation associated with it.
