consequently, the set of acceptable offers, oa is empty as well. 
then the set of accepted arguments w.r.t a, def is emtpy.
theorem 7. let a, f, r, , def be a negotiating agent such that a = ao and is an acyclic relation.
using the above results we can prove the main theorem of this section that states that negotiating agents with acyclic preference relations do not have acceptable offers.
theorem 6. let a be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on a. then the preferred extensions of a, def are pairwise disjoint w.r.t arguments of ao.
if the relation on a is acyclic, then each extension ei of <a, def>, |ei| = 1. another direct consequence of the above theorem is that in acyclic preference relations, arguments that support offers can participate in only one preferred extension.
property 3. let a be a set of arguments such that a = ao.
theorem 5. let a be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on a. if e is an extension of <a, def>, then |e ∩ ao| = 1. an immediate consequence of the above is the following.
the previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations  sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
theorem 4. let a be a set of arguments, r the  attacking relation of a defined as r ⊆ a × a, and an acyclic relation on a. then for any pair of arguments a, b ∈ a, such that (a, b) ∈ r, either (a, b) ∈ def or (b, a) ∈ def (or both).
, an ∈ a, with n > 1, such that (ai, ai+1) ∈ r and (an, a1) ∈ r, with 1 ≤ i < n. note that acyclicity prohibits pairs of arguments a, b such that a b and b a, ie., an acyclic preference relation disallows indifference.
a relation r on a set a is acyclic if there is no sequence a1, a2, .
definition 9 (acyclic relation).
we now study acyclic preference relations that are defined formally as follows.
a b and b a).
theorem 3. let o1, o2 ∈ o. o1, o2 ∈ oa iff ∃ a1 ∈ f(o1), ∃ a2 ∈ f(o2), such that a1 and a2 are accepted and are indifferent w.r.t (i.e.
we first show that the set oa may contain several offers when their  corresponding accepted arguments are indifferent w.r.t the preference relation .
then the system returns at least one  extension e, such that |e| ≥ 1. we now present some results that demonstrate the  importance of indifference in negotiating agents, and more  specifically its relation to acceptable outcomes.
theorem 2. let a, def an argumentation system such that a = ao.
all of the agent"s arguments refer to offers), the corresponding argumentation system will return at least one non-empty preferred extension.
we first show that in the particular case where a = ao (ie.
theories in this section, we study the properties of the system  developed above.
