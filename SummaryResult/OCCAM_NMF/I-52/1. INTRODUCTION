these last are in a technical report that we will make available online at some later time. 
due to lack of space, the proofs are not  included.
section 8 concludes and presents some perspectives.
section 7 compares our formalism with existing ones.
section 6 illustrates our general framework through some examples.
two kinds of outcomes: optimal solution and compromise are defined, and we show when such outcomes are reached.
section 5 defines formally an argumentation-based negotiation, shows how the theories of agents may evolve during a  dialogue, and how this evolution may influence the outcome of the dialogue.
in section 4, we study the properties of these agents" theories.
section 3 defines the agents as well as their theories.
this paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the logical language that is used in the rest of the paper.
we show that dialogues generated under such a protocol terminate, and even reach optimal solutions when they exist.
then, we propose a protocol that  allows agents i) to exchange offers and arguments, and ii) to make concessions when necessary.
we define formally the notions of concession, compromise, and optimal solution.
we show how an agent"s theory may evolve during a negotiation dialogue.
consequently, the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets: acceptable, rejected, negotiable and non-supported offers.
the status of each argument is defined using dung"s acceptability semantics.
a theory  consists of a set a of arguments whose structure and origin are not known, a function specifying for each possible offer in o, the arguments of a that support it, a non specified conflict relation among the arguments, and finally a preference  relation between the arguments.
each agent is supposed to have a theory represented in an abstract way.
the goal of a negotiation is to find among elements of o, an offer that satisfies more or less 967 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas the preferences of both agents.
in this framework, a negotiation dialogue takes place between two agents on a set o of offers, whose structure is not known.
this paper aims to propose a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of argumentation is formally analyzed, and where the existing systems can be restated.
optimal solutions, or compromise) and concession are neither defined nor studied.
moreover, basic concepts in negotiation such as agreement (i.e.
it is not clear how argumentation can influence the outcome of the dialogue.
in most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues.
they have thus proposed an  argumentationbased decision model, and have shown how such a model can be related to the dialogue protocol.
in [3, 7], the authors argued that selecting an offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision  making problem.
others have emphasized on the decision making problem.
they have shown how and when arguments in favor of offers can be computed and  exchanged.
some researchers have mainly focused on relating argumentation with protocols.
however, the work is still  preliminary.
several proposals have been made in the literature for modeling such an approach.
however, the agent may change its mind if it receives a strong argument in favor of this offer.
for instance, an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for it.
their mental states) may evolve, and consequently, the status of offers may change.
the basic idea behind an  argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments, the  theories of the agents (i.e.
indeed, an offer supported by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by an agent, and can also make him reveal his goals or give up some of them.
integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a good means for supplying additional information and also helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments during a negotiation dialogue.
indeed, the two first types of settings do not allow for the  addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers.
an agent may concede a goal having a small priority), and consequently the outcome of the dialogue.
different approaches to automated negotiation have been investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which  usually assume complete information and unlimited  computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try to cope with these limitations [6], and argumentation-based approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the  importance of exchanging information and explanations between negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their  behaviors (e.g.
negotiation models have been proposed for the design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with other agents for example, buying or selling products in  ecommerce.
roughly speaking, negotiation is a process aiming at  finding some compromise or consensus between two or several agents about some matters of collective agreement, such as pricing products, allocating resources, or choosing  candidates.
