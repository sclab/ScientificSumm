by profile, we mean the criterion used by an agent to compare its offers. 
another interesting point to investigate is that of considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with different profiles.
our framework can thus be extended by integrating those criteria.
in [4],  different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions.
for instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest argument.
this preference relation can be refined.
in the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers.
considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.
this is more akin to the way human take decisions.
another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments pro and cons offers.
thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent theory.
arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.
during a  negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.
indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers.
a first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.
our future work concerns several points.
it is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative  negotiation dialogue is presented.
more precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the  theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.
this work is a first attempt to formally define the role of  argumentation in the negotiation process.
[11]) or heuristics ([6]).
[10]), our framework has all the advantages that argumentation-based negotiation approaches present when related to the negotiation approaches based either on game theoretic models (see e.g.
like any other argumentation-based negotiation framework, as it is evoked in (e.g.
in this paper we have presented a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation.
