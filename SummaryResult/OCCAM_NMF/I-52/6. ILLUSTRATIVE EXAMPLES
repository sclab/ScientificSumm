the dialogue ends by returning this offer as an outcome. 
at this step 4, the offer o2 is acceptable for both agents, thus it is an optimal solution.
thus, the offer o2 will be acceptable for the agent, whereas o1 will become rejected.
at this step, the argument a1 which was accepted will become rejected, and the argument a2 which was at the beginning of the dialogue rejected will become  accepted.
the following dialogue may take place between the two agents: p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o2, 1 p: m3 = p, a1, o1, 2 c: m4 = c, a3, θ, 3 c: m5 = p, θ, o2, 4 at step 4 of the dialogue, the agent p receives the  argument a3 from p. thus, its theory evolves as follows: ap = {a1, a2, a3}, rp = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, defp = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}.
consequently, the offer o2 is acceptable and o1 is rejected.
the argumentation system ac , defc of this agent will return a3 and a2 as accepted arguments, and a1 as a rejected one.
the theory of agent c is ac , fc , c , rc , defc such that: ac = {a1, a2, a3}, fc (o1) = {a1}, fc (o2) = {a2}, c = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, rc = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, defc = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}.
consequently, the offer o1 is acceptable and o2 is rejected.
the argumentation system ap , defp of this agent will return a1 as an accepted argument, and a2 as a rejected one.
the theory of agent p is ap , fp , p , rp , defp such that: ap = {a1, a2}, fp (o1) = {a1}, fp (o2) = {a2}, p = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, rp = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, defp = {(a1, a2)}.
let o = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers.
example 9 (dynamic theories).
let us now consider an example in which argumentation will allow agents to reach an agreement.
the negotiation fails because the agents have conflicting  preferences.
the reason is that the exchanged arguments are already known to both agents.
note that in both dialogues, the theories of both agents do not change.
the only possible dialogues that may take place between the two agents are the following: p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o2, 1 p: m3 = p, a1, o1, 2 c: m4 = c, a2, o2, 3 the second possible dialogue is the following: p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, a2, o2, 1 p: m3 = p, a1, o1, 2 c: m4 = c, θ, o2, 3 both dialogues end with failure.
the argumentation system ac , defc of this agent will return a2 as an accepted argument, and a1 as a rejected one.
the theory of agent c is ac , fc , c , rc , defc such that: ac = {a1, a2}, fc (o1) = {a1}, fc (o2) = {a2}, c = {(a2, a1)}, rc = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, defc = {a2, a1}.
the theory of agent p is ap , fp , p , rp , defp such that: ap = {a1, a2}, fp (o1) = {a1}, fp (o2) = {a2}, p = {(a1, a2)}, rp = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, defp = {a1, a2}.
example 8 (static theories).
let us now consider the following example.
p: m1 = p, θ, o2, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o1, 1 p: m3 = p, θ, o1, 2 note that in the above example, since there is no exchange of arguments, the theories of both agents do not change.
the last possible dialgue is the following that ends with o1 as a  compromise.
p: m1 = p, θ, o2, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o2, 1 this dialogue also ends with o2 as a compromise.
p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o2, 1 p: m3 = p, θ, o2, 2 this dialogue ends with o2 as a compromise.
note that this solution is not considered as optimal since it is not an  acceptable offer for the agents.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o1, 1 this dialogue ends with o1 as a compromise.
joint conf.
the proposed protocol (see definition 16) will generate one of the following dialogues: 972 the sixth intl.
in this case, it is clear that the two offers o1 and o2 are  nonsupported.
let p and c be two agents, equipped with the same theory: a, f, , r, def such that a = ∅, f(o1) = f(o2) = ∅, = ∅, r = ∅, def = ∅.
example 7 (no argumentation).
in this section we will present some examples in order to illustrate our general framework.
