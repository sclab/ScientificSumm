indeed, the pairwise correlation among all possible 3-week periods of the 15-week query stream is over 99.5%. 
the high correlation among the query term frequencies during different time periods explains the graceful adaptation of the static caching algorithms to the future query stream.
as figure 14 shows, the hit rate decreases by less than 2%.
to simulate a realistic scenario, we use the first 6 (3) weeks of the query stream for computing query term frequencies and the following 9 (12) weeks to estimate the hit rate.
this hit rate is as an upper bound, and it assumes perfect knowledge of the query term frequencies.
we compute the query term frequencies over the whole stream, select which terms to cache, and then compute the hit rate on the whole query stream.
we measured the effect on the qtfdf algorithm of the changes in a 15-week query stream (figure 14).
to estimate the time interval in which we need to recompute the posting lists on the static cache we need to consider an efficiency/quality trade-off: using too short a time interval might be prohibitively expensive, while  recomputing the cache too infrequently might lead to having an obsolete cache not corresponding to the statistical  characteristics of the current query stream.
the static cache of posting lists can be periodically  recomputed.
0.26 0.27 0.28 0.29 0.3 0.31 0.32 0.33 0.34 0.35 0.36 0.37 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 hit-rate time hits on the frequent queries of distances figure 13: hourly hit rate for a static cache holding 128,000 answers during the period of a week.
after a small decay in hit rate values, the hit rate stabilizes between 0.28, and 0.34 for the entire week, suggesting that the static cache is effective for a whole week after the training period.
we observe that the hit rate reaches its highest value during the night (around midnight), whereas around 2-3pm it reaches its minimum.
we report hit rate hourly for 7 days, starting from 5pm.
we then compute the hit rate of a static cache of 128, 000 answers trained over a period of two weeks (figure 13).
the majority of queries that appear in a given week repeat in the following weeks for the next six months.
we found that a very small  percentage of queries are new queries.
to support this claim, we first assess how topics change comparing the distribution of queries from the first week in june, 2006, to the  distribution of queries for the remainder of 2006 that did not appear in the first week in june.
for our query log, the query distribution and query-term distribution change slowly over time.
