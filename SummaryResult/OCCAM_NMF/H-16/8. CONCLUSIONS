our results show that for centralized and lan environments, there is an optimal allocation of caching query results and caching of posting lists, while for wan scenarios in which network time prevails it is more important to cache query results.
we present a framework for the analysis of the trade-off between caching query results and caching posting lists, and we simulate different types of architectures.
we also propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists that  outperforms previous static caching algorithms as well as dynamic algorithms such as lru and lfu, obtaining hit rate values that are over 10% higher compared these strategies.
caching terms is more effective with respect to miss rate, achieving values as low as 12%.
our results show that in our uk log, the minimum miss rate is 50% using a working set strategy.
dynamic caching of queries has limited effectiveness due to the high number of compulsory misses caused by the number of unique or infrequent queries.
we present results on both dynamic and static caching.
caching is an effective technique in search engines for improving response time, reducing the load on query  processors, and improving network bandwidth utilization.
