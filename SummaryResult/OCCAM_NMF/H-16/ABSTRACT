our results and observations are applicable to different levels of the data-access hierarchy, for instance, for a memory/disk layer or a broker/remote server layer.
finally, we measure how the changes in the query log affect the  effectiveness of static caching, given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time.
we also study the problem of finding the optimal way to split the static cache between answers and posting lists.
we propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists, which outperforms previous methods.
using a query log spanning a whole year we explore the  limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching posting lists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query  answers.
we explore the impact of different approaches, such as static vs. dynamic caching, and caching query results vs. caching posting lists.
in this paper we study the trade-offs in designing efficient caching systems for web search engines.
