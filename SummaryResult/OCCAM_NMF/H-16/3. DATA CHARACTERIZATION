the statistics of the collection are shown in table 1. we measured the correlation between the document frequency of terms in the collection and the number of queries that contain a particular term in the query log to be 0.424. a scatter plot for a random  sample of terms is shown in figure 3. in this experiment, terms have been converted to lower case in both the queries and the documents so that the frequencies will be comparable.
the distribution of document frequencies of terms in the collection follows a power law distribution with slope 2.38 (upper curve in figure 2).
the document collection that we use for our experiments is a summary of the uk domain crawled in may 2006.1 this summary corresponds to a maximum of 400 crawled  documents per host, using a breadth first crawling strategy,  comprising 15gb.
the query terms (middle curve) have been normalized for case, as have the terms in the document collection.
in this figure, the query frequencies were computed as they appear in the logs with no  normalization for case or white space.
as  expected, the distribution of query frequencies and query term frequencies follow power law distributions, with slope of 1.84 and 2.26, respectively.

the y-axis is table 1: statistics of the uk-2006 sample.
(the most frequent query appears closest to the y-axis.)
the x-axis represents the normalized frequency rank of the query or term.
figure 2 shows the distributions of queries (lower curve), and query terms (middle curve).

our data consists of a crawl of documents from the uk domain, and query logs of one year of queries submitted to http://www.yahoo.co.uk from november 2005 to november 2006. in our logs, 50% of the total volume of queries are unique.
