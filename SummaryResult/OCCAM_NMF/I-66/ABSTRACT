experimental results show orders of magnitude improvement in performance when compared with previous global optimal algorithms.
allowing easier scale-up to larger number of agents); (ii) it uses a combination of heuristics to speedup policy search; and (iii) it allows quality guaranteed approximations,  allowing a systematic tradeoff of solution quality for time.
this paper overcomes the limitations of both these approaches by providing spider, a novel combination of three key features for policy generation in  distributed pomdps: (i) it exploits agent interaction structure given a network of agents (i.e.
a second less popular approach focuses on global optimality, but typical results are available only for two agents, and also at considerable computational cost.
though this approach is efficient, the  algorithms within this approach do not provide any guarantees on  solution quality.
given the significant  complexity of solving distributed pomdps, particularly as we scale up the numbers of agents, one popular approach has focused on approximate solutions.
distributed partially observable markov decision problems  (distributed pomdps) are a popular approach for modeling multi-agent systems acting in uncertain domains.
