figure 1: a 3-chain sensor configuration 
given the sensors" observational uncertainty, the targets" uncertain transitions and the distributed nature of the sensor nodes, these sensor nets provide a useful domains for applying distributed pomdp models.
each agent incurs a cost for scanning whether the target is present or not, but no cost if it turns off.
the sensors"  observations and transitions are independent of each other"s actions e.g.the observations that sensor1 receives are independent of  sensor2"s actions.
based on the area it is scanning, each sensor receives observations that can have false positives and false negatives.
we assume that there are two independent targets and that each target"s movement is uncertain and unaffected by the sensor agents.
thus, sensors have to act in a coordinated fashion.
in figure 1, to track a target in  loc11, sensor1 needs to scan ‘east" and sensor2 needs to scan ‘west" simultaneously.
to track a target and obtain associated reward, two  sensors with overlapping scanning areas must coordinate by scanning the same area simultaneously.
here, each sensor node can scan in one of four directions: north, south, east or west (see figure 1).
figure 1 shows a specific problem instance within this type consisting of three sensors.
this paper focuses on a set of target tracking problems that arise in certain types of sensor networks [6] first introduced in [10].
distributed sensor networks are a large, important class of  domains that motivate our work.
