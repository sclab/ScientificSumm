it is thus  necessary to set up an effective communication protocol. 
as the choices of an agent will be influenced by the choices of the others, it is necessary that the agents should reason on a common knowledge about the requests.
let us notice that these criteria are not necessarily  compatible.
p si∈s p r∈at si costsi (r) is minimal.

agents si in e must build a set {at s1 .
let e be a swarm.
more formally, definition 4 (problem).
3.4 problem formalization then, our problem is the following: we would like each agent to build request allocations (i.e a plan) dynamically such as if these requests are carried out their number is the highest possible or the global cost is minimal.
a candidacy c is a tuple < idc , modc, sc , rc , obsc, dnlc >: - idc is an identifier; - modc ∈ {3, 2, ¬3, ¬2} is a modality; - sc ∈ s is the candidate agent; - rc ∈ rt sc is the request on which sc candidates; - obsc ∈ t is the realization date proposed by sc ; - dnlc ∈ t is the download date.
for a request r, an agent si may: - propose to carry out r : si may realize r; - commit to carry out r : si will realize r; - not propose to carry out r : si may not realize r; - refuse to carry out r : si will not realize r. we can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition c: si realizes r: - 3c means that si proposes to carry out r; - 2c means that si commits to carry out r; - ¬3c means that si does not propose to carry out r; - ¬2c means that si refuses to carry out r. more formally: definition 3 (candidacy).
3.3 candidacy an agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e.
in the sequel, we will note rt si the set of the requests that are known by agent si at time t ∈ t. for each request r in rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (r) ∈ r, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(r) an agent si can realize r. so, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value.
in our application, priorities are comprised between 1 and 5 (the highest).
thus a request with a high priority must be realized at all costs.
the priority prio(r) of a request represents how much it is important for the user, namely the request sender, that the request should be carried out.
a request r is defined as a tuple < idr, pos(r), prio(r), tbeg(r),br >: - idr is an identifier; - pos(r) is the geographic position of r; - prio(r) ∈ r is the request priority; - tbeg(r) ∈ t is the desired date of observation; - br ∈ {true, false} specifies if r has been realized.
formally, a request is defined as follows: definition 2 (request).
during the mission, new requests are sent to the agents by the ground or agents can generate new requests by themselves.
each agent is allocated a set of initial requests.
as we have seen previously, the requests are generated both on the ground and on board.
3.2 requests requests are the observation tasks that the satellite swarm must achieve.
1 this term will designate a satellite constellation with  intersatellite links.
as we have seen previously, this relation exists when the agents meet.
for a given agent and a given time, the vicinity relation returns the set of agents with whom it can communicate at that time.
in the sequel, we will assume that the agents share a  common clock.
sn}; - t ⊆ r+ or n+ is a set of dates with a total order <; - vicinity : s × t → 2s .
a satellite swarm e is a  triplet < s, t, vicinity >: - s is a set of n agents {s1 .
formally, a swarm is defined as follows: definition 1 (swarm).
at most, there will be a waste of resources.
carrying out a request cannot prevent another agent from carrying out another one, even the same one.
3.1 satellite swarm an observation satellite swarm1 is a multi-agent system where the requests do not have to be carried out in a fixed order and the agents (the satellites) do not have any physical interaction.
this approach has been developped through the objectagent architecture [38], teamagent [31], dips [14] or prospecting ants [12].
as each satellite is a single entity that is a piece of the global swarm, a multi-agent system fits to model satellite constellations [39].
