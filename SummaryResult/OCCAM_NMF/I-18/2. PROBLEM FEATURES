the features of the problem are the following: - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation; - pair communication around the poles; - no ground intervention during the planning process; - asynchronous requests with various priorities. 
intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.
a judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar  areas, and thus can communicate without the ground  intervention.
the constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.
the satellites are also equipped with a  detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points and generates observation requests on-board.
a minimum duration is necessary to move the mirror, so  requests that are too close together cannot be realized by the same satellite.
the satellites are equipped with a single observation  instrument whose mirror can roll to shift the line of sight.
the ground sends the constellation observation requests characterized by their  geographical positions, priorities specifying if the requests are urgent or not, the desired dates of observation and the  desired dates for data downloading.
an observation satellite constellation is a set of satellites in various orbits whose mission is to take pictures of various areas on the earth surface, for example hot points  corresponding to volcanos or forest fires.
