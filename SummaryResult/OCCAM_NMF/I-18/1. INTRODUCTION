we will present the features of our problem, a communication protocol, a method for request allocation and finally,  collaboration strategies.
at the individual level, agents are deliberative in order to create a local plan but at the collective level, they use normative decision rules in order to coordinate with one another.
the objective of this work is to use intersatellite  connections, called intersatellite links or isl, in an earth  observation constellation inspired from the fuego mission [13, 19], in order to increase the system reactivity and to improve the mission global return through a hybrid agent approach.
however, an agent cannot always communicate with another agent or the  communication possibilites are restricted to short time intervals.
as protocols are  originally designed for a single goal, some works aim at  endowing them with flexibility [8, 26].
auml [32] or petri-nets [23].
they may be represented in a variety of ways, e.g.
protocols can be viewed as an abstraction of an  interaction [9].
exchanging information, finding a trade-off, allocating tasks and so on.
a protocol defines interactions between agents and cannot be uncoupled from its goal, e.g.
communication can be achieved through a stigmergic  approach (via the environment) or through message exchange and a protocol.
however, communication is still needed in order to share information and build collective conjectures and plans.
strategies are private decision rules that allow an agent to draw benefit from the knowledgeable world without  communication.
norms constraint agents in their decisions in such a way that the possibilities of conflicts are reduced.
in order to relax communication constraints, coordination based on norms and conventions [16] or strategies [17] are considered.
for instance, coalition-based [37], contract-based [35] and all  negotiationbased [25] mechanisms need these capabilities, especially in dynamic environments.
however, this step needs high communication and computation capabilities.
a coordination step must be added to the planning step [40, 30, 11].
in a multi-agent context, agents that build a collective plan must be able to change their goals, reallocate resources and react to environment changes and to the others" choices.
mono-agent planning [4, 18, 28] and task allocation [20] are widely studied.
multi-agent architectures have been developed for satellite swarms [36, 38, 42] but strong assumptions on deliberation and communication capabilities are made in order to build a collective plan.
moreover, the use of satellite swarms - sets of satellites flying in formation or in constellation around the  earthmakes it possible to consider joint activities, to distribute skills and to ensure robustness.
much research has been undertaken to increase satellite autonomy such as enabling them to solve by themselves problems that may occur during a mission, adapting their behaviour to new events and transferring planning on-board ; even if the development cost of such a satellite is increased, there is an increase in performance and mission possibilities [34].
