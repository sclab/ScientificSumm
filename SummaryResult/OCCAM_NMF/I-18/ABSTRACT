categories and subject descriptors h.4 [information systems applications]: miscellaneous; i.2.8 [artificial intelligence]: problem solving, control methods, and search-plan execution, formation, and  generation; i.2.11 [artificial intelligence]: distributed  artificial intelligence-coherence and coordination general terms algorithms 
we will present the  formalization of the problem, a communication protocol, a solving method based on reactive decision rules, and first results.
we aim at defining  individual behaviours that result in a global behaviour that meets the mission requirements.
the paper deals with on-board planning for a satellite swarm via communication and negotiation.
