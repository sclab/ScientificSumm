indeed, the chosen planning approach results in a combinatory explosion with big sets of requests: an anytime or a fully reactive approach has to be considered for more complex problems.
a second point is to take into account the complexity of the initial planning problem.
future works will focus on new strategies to solve new conflicts, specially those arising when relaxing the  independence assumption between the requests.
to what extent are the number of redundancies and the  average cost affected by the tuning of the strategies?
what is the trade-off between the constraint rate of the problem and the need of strategies?
some simulations have been made to experimentally  validate these protocols and the first results are promising but raise many questions.
through the tuning of the strategies (α, and λ) and their plastic interlacing within the protocol, it is  possible to coordinate agents without additional communication: the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same between informed simulations and simulations implementing strategies.
reactive decision rules  (strategies) are proposed to solve conflicts that may arise between agents.
an epidemic  communication protocol uses all communication opportunities to update this information.
agents reason both on requests to carry out and on the other agents" intentions (candidacies).
in order to increase the global mission outcome, we propose an hybrid approach: deliberative for individual planning and reactive for  collaboration.
an observation satellite swarm is a cooperative  multiagent system with strong constraints in terms of  communication and computation capabilities.
