instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 
recently, opera has developed the opera mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide  access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.
with the emergence of web browsing on small display  devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like wap and specialized native web browsers have been  developed to tailor the needs of these devices.
our  thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production  systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.
they work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the pda device that communicate with the proxy.
other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].
pthinc builds on previous work by two of the authors on thinc [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client  interface and usage model to efficiently support pda devices for mobile web applications.
this limits their display quality, system performance,  available screen space, and overall usability on pdas.
unlike pthinc, they do not address key  system architecture and usability issues important for pdas.
these systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for pdas.
many thin clients have been developed and some have pda clients, including microsoft"s remote desktop [3],  citrix metraframe xp [2], virtual network computing [16, 12], gotomypc [5], and tarantella [18].
our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in pda environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different pda devices, and the  performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.
the study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.
this study  demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web  browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.
the ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on  wireless pdas was first quantitatively demonstrated in a  previous study by one of the authors [10].
several studies have examined the web browsing  performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].
