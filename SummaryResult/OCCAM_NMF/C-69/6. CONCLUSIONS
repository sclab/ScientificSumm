in addition, pthinc is the only pda thin client 151 figure 11: video screenshot: rdp 640x480 figure 12: video screenshot: vnc 1024x768 figure 13: video screenshot: ica resized 1024x768 figure 14: video screenshot: pthinc resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content  accessible to mobile web users. 
our results on multiple  mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pthinc delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native pda browser.
we have implemented pthinc and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.
pthinc transparently supports traditional  desktop browsers and their helper applications on pda devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with  ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.
pthinc provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing,  clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, yuv video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing pda control buttons for ui  elements.
we have introduced pthinc, a thin-client architecture for wireless pdas.
