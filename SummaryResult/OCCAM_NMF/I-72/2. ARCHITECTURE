(section 4) • similarity estimation: how can the producer agent estimate similarity between the request and available services?
(section 3) • service offering: how can the producers revise their offers based on the consumer"s preferences that they have learned so far?
this challenge can be studied in three stages: • preference learning: how can the producers learn about each customer"s preferences based on requests and counter offers?
hence, the producer will have to understand the needs of the consumer from their interactions and generate a counter offer that is likely to be accepted by the consumer.
however, the consumer"s preferences in most cases will not be available.
both the consumer"s current request and the producer"s own available services are accessible by the producer.
when the producer constructs its offer, it should consider figure 1: proposed negotiation architecture three important things: the current request, consumer preferences and the producer"s available services.
one of the crucial challenges of the content-oriented negotiation is the automatic generation of counter offers by the service  producer.
this process will continue until some service is accepted by the consumer agent or all possible offers are put  forward to the consumer by the producer.
otherwise, the customer will generate a new request or stick to the previous request.
if it is acceptable, then the negotiation will end.
when the consumer receives a counter offer from the producer, it will evaluate it.
otherwise, the producer offers an alternative wine from the inventory.
if the producer has the requested wine in its inventory, the producer offers the wine and the negotiation ends.
this is the particular wine that the customer is interested in purchasing.
in the wine example, these features include color, winery and so on.
the request is composed of significant features of the  service.
the negotiation takes place in a turn-taking fashion, where the consumer agent starts the negotiation with a particular service  request.
those are used to decide which product will be offered when there exists more than one product having same similarity to the request of the consumer agent.
ratings indicate the popularity of the products among customers.
the data repository includes information on the products the producer owns, the number of the products and ratings of those products.
the data repository in figure 1 is used solely by the producer agent and holds the inventory information of the producer.
with this ontology, the service that is being negotiated between the consumer and the producer is that of selling wine.
the wine ontology describes different types of wine and includes features such as color, body, winery of the wine and so on.
however, to make our discussion concrete, we use the well-known wine ontology [19] with some modification to  illustrate our ideas and to test our system.
since a service can be anything such as selling a car, reserving a hotel room, and so on, the architecture is independent of the  ontology used.
further, since an ontology can represent concepts, their properties and their relationships semantically, the agents can reason the details of the service that is being negotiated.
this ontology describes the content of the service.
a shared ontology provides the necessary vocabulary and hence enables a common language for agents.
similarly, the producer agent has access to the producer"s inventory and knows which wines are available or not.
the consumer agent generates requests in accordance with these preferences and negotiates with the producer based on these preferences.
the consumer agent  represents the customer and hence has access to the preferences of the customer.
figure 1 depicts our architecture.
our main components are consumer and producer agents, which communicate with each other to perform content-oriented  negotiation.
