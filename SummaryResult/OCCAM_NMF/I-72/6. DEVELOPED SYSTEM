in the first ontology, there are 19 available wine products and in the second ontology, there are 50 products. 
we have prepared two separate winestock ontologies for testing.
the individuals represent available services that the producer owns.
ontology involves the  individuals of this class.
this class is necessary for the producer to record the wines that it sells.
winestock ontology is the producer"s inventory and describes a product class as wineproduct.
in this case, we assume that light is 0.66 similar to medium but only 0.33 to strong.
for example, the body can be light, medium, or strong.
when that is the case, we give the reasonable similarity values for these features.
on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (aamas 07) for some features such as body, flavor and sugar, there is no hierarchical information, but their values are semantically leveled.
joint conf.
1306 the sixth intl.
in this part, some reasoning can be made such as if a concept x covers y and y covers z, then concept x covers z. for example, europe continent covers bordeaux.
this  hierarchical information is used in estimation of semantic similarity.
western country covers french region, which covers some territories such as loire, bordeaux and so on.
for instance, we can represent the information europe continent covers  western country.
in addition to wine description, the hierarchical information of some features can be inferred from the ontology.
this allows us to consider instances of chardonnay wine as instances of wine class.
intuitively, any wine type  described in the ontology also represents a wine concept.
also a  variety of wine types are described in this ontology such as burgundy, chardonnay, cheninblanc and so on.
thus, all  possible values for the components of the wine concept such as color, body, sugar and so on can be reached by both agents.
the consumer agent and the producer agent obtain the possible values for the these properties by querying the ontology.
according to the ontology, seven properties make up the wine concept.
all participants of the  negotiation use this ontology for understanding each other.
it includes the description of wine as a concept and different types of wine.
the shared ontology is the modified version of the wine ontology [19].
we use owl [11] as our ontology language and jena as our ontology reasoner.
in this section, we explain the implementation details of the developed system.
the producer agent is fully automated and the learning and service offering operations work as explained before.
to ease testing of the system, the consumer agent has a user interface that allows us to enter various requests.
we have implemented our architecture in java.
