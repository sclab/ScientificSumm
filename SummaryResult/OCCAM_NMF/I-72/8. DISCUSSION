these are interesting directions that we will pursue in our future work. 
further, by using  relationships among features, the producer can discover new  knowledge from the existing knowledge.
in our future work, we plan to integrate ontology reasoning into the learning algorithm so that hierarchical information can be learned from subsumption hierarchy of relations.
on the contrary, we learn these preferences over time.
assume that the weights for service variables are fixed a priori.
in their experiments, faratin et al.
unlike them, we also take into  account the previous requests of the consumer.
only use the last offer made by the consumer in calculating the  similarity for choosing counter offer.
faratin et al.
although we address a similar problem, we learn the preferences of the  customer by the help of inductive learning and generate counter-offers in accordance with these learned preferences.
they generate a  heuristic model for trade-offs including fuzzy similarity estimation and a hill-climbing exploration for possibly acceptable offers.
propose a multi-issue negotiation mechanism, where the service variables for the negotiation such as price, quality of the service, and so on are considered traded-offs against each other (i.e., higher price for earlier delivery) [4].
while they study the effect of time on negotiation, our focus is on learning preferences for a successful negotiation.
our focus is different.
compared to fatima et al.
time interval  affects these agents differently.
in their approach, the goal of the seller agent is to sell the service for the highest possible price whereas the goal of the buyer agent is to buy the good with the lowest possible price.
study the factors that affect the negotiation such as preferences, deadline, price and so on, since the agent who  develops a strategy against its opponent should consider all of them [5].
fatima et al.
after the consumer and  producer agree on the service, price-oriented negotiation mechanisms can be used to agree on the price.
in our approach, we are interested in negotiation the content of the service.
their approach is probabilistic since the behavior of the partners can change at each iteration.
for achieving this, they use case-based reasoning.
brzostowski and kowalczyk propose an approach to select an  appropriate negotiation partner by investigating previous multi-attribute negotiations [1].
"s study is not concerned with learning preferences of each other.
contrary to our approach, sadri et al.
each agent in the system plans its actions to reach a goal state.
these  dialogues include offering resources, resource exchanges and offering alternative resource.
the mechanism relies on observe-think-action agent cycle.
a mechanism which is based on dialogue sequences among agents is proposed as a solution.
agents have limited resources and need to require  missing resources from other agents.
study negotiation in the context of resource  allocation [14].
sadri et al.
further, we have built a system with which negotiation preferences can be learned.
model the negotiation protocol using ontologies, we have instead modeled the service to be negotiated.

while the sixth intl.
thus, the agents can perform negotiation protocol by using this shared ontology without the need of being hard coded of negotiation protocol details.
according to their approach, the negotiation protocols used in e-commerce can be modeled as ontologies.
[16] propose a new approach based on ontology for  negotiation.
tama et al.
we review the recent literature in comparison to our work.
