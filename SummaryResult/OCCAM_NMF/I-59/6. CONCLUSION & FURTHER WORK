therefore, we intend to utilize the  approach to realize a recommender system in a more  privacysensitive domain, such as health or finance, which would enable us to better evaluate user acceptance. 
generally, the feedback we have obtained from users of the smart event assistant indicates that most users are  indifferent to privacy in the context of entertainment-related  personal information.
we envision various areas of future work: to achieve  complete user privacy, the protocol should be extended in order to keep the recommendations themselves private as well.
as a proof of concept, we have used the approach within an application supporting users in planning entertainment-related activities.
by utilizing  fundamental features of agents such as autonomy, adaptability and the ability to communicate, by extending the capabilities of agent platform managers regarding control of agent  communication, by providing a privacy-preserving protocol for information filtering processes, and by utilizing suitable  filtering techniques we have been able to realize an approach which actually preserves privacy in information filtering  architectures in a multilateral way.
we have developed an agent-based approach for  privacypreserving recommender systems.
