the paper concludes with an overview of the results and an outlook for future research in section 6. 
section 5 briefly reviews some other  commitment types, such as inductive, mixed and mixed conditional  commitments.
we point out an  equivalence between extortions and backward induction solutions, and investigate whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to pareto efficiency.
in section 4 we propose the generic  concept of an extortion, which for each commitment type captures the idea of an optimal commitment profile.
after briefly discussing related work in section 2, we present the formal game theoretic framework, in which we define the  notions of a commitment type as well as conditional and unconditional commitments (section 3).
our approach, however, differs in that it is assumed that the players all move in a  particular order-first, second, third and so on-and that it is specifically aimed at incorporating a wide range of possible commitments, in particular conditional commitments.
these games analyze situations in which a leader commits to a pure or mixed strategy, and a number of followers, who then act simultaneously.
our analysis is conceptually similar to that of stackelberg or leadership games [15], which have been extensively studied in the economic literature (cf., [16]).
a mechanism, on the other hand, could be seen as a set of commitments that steers the players" behavior in a certain desired way (see, e.g., [2]).
in the former setting, the inability to re-program a software agent on the fly can be seen as a commitment to its specification and thus exploited to strengthen its strategic position in a multiagent setting.
for example,  commitments have been argued to be of importance for interacting  software agents as well as for mechanism design.
nowadays, we believe, these issues are equally significant for  applications and developments in such fields as multiagent systems,  distributed computing and electronic markets.
insight into these matters has proved itself invaluable for a proper understanding of diplomatic policy during the cold war.
we also provide a framework for the assessment of more  general game theoretic matters like the relationship of extortions to backward induction or pareto efficiency.
on this basis we tackle such issues as the usefulness of certain types of commitment in different situations (strategic games) or whether it is better to commit early rather than late.
despite schelling"s warning for too abstract a framework, our approach will be based on the formal notion of an extortion, which we will propose in section 4 as a uniform tactic for a comprehensive class of situations in which commitments can be made sequentially.

what we want is a theory that systematizes the study of the various universal ingredients that make up the move-structure of games; too abstract a model will miss them.
in reply to this criticism schelling remarks: while it is instructive and intellectually satisfying to see how such tactics as threats, commitments, and promises can be absorbed in an enlarged, abstract  supergame (game in normal form), it should be  emphasized that we cannot learn anything about those tactics by studying games that are already in normal form.
one might object, that  commitments could be seen as the actions of a larger game.
in this respect, schelling"s view might seem to evince a more comprehensive understanding of what game theory tries to accomplish.
by focusing on the selection of actions rather than on  commitments, it might seem that the conception of game theory as mere interactive decision theory is too narrow.
some situations even allow for  commitments on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions.
besides simply committing to the performance of an action, an agent might make his commitment conditional on the actions of other agents, as, e.g., the kidnapper does, when he promises to set free a hostage on receiving a ransom, while threatening to cut off another toe, otherwise.
commitments come in different forms and it may depend on the circumstances which ones can and which ones cannot credibly be made.
performing a particular action means doing so to the exclusion of all other actions.
action itself could be seen as the ultimate commitment.
by commitments we will  understand such limitations of one"s action space.
promises and threats epitomize one of the fundamental and at first sight perhaps most surprising phenomena in game  theory: it may occur that a player can improve his strategic position by limiting his own freedom of action.
in this sense, promises and threats essentially involve a commitment on the part of the one who makes them, thus purposely restricting his freedom of choice.
likewise, a threat only succeeds in deterring an agent if the latter can be made to believe that the threatener is bound to execute the threat, should it be ignored.
the potency of a promise, however, essentially depends on the extent the promisee can be convinced of the promiser"s resolve to see to its fulfillment.
e.g., the strategic lie of the land may be such that a promise, a threat, or a combination of both would be more conductive to his ends.
apart from merely choosing and performing an action from a set of actions, there may also be other courses open to an agent.
from this perspective, the formal model of a game in strategic form only outlines the strategic features of an interactive situation.
is not concerned with the efficient application of force but with the exploitation of potential force [9, page 5].
a slightly divergent view is expounded by schelling when he states that strategy [.
on one view, the least one may expect of game theory is that it provides an answer to the question which actions maximize an agent"s expected utility in situations of interactive decision making.
