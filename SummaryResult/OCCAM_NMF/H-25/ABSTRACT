categories and subject descriptors h.3.3 [information search and retrieval]: retrieval models general terms algorithms 
they are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top.
our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback.
we propose a cluster-based method for  selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback.
with term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without  interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query expansion process.
in this paper we study term-based feedback for information  retrieval in the language modeling approach.
