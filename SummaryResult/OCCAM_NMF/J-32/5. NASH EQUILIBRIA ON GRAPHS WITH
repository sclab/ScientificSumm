the values for vi that may occur in a nash equilibrium are those for which all dependent vj values lie in (0, 1); the latter condition is easy to check by computing the image of the interval (0, 1) under respective fractional linear transforms. 
if the quadratic equation is trivial, there is potentially a  continuum of fully-mixed equilibria.
for an even-length  cycle, we obtain two quadratic equations, one for vi and another for 105 vi+1, and we can in the same way test whether any solutions to these yield values for the other vj , all of which lie in (0, 1).
for an odd-length cycle all other vj "s are derivable from those solutions, and if a fully mixed nash equilibrium exists, all the vj should turn out to be real numbers in the range (0, 1).
if the equation is non-trivial it has at most 2 solutions in (0, 1).
and ultimately vi itself to obtain a quadratic  equation (for vi) that is simple to derive from the payoffs in the game.
we can express vi in terms of vi+2, then vi+4, vi+6 etc.
choose any vertex vi.
for some new constants a0 , a1 , b0 , b1 .
composing the two linear fractional transforms, we obtain vi+3 = (a0 +a1 vi−1)/(b0 +b1 vi−1).
since all vertices in the cycle play mixed strategies, we have vi+3 = (a0 +a1vi+1)/(b0 +b1vi+1).
for the second search, note that if vi plays a mixed strategy, then vi+1 and vi−1 satisfy an equation of the form vi+1 = (a0 + a1vi−1)/(b0 + b1vi−1).
(otherwise, there is no nash equilibrium of the desired form.)
3. apply the upstream pass to p 4. put vi = b; apply the downstream pass for each vertex, vj, keep track of all possible mixed strategies vj 5. check whether vi+1 has any responses that are consistent with vi = b; if so we have a nash equilibrium.
, vi−1, vi) 2. let payoff to vi+1 be based on putting vi = b (so it depends only on vi+1 and vi+2.)

1. let p be the path (vi+1, vi+2 .
, k} and each b ∈ {0, 1}, do the following.
for each i ∈ {1, .
for i ≤ k let vi denote the probability that vi plays 1. the first search can be done as follows.
, vk (in cyclic order), we make two separate searches for a nash equilibrium: first we search for a nash equilibrium where some vertex plays a pure strategy, then we search for a fully mixed nash equilibrium, where all vertices play mixed strategies.
given a cycle with vertices v1, .
since each connected component can be  handled independently, to obtain a proof of theorem 2, we only need to show how to deal with cycles.
maximum degree 2 in this section we show how the algorithm for paths can be  applied to solve a game on any graph whose vertices have degree at most 2. a graph having maximum degree 2 is, of course, a union of paths and cycles.
