we  conclude with a discussion and suggest directions for future research in section 5. 
an equilibrium analysis and computational means for finding the equilibrium strategy are provided in section 3. in section 4 we  review related mas and economic search theory literature.
in the following section we formally present the s-dm model.
throughout the paper we demonstrate the different properties of the new model and compare it with the i-dm model using an artificial synthetic environment.
we manage to extract the agents" new equilibrium strategies without increasing the  computational complexity in comparison to the i-dm model.
of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).
this latter contribution is 2 the term costs refers to resources the agent needs to consume for  maintaining its search, such as: self advertisement, locating other agents,  communicating with them and processing their offers.
these are used for  supplying an appropriate computational means that facilitates the  calculation of the agents" equilibrium strategy.
finally, by using an  innovative recursive presentation of the acceptance probabilities of  different potential partnerships, we identify unique characteristics of the equilibrium strategies in the new model.
second, we prove that the agents"  sdm strategy weakly dominates the i-dm strategy, thus every agent has an incentive to deviate to the s-dm strategy when all other agents are using the i-dm strategy.
this model is a general search model which can be applied in various (not necessarily  software agents-based) domains.
the main contributions of this paper are threefold: first, we  formally model and analyze a two-sided search process in which the agents have no temporal decision making constraints concerning the rejection of or commitment to potential partnerships they  encounter in parallel (the s-dm model).
in the absence of other economic two-sided parallel search  models, we use the model that relies on an instantaneous (synchronous) decision making process [21] (denoted i-dm throughout the rest of the paper) as a benchmark for evaluating the usefulness of our proposed sequential (asynchronous) decision making strategy  (denoted s-dm).
the new model is a much more realistic pairwise model and, as we show in the analysis section, is always preferred by any single agents participating in the process.
this leads to a sequential decision making process by which each agent, upon sending a commit message to one of the other agents, delays its decision concerning a commitment or rejection of all other  potential partnerships until receiving a response from that agent (i.e., the agent still maintains parallel interactions in each search stage, except that its decision making process at the end of the stage is  sequential rather than instantaneous).
the asynchronous  approach allows the agents to re-evaluate their strategy, based on each new response they receive from the agents they interact with.
in our model, the agents are free to notify the other agents of their decisions in an asynchronous manner.
this inherent restriction imposes a significant limitation on the agents" strategic behavior.
thus each agent, upon reviewing the  opportunities available in a specific search stage, has to notify all other agents of its decision whether to commit to a partnership (at most with one of them) or reject the partnership (with the rest of them).
however, the agents in that seminal model are required to synchronize their  decision making process.
despite the advantages identified for parallel interactions in  adjacent domains (e.g., in one-sided economic search [7, 16]), a first  attempt for modeling a repeated pairwise matching process in which agents are capable of maintaining interaction with several other agents at a time was introduced only recently [21].
for example, the analysis of the costs associated with evaluating potential partnerships between service providers reveals both fixed and variable components when using the parallel search, thus the average cost per interaction  decreases as the number of parallel interactions increases [21].
such use of parallel interactions in search is favorable whenever the average cost2 per interaction with another agent, when interacting in parallel with a batch of other agents, is smaller than the cost of maintaining one  interaction at a time (i.e., advantage to size).
here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in  comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.
nevertheless, when the search is assigned to autonomous software agents a better search strategy can be used.
while the two-sided search literature offers comprehensive  equilibrium analysis for various models, it assumes that the agents" search is conducted in a purely sequential manner: each agent  locates and interacts with one other agent in its environment at a time 450 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas [5, 22].
furthermore, the equal utility scenario can also hold whenever there is an option for side-payments and the partnership"s overall utility is equally split among the two agents forming it [22].
in all these applications, any two agents can form a partnership and the performance of any given partnership depends on the skills or the characteristics of its members.
each of them enjoys the same reduced price).
other examples are the scenario where students need to form pairs for working together on an assignment, for which both partners share the same grade, and the scenario where two buyer agents interested in similar or  interchangeable products join forces to buy a product together, taking advantage of discount for quantity (i.e.
here the players are being rewarded completely based on the team"s (rather than the individual) performance.
for example,  consider tennis players that seek partners when playing doubles (or a canoe"s paddler looking for a partner to practice with).
the equal utility scenario is usually applicable in domains where the partners gain from the synergy between them.
in this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems, in which the performance of the partnership applies to both parties, i.e., both gain an equal utility [13].
when resuming the search, on the other hand, a more  suitable partner might be found however some resources will need to be consumed for maintaining the search process.
by forming a partnership the agents gain an immediate utility and terminate their search.
the  twosided nature of the search suggests that a partnership between a pair of agents is formed only if it is mutually accepted.
twosided agents-based search can also be found in applications of  buyers and sellers in emarkets and peer-to-peer applications.
for example, through a  twosided search, agents, representing different service providers, can exchange unused bandwidth [21] and communication satellites can transfer communication with a greater geographical coverage.
an exchange  mechanism is used in those cases where selling these resources is not the core business of the organization or when the overhead for  selling them makes it non-beneficial.
an important class of such applications includes secondary  markets for exchanging unexploited resources.
recent literature suggests various software agent-based applications where a two-sided distributed (i.e., with no centralized matching mechanisms) search takes place.
a typical market where this kind of two-sided search takes place is the marriage market [22].
the interaction does not involve bargaining thus each agent merely needs to choose  between accepting or rejecting the partnership with the other agent.
and the two interact bilaterally in order to learn the benefit  encapsulated in a partnership between them.
while ai search is an active process in which an agent finds a sequence of actions that will bring it from the initial state to a goal state, economic search refers to the identification of the best agent to commit to a partnership with.
a two-sided economic search is a distributed mechanism for forming agents" pairwise partnerships [5].1 on every stage of the process, each of the agents is randomly matched with another agent 1 notice that the concept of search here is very different from the classical definition of search in ai.
