• fully characterize the full-information nash equilibrium in first price auctions, and use this characterization to derive its overcharging compared to truthful mechaisms. 
in addition, if congestion affects the probability of  successful delivery, a sender with a lower cost alternate path may end up with a lower utility level than his rival with a higher cost alternate path.
the premium can be expressed as a function of the second-highest demand.
our preliminary results show that when several senders compete for a single transit node"s  capacity, the sender with the highest demand pays a premium even if transit costs are common knowledge.
• consider the effect of congestion and capacity constraints on the proposed mechanisms.
we plan to study under what mechanisms this strategy profile may emerge as a unique equilibrium (e.g., penalty by successor nodes).
• while the proposed payment schemes sustain cooperation in equilibrium, it is not a unique equilibrium.
• analyze the feasibility of recursive contracts under  hiddeninformation of transit costs.
our model and results suggest several natural and intriguing  research avenues: • consider manipulative or collusive behaviors which may arise under the proposed payment schemes.
in addition, in scenarios of unknown transit costs, it is also possible to design mechanisms that induce cooperative behavior in equilibrium, but the sender pays a premium for extracting information from the  transit nodes.
we  conclude that monitoring per-hop outcomes may not improve the  utility of the participants or the network performace.
directions in this paper we show that in a multi-hop routing setting, where the actions of the intermediate nodes are hidden from the source 125 and/or destination, it is possible to design payment schemes to  induce cooperative behavior from the intermediate nodes.
