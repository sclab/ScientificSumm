another approach is to have third parties like keynote independently monitor the network performance. 
one recent approach that can alleviate this problem is to provide packet obituaries by having each packet to confirm its delivery or report its last successful as hop [4].
with the realization that the  information collected may be used by the principal in subsequent  contractual relationships, the intermediate nodes may behave strategically, misrepresenting their true costs to the entities that collect and  aggregate such information.
however, the various proposals for acquiring network topology and performance information do not deal with strategic behavior by the intermediate nodes.
however, as we have shown in section 5, as long as each agent can chose the next hop, the principal can gain full benefit by  contracting with only the first hop (through the implementation of recursive contracts).
in this case, first-best contracts can be achieved through individual contracts with nodes along the path.
if information about topology and transit costs is obtained, the scenario is mapped to the known  transit costs model (section 3).
these proposals are quite different in nature, but they are common in their attempt to provide more visibility and transparency into the network.
yet another approach is to delegate the task of obtaining topology and  performance information to a third-party, like in the routing-as-a-service proposal [21].
another approach is to have the edge networks perform measurements and discover the network topology [32].
one approach to obtain such information is through end-to-end  probing [1].
recently, several new architectures have been proposed in the context of the internet to provide the principal not only with a set of paths from which it can chose (like bgp does) but also with the performance along those paths and the network topology.
in addition, the current protocol does not have the  infrastructure to support implementation of direct contracts between endpoints and the network.
such contracts involve paying some premium over the real cost, and it is not clear whether recursive contacts can be implemented in this scenario.
in this case, the principal (e.g., a multi-homed site or a tier-1 as) can implement one of the mechanisms proposed in section 4 by contracting with individual nodes on the path.
since the protocol reveals only the autonomous systems (as"s) along a route but not the cost associated to them, the current bgp routing is best characterized by lack of a priori information about transit costs.
border gateway protocol (bgp), the current inter-domain  routing protocol in the internet, computes routes based on path vectors.
we can map different deployed and proposed internet routing schemes to the various models we have considered in this work.
