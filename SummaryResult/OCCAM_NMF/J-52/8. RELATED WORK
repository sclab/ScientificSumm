[27] shows that this task is made possible when production takes place sequentially. 
[17] identifies the problem of moral hazard in production teams, and shows that it is impossible to design a  sharing rule which is efficient and budget-balanced.
the problem of information asymmetry and hidden-action (also known as moral hazard) is well studied in the economics  literature [11, 17, 23, 27].
security issues within this context, such as node authentication or  message encryption, are orthogonal to the problem presented in this paper, and can be found, for example, in [18, 19, 25].
like other works in this field, we assume that all the  accounting services are done using out-of-band mechanisms.
the focus of this work is the design of a payment scheme that provides the appropriate incentives within the context of multi-hop routing.
they start with the proposed  mechanism presented in [13] and use mostly auditing mechanisms to prevent deviation from the algorithm.
inducing desired behavior is also the objective in [26], which attempts to respond to the  challenge of distributed amd raised in [15]: if the same agents that seek to manipulate the system also run the mechanism, what  prevents them from deviating from the mechanism"s proposed rules to maximize their own welfare?
these works propose mechanisms to tackle the hidden-information problem, but ignore the problem of forwarding enforcement.
research in distributed algorithmic mechanism design (damd) has been applied to bgp routing [13, 14].
while such a framework can be used for the first task, we propose a different approach to the  second problem without the need of per-hop auditing information.
the accountability framework proposed in [4] can serve two main goals: informing nodes of network conditions to help them make informed decision, and helping entities to establish whether individual ass have  performed their duties adequately.
if senders have transit cost  information and can fully control the path of their packets, they can design contracts that yield them with first-best utility.
this proposal is part of a broader approach to provide end hosts with greater control over the path of their packets [3, 30].
in the context of internet routing, [4] proposes an accountability framework that provide end hosts and service providers  after-thefact audits on the fate of their packets.
we show that this type of per-hop monitoring may not be needed.
in their approach, nodes are supposed to send receipts to a  thirdparty entity.
[31] is the closest to our work in that it designs payment schemes in which the sender pays the  intermediate nodes in order to prevent several types of selfish behavior.
other approaches propose payment schemes [10, 20, 31] to encourage cooperation.
in order to mitigate selfish behavior, some approaches [7, 8, 9] require reputation exchange between nodes, or simply first-hand observations [5].
therefore, such a mechanism is not effective against selfish behavior.
however, rather than penalizing nodes that do not forward traffic, it bypasses the misbehaving nodes, thereby relieving their burden.
it  proposes to mitigate it by detection and report mechanisms that will essentially help to route around the malicious nodes.
[22] considers the problem of malicious behavior, where nodes respond positively to route requests but then fail to forward the actual packets.
the study of non-cooperative behavior in communication  networks, and the design of incentives, has received significant  attention in the context of wireless ad-hoc routing.
