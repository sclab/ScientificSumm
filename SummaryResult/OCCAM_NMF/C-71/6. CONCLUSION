this  demonstrates a good application of employing ι in coverage-related  problems. 
simulation results verify that mind outperforms a greedy  algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we design in terms of the number and the performance of the groups formed.
with an  algorithm called maximizing-ι node-deduction (mind), we show that maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good approach to solve this  problem.
we formulate a general sensor-grouping  problem for wsns and provide a general sensing model.
we set out to validate this idea by employing ι to a  sensorgrouping problem.
we propose that ι can serve as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points, which can be employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks (wsns).
we find that a set of points that achieve a maximum value of ι  result in a honeycomb structure.
ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points.
this paper proposes ι, a novel index for evaluation of  pointdistribution.
