this demonstrates a good application of employing ι in coverage-related problems for wsns.
simulation results verify that mind outperforms a greedy algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we design.
we show that locally maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good  approach to solve this problem with an algorithm called  maximizingι node-deduction (mind).
to validate this idea, we formulate a general  sensorgrouping problem for wsns and provide a general sensing model.
we propose that ι can serve as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points, which can be  employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks (wsns).
we find that a set of points that achieve a maximum value of ι result in a honeycomb structure.
ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points  normalized by the average distance between each pair of points.
we propose ι, a novel index for evaluation of point-distribution.
