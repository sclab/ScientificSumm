we make concluding remarks in section 7. 
section 6 gives our experimental results.
in section 4, we describe our method of title extraction, and in section 5, we describe our method of document retrieval using extracted titles.
in section 2, we introduce related work, and in section 3, we explain the motivation and problem setting of our work.
the rest of the paper is organized as follows.
we conclude that we can indeed conduct reliable title extraction from general documents and use the extracted results to improve real applications.
(3) we have found that using the extracted titles we can significantly improve precision of document retrieval (by 10%).
(2) we have empirically verified that the models trained with our approach are generic in the sense that they can be trained on one domain and applied to another, and they can be trained in one language and applied to another.
(1) we have observed that perceptron based models perform better in terms of extraction accuracies.
it turns out that the use of format features is the key to successful title extraction.
precision and recall for title extraction from word are 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from powerpoint are 0.875 and 0.895 respectively.
our method can significantly outperform the baselines: one that always uses the first lines as titles and the other that always uses the lines in the largest font sizes as titles.
experimental results indicate that our approach works well for title extraction from general documents.
(1) comparison between models: among the models above, which model performs best for title extraction; (2) generality of model: whether it is possible to train a model on one domain and apply it to another domain, and whether it is possible to train a model in one language and apply it to another language; (3) usefulness of extracted titles: whether extracted titles can improve document processing such as search.
in this paper, we also investigate the following three problems, which did not seem to have been examined previously.
we employ the following models: maximum entropy model, perceptron with uneven margins, maximum entropy markov model, and voted perceptron.
in the models, we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features.
we annotate titles in sample documents (for word and powerpoint respectively) and take them as training data to train several types of models, and perform title extraction using any one type of the trained models.
we take a machine learning approach.
as a case study, we consider extraction from office including word and powerpoint.
general documents can be in many different file formats: microsoft office, pdf (ps), etc.
as a case study, we consider title extraction in this paper.
there are many types of metadata: title, author, date of creation, etc.
it has not been clarified whether a machine learning based approach can work well for this task.
in contrast, the styles of general documents can vary greatly.
research papers usually have well-formed styles and noticeable characteristics.
general documents are more widely available in digital libraries, intranets and the internet, and thus investigation on extraction from them is sorely needed.
by general documents, we mean documents that may belong to any one of a number of specific genres.
they mainly used linguistic features in the model.1 in this paper, we consider metadata extraction from general documents.
they formalized the problem as that of classification and employed support vector machines as the classifier.
[10] proposed a machine learning based method to conduct extraction from research papers.
for instance, han et al.
however, the focus was mainly on extraction from research papers.
methods for performing the task have been proposed.
thus, how to automatically extract metadata from the bodies of documents turns out to be an important research issue.
however, people seldom define document metadata by themselves, even when they have convenient metadata definition tools [26].
ideally, metadata is defined by the authors of documents and is then used by various systems.
metadata of documents is useful for many kinds of document processing such as search, browsing, and filtering.
