to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on using extracted titles from general documents (e.g., office documents) for search of the documents.
zhang et al., found that web pages with well-defined metadata are more easily retrieved than those without well-defined metadata [24].
many search engines seem to utilize them for web page retrieval [7, 11, 18, 22].
in web search, the title fields (i.e., file properties) and anchor texts of web pages (html documents) can be viewed as â€˜titles" of the pages [5].
managed to extract titles from research papers and make use of the extracted titles in metadata search of papers [8].
in the system citeseer, for instance, giles et al.
2.3 search using title information title information is useful for document retrieval.
information extraction has been applied, for instance, to  part-ofspeech tagging [20], named entity recognition [25] and table extraction [19].
hidden markov model [6], maximum entropy model [1, 4], maximum entropy markov model [17], support vector machines [3], conditional random field [12], and voted perceptron [2] are widely used information extraction models.
2.2 information extraction metadata extraction can be viewed as an application of information extraction, in which given a sequence of instances, we identify a subsequence that represents information in which we are interested.
they reported high extraction accuracy from research papers in terms of precision and recall.
they mainly used linguistic information as features.
they viewed the problem as that of classifying the lines in a document into the categories of metadata and proposed using support vector machines as the classifier.
[10], for instance, conducted metadata extraction with the machine learning approach.
han et al.
it is less adaptive and robust when compared with the machine learning approach.
however, it also has disadvantages.
the rule-based approach can achieve high performance.
[16] also conducted automatic metadata extraction from research papers using rules on formatting information.
mao et al.
[23] performed metadata extraction from educational materials using rule-based natural language processing technologies.
[14] and yilmazel el al.
liddy et al.
they used rules like titles are usually located on the upper portions of the first pages and they are usually in the largest font sizes.
[9], for instance, developed a rule-based system for automatically extracting metadata from research papers in postscript.
giuffrida et al.
the proposed methods fall into two categories: the rule based approach and the machine learning based approach.
2.1 document metadata extraction methods have been proposed for performing automatic metadata extraction from documents; however, the main focus was on extraction from research papers.
