weight for content was 1.0, title was 10.0, anchor was 10.0, and extracted title was 5.0. 
∑= f ff dlwwdl in our experiments we used 75.0,8.11 == bk .
average document length in the corpus becomes the average of all weighted document lengths.
first, for each term in the query we count the term frequency in each field of the document; each field frequency is then weighted according to the corresponding weight parameter: ∑= f tfft tfwwtf similarly, we compute the document length as a weighted sum of lengths of each field.
as fields, we make use of body, title, extracted title and anchor.
in this paper, we employ a modification of bm25 that allows field weighting [21].
by doing this, we attempt to improve the overall precision.
as explained previously, our experiment has shown that a significant number of documents actually have incorrect titles in the file properties, and thus in addition of using them we use the extracted titles as one more field of the document.
also, titles are typically assigned high weights, indicating that they are important for document retrieval.
a ranking function in search can use different weights for different fields of 149 the document.
typically, in information retrieval a document is split into a number of fields including body, title, and anchor text.
we describe our method of document retrieval using extracted titles.
