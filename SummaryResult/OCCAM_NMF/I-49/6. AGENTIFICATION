it is the same for the evaluation of a proposal: each agent has to convert the information about the issues to update its private information and to obtain the values of each attribute of the decision criteria. 
when the issues and the  decision criteria are different from each other, the information about the criteria improvement have to be pre-processed to give some instructions on the directions to take and about the negotiated issues.
such agents are interchangeable, in a case of failure, since they all have the same properties and represent a user with his preference model, not depending on the agent, but on the model defined in myriad.
2. negotiator agent communication acts: (a) accept-proposal: sends a message to the  mediator agent containing the agent recommendations to improve the proposal and obtained with convert_improvements_wc; (b) reject-proposal: sends a message to the  mediator agent containing the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed and obtained with convert_no_decrease_wc.
(a) propose: sends a message containing a proposal to all negotiator agents; (b) inform: sends a message to all negotiator agents to inform them that an agreement has been  reached and containing the consensus outcome.

1. mediator agent communication acts: 946 the sixth intl.
in addition to these behaviours, the communication acts between the agents is as follows.
this model has to be part of the agent so that it could be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the  improvements.
the main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_improvements: converts the information  given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done, into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • convert_no_decrease: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal  according to the constraints obtained with  convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent  preferences; the main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a myriad option of the agent according to its preferences model and its private data; • convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent  recommendations for the improvements of a myriad  option into general information on the proposal; • convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent  recommendations about the criteria that should not be  changed in the myriad option into general information on the proposal; in addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types of agents, access behaviours to myriad functionalities such as the evaluation and improvement functions: • evaluate_option: evaluates the myriad option  obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal; • improvements: gets the agent recommendations to  improve a proposal from the myriad option; • no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not change some criteria from the myriad option; of course, before running the system with such agents, we must have defined each party preferences model in  myriad.
in fact, there are two types of agents: the mediator type for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our  negotiation protocol, the delegated physician in our application, and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to the other parties, the hospitals.
each agent has private information and can access public information as knowledge.
moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal evaluated and analysed using myriad.
these agents are: • autonomous: they decide for themselves what, when and under what conditions actions should be  performed; • rational: they have a means-ends competence to fit its decisions, according to its knowledge, preferences and goal; • self-interested: they have their own interests which may conflict with the interests of other agents.
the agents have the involved parties" information and preferences.
first of all, it seems obvious that there should be one agent for each player of our multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.
however, for this negotiation application, the modelling is quite natural when one observes the negotiation protocol motivations and main properties.
therefore, in this section, we describe the elements and constraints taken into account during the modelling phase and for the model itself.
the agentification has an influence upon the systems efficiency in solving the problem.
how the problem is transposed in a mas problem is a very important aspect when designing such a system.
