this recommendation is very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while not revealing their own preference model. 
the agent is then recommended to improve of coalition c for which ωc (hk, x) is maximum.
the expression of ωc (hk, x) when hk is a choquet integral, is given in [11].
we generally assume that ec is of order 1, that is ec (τ, x) = τ p i∈c (1 − xi).
function ωc (hk, x) depicts the  average improvement of hk when the criteria of coalition a range from xc to 1c divided by the average effort needed for this improvement.
hk on some criteria c ⊆ nk as follows ωc (hk, x)= z 1 0 hk ` (1 − τ)xc + τ, xnk\c ´ − hk(x) ec (τ, x) dτ where ((1−τ)xc +τ, xnk\c ) is the compound act that equals (1 − τ)xi + τ if i ∈ c and equals xi if i ∈ nk \ c. moreover, ec (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xc + τ, xnk\c ).
the score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j. in myriad, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωc (h, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t.
in other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts  substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].
hence, the lower score of z on criterion i  conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones.
a positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].
assume that zi < zj.

the two-additive choquet integral is defined for (z1, .
the overall preference relation over xk is then x y ⇐⇒ uk(x) ≥ uk(y) .

an option x is identified to an element of xk = xk 1 × · · · × xk nk , with x = (x1, .
the [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes.
all the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the  introduction of partial utility functions uk i : xk i → [0, 1].

the set of the attributes of nk is denoted by xk 1 , .
in order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria  decision aiding (mcda) tool named myriad [12] developed at thales for mcda applications based on a two-additive choquet integral which is a good compromise between  versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].
these issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.
