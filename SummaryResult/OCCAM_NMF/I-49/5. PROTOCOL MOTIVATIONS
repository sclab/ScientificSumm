1 what can also help in reducing the communication time. 
each party in a negotiation n, a  negotiator, can also be a mediator of another negotiation n , this party becoming the representative of n in the negotiation n, as illustrated by fig.
traffic state, transport mode and time).
this mediator can also be considered as the representative of the general interest we can have, in some applications, such as in the crisis management problem, the physician will be the mediator and will also have some more information to consider when making an offer (e.g.
their availabilities) and the recommendations they make.
this specific entity is in charge of making the proposals to the other parties in the system by taking into account their public constraints (e.g.
in order to facilitate and speed up the negotiation, we introduce a mediator.
therefore, when one of the parties refuses an offer, some information will be  communicated.
we are in a cooperative context and revealing one"s  opinion on what can be improved is not prohibited, on the  contrary, it is useful and recommended here seeing that it helps in converging on an agreement.
the parties to make a new proposal.

joint conf.
thus, all  information is a constraint to be satisfied as much as possible by the sixth intl.
we also consider that the dual function can be used to take into account another type of information: on which criteria of a proposal, no  improvement is necessary so that the overall evaluation of a proposal is still acceptable, do not decrease.
as we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the  information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals.
in particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11].
myriad provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a  proposal.
in particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted.
some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed.
the use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution.
in the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.
in fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal  using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.
this penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus  procedure.
this incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold.
we decided to introduce in the negotiation protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time.
the negotiation has also to converge quickly on an  unanimous agreement.
at the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its  maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted.
to this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the  parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it.
moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic.
this makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.
a consensus achieved.
in addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e.
we have to consider that all the parties of the  negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an  unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.
thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the  overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria.
when the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain  simultaneously over all issues [5].
for multi-issue problems, there are two approaches: a complete package approach where the issues are  negotiated simultaneously in opposition to the sequential approach where the issues are negotiated one by one.
