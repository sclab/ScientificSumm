therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the  dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport  constraints and availabilities. 
in the case of the 11 march 2004 madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the  appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport  constraints and, in particular, the traffic.
in this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and  classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.
the physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the  evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.
the emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.
nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.
the  evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.
for all victims, a sorter physician -  generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.
then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.
first, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.
when a victim is found, several actions follow.
these plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.
for disasters, master plans are executed.
when a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational  preparedness activity are executed.
in this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.
the management of declared crisis is the response to - including the  evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the community"s systems back to normal.
the operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to  ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of  resources to deal with possible emergencies.
the crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the  crisis actually happens.
crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis  prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.
this protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.
