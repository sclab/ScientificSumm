it is a mistake to overlook this technology with such a high payback.
today, it would be difficult to identify an application with as high a return on investment as grid computing in information technology divisions in higher education institutions.
the potential benefits of grid computing are colossal in higher education learning while the implementation costs are low.
simply, the grid computing is up and coming.
sap [14] is piloting a project to grid-enable sap erp applications, dell [15] has partnered with platform computing to consolidate computing resources and provide grid-enabled systems for compute intensive applications, oracle has integrated support for grid computing in their 10g release [16], united devices [17] offers hosting service for  gridon-demand, and sun microsystems continues their research and development of sun"s n1 grid engine [18] which combines grid and clustering platforms.
there is an assortment of new grid players in the it world expanding the grid computing model and advancing the grid technology to the next level.
the national virtual collaboratory grid project [13] will link earthquake researchers across the u.s. with computing resources, allowing them to share extremely large data sets, research equipment, and work together as virtual teams over the internet.
although in our campuses we discourage students from utilizing peer-to-peer applications from music sharing, the same protocol can be utilized on applications such as decision support and data mining.
for instance, peer-to-peer applications such as kazaa, are based on storage grids that do not share processing power but instead an elegant protocol to swap files between systems.
recently, the it industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous types of contemporary grid applications in addition to the traditional grid framework for compute intensive applications.
grid computing continues to advance.
