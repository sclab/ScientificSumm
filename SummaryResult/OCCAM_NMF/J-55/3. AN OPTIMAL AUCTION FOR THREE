finding a simple restriction on the form of n-bidder auctions for n > 3 under which the optimal auction can be found analytically as above remains an open problem. 
the proof of its optimality validates its proposed form.
the feasibility problem which arises from the linear optimization problem by assuming the constraints are tight is as follows: a(y) + a(x) + xb(x) + y x zg(z)dz = r max(3, 2x) ∀x < y a(x) + b(x) + ∞ x g(z)dz = 1 a(x) ≥ 0 b(x) ≥ 0 g(z) ≥ 0 solving this feasibility problem gives the auction υ3 proposed above.
this motivates considering symmetric scale-invariant auctions for three bidders with probability density function, ρ1,x(z), of the following form: ρ1,x(z) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 with discrete probability a(x) x with discrete probability b(x) z with probability density g(z) for z > x in this auction, the sale price for the first bidder is either one of the latter two bids, or higher than either bid with a probability density which is independent of the input.
in section 6 we show that the optimal auction must sometimes place probability mass on sale prices above the highest bid.
if the solution to these equations has value matching the lower bound obtained from the worst-case  distribution, then this solution is the optimal auction and that our  conjectured choice of worst-case distribution is correct.
the guess that these constraints are tight allows us to transform the optimization problem into a feasibility problem constrained by differential equations.
in the optimal two-bidder auction, all inputs with non-identical bids are worst-case, so we will assume the same for three bidders.
since this distribution has full support over the set of all bid vectors and a worst-case distribution puts positive probability only on worst-case inputs, we can therefore assume that all but a  measure zero set of inputs is worst-case for the optimal auction.
we guess (and later verify) that this distribution is the worst-case input distribution for three bidders as well.
for two bidders, this bid distribution is the worst-case input distribution.
as we discuss in section 2.4, in [8], the authors define a  distribution and use it to find a lower bound on the competitive ratio of the optimal auction.
however, by guessing which constraints are tight and which are slack at the optimum, we will be able to derive a set of differential equations for which any feasible solution is an optimal auction.
the optimal auction for the finite auction problem can be found by the following optimization problem in which the variables are ρb-i (z): maximize r subject to n i=1 bi z=1 zρb-i (z)dz ≥ rf(2) (b) ∞ z=1 ρb-i (z)dz = 1 ρb-i (z) ≥ 0 this set of integral inequalities is difficult to maximize over.
a truthful, randomized auction on n bidders can be represented by a randomized function f : rn−1 × n → r that maps masked bid vectors to prices in r. by normalization, we can assume that the lowest possible bid is 1. recall that ρb-i (z) = pr[f(b-i) = z].
by applying this consequence, we will derive an optimal auction for three bidders.
motivation for υ3 in this section, we will conjecture that a particular input distribution is worst-case, and show, as a consequence, that all inputs are  worstcase in the optimal auction.
if any of the inequalities 1 ≤ x ≤ y are not strict, the same proof applies giving a lower bound on the auction"s profit; however, this bound may no longer be tight.
note that the fraction of f(2) raised on every input is identical.
the final equation comes from substituting in g(x) = 2/13 (x−1)3 and expanding the integrals.
consider the revenue raised from all three bidders: e[υ3(b)] = p(1, x, y) + p(x, 1, y) + p(y, 1, x) = 0 + 9/13 − y 3/2 zg(z)dz + 9/13 − x 3/2 zg(z)dz + x x 3/2 (z + 1)g(z)dz + y x zg(z)dz = 18/13 + (x − 2) x 3/2 zg(z)dz + x x 3/2 g(z)dz = 12x/13.
the auction must raise expected revenue of at least 12x/13 on these bids.
case 3 (3/2 < x ≤ y): f(2) = 2x.
therefore υ3 raises 18/13 on these bids.
the  bidder with valuation y will pay 9/13 + y 3/2 zg(z)dz in expectation.
the bidder with 177 valuation x will pay 9/13 − y 3/2 zg(z)dz in expectation.
case 2 (x ≤ 3/2 < y): f(2) = 3. the auction must raise  expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids.
the bidder with valuation x will pay 1 with 9/13, and the bidder with valuation y will pay 1 with probability 9/13.
case 1 (x < y ≤ 3/2): f(2) = 3. the auction must raise expected revenue of at least 18/13 on these bids.
consider the bids 1, x, y, with 1 < x < y. there are three cases.
furthermore, the auction raises exactly 6 13 f(2) on every input with non-identical bids.
theorem 3. the υ3 auction has a competitive ratio of 13/6 ≈ 2.17, which is optimal.
definition 5. υ3 is scale-invariant and symmetric and given by the bid-independent function with density function ρ1,x(z) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ for x ≤ 3/2 1 with probability 9/13 z with probability density g(z) for z > 3/2 for x > 3/2⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 with probability 9/13 − x 3/2 zg(z)dz x with probability x 3/2 (z + 1)g(z)dz z with probability density g(z) for z > x where g(x) = 2/13 (x−1)3 .
we follow the definition and proof with a discussion of how this auction was derived.
bidders in this section we define the optimal auction for three bidders, υ3, and prove that it indeed matches the known lower bound of 13/6.
