furthermore, we strongly suspect that for any number of bidders, the form of the optimal auction will be independent of the benchmark used. 
note that the form of υs,t 3 is essentially the same as for υ3, but that the probability of each price is scaled depending on the values of s and t. that our auction for three bidders matches the lower bound  computed by the input distribution used in [8] is strong evidence that this input distribution is the worst-case input distribution for any number of bidders and any generalized profit benchmark.
the auction is optimal  because it matches the lower bound found above.
this auction, like υ3, can be derived by reducing the optimization problem to a feasibility problem, guessing that the optimal solution has the same form as υs,t 3 , and solving.
theorem 5. υs,t 3 is s2 +t2 2t -competitive with gs,t.
definition 6. υs,t 3 is scale-invariant and symmetric and given by the bid-independent function with density function ρ1,x(z) = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ for x ≤ t s 1 with probability t2 s2+t2 z with probability density g(z) for z > t s for x > t s⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 1 with probability t2 s2+t2 − x t s zg(z)dz x with probability x t s (z + 1)g(z)dz z with probability density g(z) for z > x where g(x) = 2(t−s)2 /(s2 +t2 ) (x−1)3 .
similarly, we can find the optimal auction against gs,t using the same technique we used to solve for the three bidder auction with the best competitive ratio against f(2) .
the proof can be found in the appendix.
theorem 4. the optimal three-bidder auction, υs,t 3 ,  competing against gs,t(b) = max(sb(2), tb(3)) has a competitive ratio of at least s2 +t2 2t .
we denote the optimal auction for three bidders against gs,t as υs,t 3 .
evaluating the performance of any auction competing against gs,t on this distribution will yield the following theorem.
we can lower bound the competitive ratio of υs,t 3 using the same worst-case distribution from [8] that we used against f(2) .
as before, we will first find a lower bound on the competitive ratio and then design an auction to meet that bound.
178 competing with gs we will now design a three-bidder auction υs,t 3 that achieves the optimal competitive ratio against gs,t.
2 recall that the k-vickrey auction sells a unit to each of the  highest k bidders at a price equal to the k + 1st highest bid, b(k+1), achieving a profit of kb(k+1).
note that f(2) is the special case of gs with si = i, and that v∗ = gs with si = i − 1.
when considering gs we assume without loss of generality that si < si+1 as otherwise the constraint imposed by si+1 is irrelevant.
, sn) and defined as: gs(b) = max 2≤k≤n skb(k).
we can generalize this definition to gs, parameterized by s = (s2, .
recall that f(2) (b) = max2≥k≥n kb(k).
for instance, one might wish to  compete against v∗ , the profit of the k-vickrey auction with  optimal-inhindsight choice of k.2 alternatively, if an auction is being used as a subroutine in a larger mechanism, one might wish to choose the auction which is optimally competitive with a benchmark specific to that purpose.
however, it is reasonable to consider other benchmarks.
previous work in competitive analysis of auctions has focused on the question of designing the auction with the best competitive  ratio against f(2) , the profit of the optimal omniscient single-priced mechanism that sells at least two items.
this  results strongly corroborates the worst-case competitive analysis of auctions by showing that our techniques allow us to derive auctions which are competitive against a broad variety of reasonable  benchmarks rather than simply against f(2) .
we will show that, for three bidders, the form of the optimal auction is essentially independent of the benchmark profit used.
in this section, we widen our focus beyond auctions that compete with f(2) to consider other benchmarks for an auction"s profit.
