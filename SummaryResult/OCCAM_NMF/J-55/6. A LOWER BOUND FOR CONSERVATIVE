the theorem follows. 
, 1, kh, h) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1 n−1 + k > 1. but this is a contradiction, so 3nr−2r−n n−1 ≤ 0. thus, r ≤ n 3n−2 .
suppose 3nr−2r−n n−1 = > 0. let k = 1/ , h ≥ kh, and h n. by lemma 1, pr[f(1, .
let a be a conservative auction.
given lemma 1, theorem 10 is simple to prove.
, 1, kh, h) must be at least nr−1 n−1 + k(3nr−2r−n n−1 ).
therefore, the probability that the sale price will be no more than kh on masked bid vector on bid vector b = (1, .
in order to  satisfy our lower bound, (4), on phk (b), it must put at least 3nr−2r−n n−1 on hk.
this gives ρhk (b) with nr−1 n−1 probability at 1 and exactly 3nr−2r−n n−1 at each hi for 1 ≤ i < k. thus, the profit from offering prices at most hk−1 is nr−1 n−1 −kh(k−1)3nr−2r−n n−1 .
to  minimize the constraints implied by the strong inductive hypothesis, we place the minimal amount of probability mass required each price level.
(4) in order to lower bound pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ kh], consider the auction that minimizes it and is consistent with the lower bounds obtained by the strong inductive hypothesis on pr[f(b-hk ) ≤ ih].
given upper-bounds on the profit from the h-valued, equation bid (3), and the 1-valued bids, the profit from the hk-valued bid must be at least: phk (b) ≥ 2rkh − (n − 2)p1(b) − ph(b) ≥ kh 2r − n(1 − r) n − 1 + (k − 1) 2 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 − o(n).
next, we will find a lower bound on phk (b) by considering the revenue raised by the bids b. recall that a must obtain a profit of at least rf(2) (b) = 2rkh.
(3) equation (1) follows from the conservatism of a and (2) is from invoking the strong inductive hypothesis with h = kh and the observation that the maximum possible revenue will be found by placing exactly enough probability at each multiple of h to satisfy the constraints of the inductive hypothesis and placing the  remaining probability at kh.
first, we will find an upper bound on ph(b) ph (b) = 1 0 xρb-h (x)dx + k i=1 hi hi−1 xρb-h (x)dx (1) ≤ 1 + k i=1 hi hi hi−1 ρb-h (x)dx ≤ 1 + 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 k−1 i=1 ih + kh 1 − nr − 1 n − 1 − (k − 1) 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 (2) = kh n(1 − r) n − 1 + (k − 1) 2 3nr − 2r − n n − 1 + 1.
, 1, hk, h).
inductive case (k > 0, hk = kh): let b = (1, .
the base case follows trivially from the final  inequality.
, 1, 1, h): rn ≤ ph (b) + (n − 1)p1(b) = 1 + (n − 1) 1 0 xρb-1 (x)dx ≤ 1 + (n − 1) 1 0 ρb-1 (x)dx the second inequality follows from the conservatism of the  underlying auction.
base case (k = 0, hk = 1): a must raise revenue of at least rn on b = (1, .
we will also let p1(b), phk (b), and ph (b) represent the expected payment of a 1-valued, hk-valued, and h-valued bidder in a on b, respectively (note by symmetry the expected payment for all 1-valued bidders is the same).

similarly we notate b-hk (resp.
since we can assume without loss of generality that the auction is symmetric, we will notate b-1 as b with any one of the 1-valued bids masked.
, 1, hk, h) and placing bounds on ρb-i (z).
for any particular k and h we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, .
the lemma is proved by strong induction on k. first some notation that will be convenient.
, 1, h) ≤ hk] ≥ nr−1 n−1 + k(3nr−2r−n n−1 ).
then, for all k and h ≥ kh, pr[f(1, 1, .
let h n. let h0 = 1 and hk = kh  otherwise.
we will prove theorem 10 with the aid of the following lemma: lemma 1. let a be a conservative auction with competitive ratio 1/r for n bidders.
the class of conservative auctions can be viewed as a  generalization of the class of restricted auctions and therefore our result below gives lower bounds on the performance of a broader class of auctions.
in [8], the authors define a restricted auction as one on which, for any input, the sale prices are drawn from the set of input bid values.
the random sampling profit extraction auction [5] and the core auction [7], on the other hand, use the profitextractr mechanism as a subroutine and thus  sometimes offer a sale price which is higher than the highest input bid value.
the k-vickrey auction and the random sampling optimal price auction [9] are conservative auctions.
for the three-bidder case, υ3 has competitive ratio 2.17, while the best conservative auction is no better than 2.33-competitive.
for larger numbers of bidders, however, the restriction to conservative  auctions does affect the competitive ratio.
υ2, the 1-unit vickrey auction, is conservative.
for a two-bidder auction, this restriction does not prevent  optimality.
corollary 1. the competitive ratio of any conservative  auction for an arbitrary number of bidders is at least three.
then the competitive ratio of a is at least 3n−2 n .
theorem 10. let a be a conservative auction for n bidders.
we can now state our lower bound for conservative auctions.
definition 8. we say an auction bif is conservative if its  bidindependent function f satisfies f(b-i) ≤ max(b-i).
specifically, this result partially explains the form of the optimal three bidder auction.
as this 180 lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of theorem 2 for n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge a sales price higher than any bid in the input.
auctions in this section, we define a class of auctions that never offer a sale price which is higher than any bid in the input and prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of these auctions.
