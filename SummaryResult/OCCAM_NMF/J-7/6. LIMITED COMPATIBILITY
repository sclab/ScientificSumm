from here, it is not hard to show that a spreads directly throughout the entire network. 
however, once these nodes have adopted b, the best-response for each node of the form u(1, y) is a (a generates a payoff of 4 where as b only generates a payoff of 3.95).
however, now suppose we increase the coordination term, setting qbc = 0.9. this is not an equilibrium, since each node of the form u(0, y) now has an incentive to switch from c (generating a payoff of 3.9) to b (thereby generating a payoff of 3.95).
let qa = 3.95, qb = 1.25, qc = 1, and qbc = 0. it is easily verified that for these values, the initial configuration given above is an  equilibrium.
we now define the parameters of this game as follows.
add an edge between u(1, y) and v(y) for all y. for this  network, we consider the initial configuration in which all v(y) nodes select a, and node u(x, y) selects b if x < 0 and selects c  otherwise.
example 6.4. consider the union of an infinite two-dimensional grid graph with nodes u(x, y) and an infinite line graph with nodes v(y).
surprisingly, however, there are also instances in which compatibility is in fact harmful to both parties; the next example considers a fixed initial configuration with technologies a, b and c that is at  equilibrium when qbc = 0. however, if this compatibility term is  increased sufficiently, equilibrium is lost, and a becomes epidemic.
entry (x, y) in row i, column j indicates that the row player gets a payoff of x and the column player gets a payoff of y when the row player plays strategy i and the column player plays strategy j. there are cases when increased compatibility between two  technologies helps one technology at the expense of the other.
as one might expect, 82 a b ab a (1 − q; 1 − q) (x; x) (1 − q; 1 − q − r) b (x; x) (q; q) (q; q − r) ab (1 − q − r; 1 − q) (q − r; q) (max(q, 1 − q) − r; max(q, 1 − q) − r) table 1: the payoffs in the coordination game.
the above theorem shows that two technologies may both be able to survive the introduction of a new technology by increasing their level of compatibility with each other.
the second claim follows from the first and the observation that the alternating rows contain any plausible epidemic from growing vertically.
the first, third, and fourth claims in the theorem can be verified by checking the corresponding inequalities.
let qa = 4k2 + 4k + 1/2, qb = 2k + 2, qc = 2k + 1, and qbc = 2k + 3/4.
the initial state s assigns strategy b to even rows and strategy c to odd rows.
given δ, define g by starting with an infinite grid and connecting each node to its nearest δ − 2 neighbors that are in the same row.
theorem 6.3. for any even δ ≥ 12, there is a δ-regular graph g, an initial state s, and values qa, qb, qc , and qbc , such that • s is an equilibrium in both (g, qa, qb, qc , 0) and (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ), • neither b nor c can become epidemic in either (g, qa, qb, qc , 0) or (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ) starting from state s, • a can become epidemic (g, qa, qb, qc , 0) starting from state s, and • a can not become epidemic in (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ) starting from state s. proof.
(sketch.)
finally, we  consider a compatibility parameter qbc that represents the payoffs to two adjacent nodes when one selects b and the other selects c. thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters (g, qa, qb, qc , qbc ).
we also assume that r, the cost of selecting additional technologies, is sufficiently large so as to ensure that nodes never adopt more than one technology.
we will assume qa > qb > qc .
by a stable state, we mean that no finite  perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either b or c. we also have a technology a that is superior to both b and c, and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose a. however, by increasing their compatibility, b and c can maintain their stability and resist an epidemic from a. let qa denote the payoffs to two adjacent nodes that both choose technology a, and define qb and qc analogously.
we first present a theorem stating that for any even δ, there is a contagion game on a δ−regular graph in which the two  incumbent technologies b and c may find it beneficial to increase their compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new  superior technology a. in particular, we consider a situation in which initially, two technologies b and c with zero compatibility are at a stable state.
the  basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies b and c are initially coexisting, and a third technology a, superior to both, is introduced initially at a finite set of nodes.
here we indicate some of the technical issues that come up with multiple technologies, through a series of initial results.
given the complex structure  inherent in contagion games with two technologies, the understanding of contagion games with three or more technologies is largely open.
we know that for any v ∈ sab, q dsb (v) > r δ. thus qdsb (v) > (q − x)dsb (v) = q (1 − 2x)dsb (v) > r (1 − 2x)δ = rδ, as required for a blocking structure in g. similarly, the two  blocking structure constraints for v ∈ sb are only strengthened when we move from g to g. more than two technologies.
consider a blocking structure (sb, sab) for g .
we have that g is  equivalent to a game without compatibility parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x).
we will show that any blocking structure in g is also a blocking structure in g. by our characterization theorem,  theorem 4.6, this implies the desired result.
let g be that same game, but with an added symmetric compatibility term x. if a is epidemic for g, then a is epidemic for g .
theorem 6.2. let g be a game without compatibility,  parameterized by r and q on a particular network.
we now show that generally, if a is the superior technology (i.e., q < 1/2), adding a compatibility term x can only help a spread.
since q < 1/2 and q < 2r , a is epidemic in this game, and thus also in the game with limited compatibility.
however, if we insert symmetric off-diagonal payoffs x = 1/4, we have a new game, equivalent to a game parameterized by r = 5/16 and q = 1/4.
in this case, a is not epidemic, as can be seen by examining figure 1, since 2r < q and q + r > 1/2.
example 6.1. consider the contagion game played on a thick line graph (see section 3) with r = 5/32 and q = 3/8.
as the  following example shows, increasing compatibility between two  technologies can allow one technology that was not initially epidemic to become so.
nevertheless, we can still ask how the addition of an off-diagonal entry might affect the outcome of any particular game.
table 1 represents the payoffs in the coordination game in terms of these parameters.
thus the addition of symmetric off-diagonal entries does not  expand the class of games being considered.
as can be seen by examining table 1, the resulting payoffs are exactly those of a game without off-diagonal entries, parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x).
given a game with off-diagonal entries parameterized by q, r and x, consider subtracting x from all payoffs, and scaling up by a factor of 1/(1 − 2x).
we can model this using a variable xab representing the payoff gathered by an agent with technology a when her  neighbor has technology b, and similarly, a variable xba representing the payoff gathered by an agent with b when her neighbor has a. here we consider the special case in which these off-diagonal  entries are symmetric, i.e., xab = xba = x. we also assume that x < q ≤ 1 − q. we first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is  equivalent to a game without these entries, under a simple re-scaling of q and r. note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive or a multiplicative constant, the behavior of the game is unaffected.
a natural relaxation of the two-technology model is to introduce (small) positive payoffs for a-b interaction; that is, cross-technology communication yields some lesser value to both agents.
two technologies.
we then consider extensions to three technologies, identifying situations in which two coexisting incumbent technologies may or may not want to increases their mutual compatibility in the face of a new, third technology.
we find that this is 81 in fact no more general than the model with zero payoffs for a-b interactions.
we first consider two technologies, as in the previous sections, and introduce off-diagonal payoffs to capture a positive benefit in direct a-b interactions.
we now consider some further ways of modeling compatibility and interoperability.
