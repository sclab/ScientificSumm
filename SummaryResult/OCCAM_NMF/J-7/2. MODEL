in fact, we will show in section 4 that if a can become an epidemic in a game, then for every schedule of best-response moves of the nodes in v (g) \ t in which each node is scheduled an infinite number of times, eventually all nodes adopt strategy a.3 
definition 2.2. for t ⊆ v (g), we denote by st the strategy profile that assigns a to every agent in t and b to every agent in v (g) \ t. we say that technology a can become an epidemic in the game (g, q, r) if there is a finite set t of nodes in g (called the seed set) and a sequence s of vertices in v (g) \ t (where each vertex can appear more than once) such that st s → sv (g), i.e., endowing agents in t with technology a and letting other agents play their best response according to schedule s would lead every agent to eventually adopt strategy a.2 the above definition requires that the all-a equilibrium be  reachable from the initial state by at least one schedule s of best-response moves.
we say s s → s for two states s and s if for every vertex v ∈ v (g) there exists a k0(v) such that for every k > k0(v), s sk → sk for a state sk with sk(v) = s (v).
, vk by sk.
of vertices of g, we denote the subsequence v1, v2, .
for an infinite sequence s = v1, v2, .
, sk−1 such that s v1 → s1 v2 → s2 v3 → · · · sk−1 vk → s .
, vk of vertices of g (where vi"s are not necessarily distinct), we say s s → s if there is a sequence of states s1, .
similarly, for two states s and s and a finite sequence s = v1, v2, .
for two states s and s and a vertex v ∈ v (g), if starting from state s and letting v play her best-response move (breaking ties in favor of a and then ab) we get to the state s , we write s v → s .
a state in this game is a strategy profile s : v (g) → {a, b, ab}.
definition 2.1. consider a contagion game (g, q, r).
we provide a formal description of this question via the  following two definitions.
as discussed in the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know whether it is possible to move from an all-b equilibrium to an all-a equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents, and following a sequence of best-response moves.
in particular, the two states where everybody uses technology a or everybody uses technology b are both equilibria of this game.
this game can have many nash equilibria.
we refer to the overall game, played by all nodes in g, as a contagion game, and denote it using the tuple (g, q, r).
the overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0 if v chooses a or b and c = rδ if she chooses ab.
for edge (v, w), the payoff 77 to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy a and the other chooses strategy b; 1 − q if one chooses strategy a and the other chooses either a or ab; q if one chooses strategy b and the other chooses either b or ab; and max(q, 1 − q) if both choose strategy ab.
recall that we have an infinite δ-regular graph g, and strategies a, b, and ab that are used in a coordination game on each edge.
we now develop some further notation and definitions that will be useful for expressing the model.
