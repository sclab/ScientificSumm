this contradicts the assumption that u is playing her best response by switching to a. 
thus, the payoff of u for strategy a is (1 − q)za < δ/4 whereas her payoff for strategy ab is (1−q)za +qzb −c > δ/2−q ≥ δ/4.
as nab is constant and a is epidemic, it must be that nab = 0. thus, the only moves involve a node u switching from strategy b to strategy a. in order for xa,b to be constant for such moves, it must be that za (the number of neighbors of u in a) equals zb (the number of neighbors of u in b) and, as nab = 0, we have that za = zb = δ/2.
suppose a is epidemic in this region.
as c is irrational and the  remaining terms are always rational, both nab and xa,b must remain constant for the potential function as a whole to remain constant.
we have shown the potential function is non-increasing for our choice of q and c. this implies the potential function is eventually constant.
substituting our choice of parameters, it is easy to see that the term inside the floor is at most zb + 1/4, and so the floor is at most zb as zb is an integer.
by inequality 4 and the fact that za is an integer, za ≥  qzb 1 − q + (1 − 2q)zab 1 − q .
(4) such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of q(zb − za) as za edges are removed and zb edges are added to the xa,b edges between a and b. this change will be negative so long as zb < za.
in order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zab ≥ qzb − (1 − q)za.
this change will be non-positive so long as zb ≤ c/q, which holds by inequality 3. case 3: b → a. note u"s payoff with strategy b is q(zab + zb) whereas his payoff with strategy a is (1 − q)(zab + za).
in order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that qzb ≤ c. (3) such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the  potential function of qzb −c as zb edges are added to the xa,b edges between a and b and the size of partition piece ab is decreased by one.
case 2: ab → a. recalling that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategy ab is (1 − q)(zab + za) + qzb − c whereas her payoff with strategy a is (1 − q)(zab + za).
substituting our choice of parameters, (and noting that q ∈ [1/4, 1/2] and zab ≤ δ), we see that the term inside the ceiling is less than 1 and at least 3/64 3/4 − 1/32 1/2 > 0. thus, the ceiling is one, which is larger than c/q.
by inequality 2 and the fact that za is an integer, za ≥ ‰ c 1 − q − (1 − 2q)zab 1 − q ı .
this change will be  nonpositive so long as za ≥ c/q.
recalling that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategy b is q(zab + zb) whereas his payoff with strategy ab is (1 − q)(zab + za) + qzb − c. in order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − 2q)zab + (1 − q)za ≥ c. (2) now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qza + c as za edges are removed from the xa,b edges between a and b and the size of partition piece ab is increased by one.
case 1: b → ab.
specifically, let q = 1 2 − 1 64δ and c = rδ = α, where α is any irrational number strictly between 3/64 and q. again, there are three cases corresponding to the three possible strategy changes for a node u. let zab, za, and zb denote the number of neighbors of node u in partition piece ab, a, and b respectively.
we first show that if q is close enough to 1/2 and r is chosen  appropriately, this potential function is non-increasing.
the proof is based on the potential function from  theorem 5.1: qxa,b + cnab.
theorem 5.2. there exist q < 1/2 and r such that for every contagion game (g, q, r), a cannot become epidemic.
this means that there is a setting of the  parameters q and r for which the new technology a is superior, but for which the incumbent technology is guaranteed to survive regardless of the underlying network.
this next theorem shows that for any δ, there is a point (q, r) ∈ ω for which q < 1 2 .
, δ}), this change is bounded away from zero.
furthermore, as za can take only finitely many values (za ∈ {0, 1, .
this change will be  negative so long as za > c/q which holds by inequality 1 as q > (1−q) for q > 1/2.
thus, recalling that q > 1/2, we see u"s payoff with strategy b is q(zab + zb) whereas his payoff with strategy ab is q(zab + zb) + (1 − q)za − c. in order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that (1 − q)za ≥ c. (1) now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the potential function of −qza + c as za edges are removed from the xa,b edges between a and b and the size of partition piece ab is increased by one.
let zab, za, and zb denote the number of neighbors of u in partition piece ab, a, and b respectively.
suppose a node u with strategy b switches to strategy ab.
therefore we have three cases: a node u switches from strategy b to ab, a node u switches from strategy ab to a, or a node u switches from strategy b to a. we consider the first case here; the proofs for the other cases are similar.
by lemma 4.1, we only need to analyze the effect on the potential function for moves of the sort described by the lemma.
we now show that every best response move decreases the value of this function by some positive amount bounded away from zero.
since g has bounded degree and the initial set t is finite, the initial value of this potential function is finite.
the potential function is the following: qxa,b + cnab (recall c = δr is the cost of adopting two technologies).
at any state in the game, let xa,b denote the number of edges in g that have one endpoint using strategy a and the other endpoint  using strategy b. furthermore, let nab denote the number of agents using the strategy ab.
we derive a contradiction by defining a non-negative 80 potential function that starts with a finite value and showing that after each best response by some vertex the value of this function decreases by some positive amount bounded away from zero.
assume, for contradiction, that there is a δ-regular graph g and values q > 1/2 and r, a set t of vertices of g that are initially endowed with the strategy a, and a schedule s of moves for vertices in v (g) \ t such that this sequence leads to an all-a equilibrium.
theorem 5.1. for every δ-regular graph g and parameters q and r, the technology a cannot become an epidemic in the game (g, q, r) if q > 1/2.
the first theorem shows that no point (q, r) with q > 1 2 belongs to ω. since q > 1 2 implies that the incumbent technology b is superior, it implies that in any network, a superior incumbent will survive for any level of compatibility.
the analysis here uses lemma 4.1 and an argument based on an appropriately defined potential function.
we now consider the region ω = ∪gω(g), where the union is taken over all infinite δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r)  values for which a can become epidemic in some δ-regular network.
graphs the characterization theorem in the previous section provides one way of thinking about the region ω(g), the set of all (q, r) pairs for which a can become epidemic in the game (g, q, r).
