note they also exhibit non-convexities. 
figures 3 and 4 show the epidemic regions for the infinite grid and the infinite δ-regular tree.
it is not hard to see that for points outside this region, a cannot become epidemic.
further examples: trees and grids.
however, since vertices of g have finite degree, it is not hard to see that any ordering of a multiset containing any (possibly infinite) 78 1/20 r q 0 1/4 3/16 1/12 1/4 figure 3: epidemic regions for the infinite grid 1/20 1/δ r q 0 1/δ figure 4: epidemic regions for the infinite δ-regular tree the above argument shows that for any combination of (q, r) parameters in the marked region in figure 1, technology a can become an epidemic.

, 1, −1, 2, −2, .
change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2,  every agent will switch to strategy a, and hence a becomes an  epidemic.4 4 strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as a single infinite sequence of vertices in v (g) \ t, the order 1, −1, 2, −2, .
next, if we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, .
play their best response in this order, then every agent (except for agents in group 0) switches to ab.
hence, if the above inequality holds and we let agents in groups 2, −2, 3, −3 .
therefore, if max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 1 − q and max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 2q, or equivalently, if 2r ≤ q and q + r ≤ 1 2 , the best response of such an agent is ab.
for these agents (and similarly for the agents in group −2), the payoff of strategies a, b, and ab are (1−q)δ/2, qδ, and (q+max(q, 1−q))δ/2− rδ, respectively.
after this, agents in group 2 will see ab on their left and b on their right.
therefore, if we let agents in groups 1 and −1 change to their best response, they would switch their strategy to ab.
also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best response of an agent with her neighbors on one side playing a and neighbors on the other side playing b is the strategy ab.
play their best response in this order, then a will become an epidemic.
therefore, if q ≤ 1 2 and q ≤ 2r, the best response of such an agent is a. hence, if the above  inequality holds and we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, .
figure 2 shows a picture of l6 now, assume that starting from a position where every node uses the strategy b, we endow all agents in a group (say, group 0) with the strategy a. consider the decision faced by the agents in group 1, who have their right-hand neighbors using b and their left-hand neighbors using a. for these agents, the payoffs of strategies a, b, and ab are (1 − q)δ/2, qδ/2, and δ/2 − rδ, respectively.
, δ/2} the x"th group of vertices.
there is an edge between vertices (x, i) and (x , i ) if and only if |x − x | = 1. for each x ∈ z, we call the set of vertices {(x, i) : i ∈ {1, .
for a given even  integer δ, we define the thick line graph lδ as follows: the vertex set of this graph is z × {1, 2, .

we then  describe, without the accompanying detailed analysis, the epidemic regions for the infinite δ-regular tree and for the two-dimensional grid.
0−1 1 2 figure 2: the thick line graph in section 1. we first discuss a natural δ-regular generalization of the infinite line graph, and for this one we work out the complete analysis that describes the region ω(g), the set of all pairs (q, r) for which the technology a can become an epidemic.
3 note that we assume agents in the seed set t cannot change their strategy.
however, the difference between these definitions is rather minor and our results carry over with little or no change to these alternative models.
alternatively, one can define the notion of epidemic by allowing agents in t to be endowed with any combination of ab and a, or with just ab.
we begin by considering some basic examples that yield  epidemic regions with the kinds of non-convexity properties discussed 2 note that in our definition we assume that agents in t are endowed with the strategy a at the beginning.
