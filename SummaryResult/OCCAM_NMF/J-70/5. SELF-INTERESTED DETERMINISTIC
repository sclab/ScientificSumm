in the next section, we show that the hardness of design disappears when we allow for randomization in the mechanism.
both of our hardness results relied on the constraint that the mechanism should be deterministic.
because our mechanism achieves the goal, it follows that v |θ|+s|θ|+(|c|−s)(|θ|+1) θ ≥ g, which by simple algebraic manipulations is equivalent to s ≤ k. so there is a solution to the minsat instance.
it follows that the expected value of the objective function for our mechanism is at most v |θ|+s|θ|+(|c|−s)(|θ|+1) θ , where s is the number of satisfied 137 clauses.
finally, for any unsatisfied clause c, the maximum value the  objective function can take in the case where the agent  reports type θc is |θ| + 1, simply because this is the largest value the function ever takes.
(this is because we cannot choose the outcome o∗ for such a type, as in this case the agent would have an incentive to report θv instead, where v is the variable satisfying c in the  assignment (so that o(θv) = ol where l occurs in c).)
for any clause c satisfied by the given assignment, the value of the objective function in the case where the agent reports type θc will be at most |θ|.
by the above, for any type θv, the value of the objective function in this mechanism will be |θ|.
we claim this assignment is a solution to the minsat instance.
we can interpret this as an assignment of truth values to the variables: v is set to true if o(θv) = o+v, and to false if o(θv) = o−v.
it follows that in the solution to the amd instance, for every v ∈ v , o(θv) ∈ {o+v, o−v}.
this has an objective value of 0, and because the highest value the objective function ever takes is |θ| + 1, it follows that the maximum expected value of the objective function that could be obtained is at most (|θ|−1)(|θ|+1) |θ| < |θ| < g, contradicting that this is a  solution to the amd instance.
the only other outcome that the mechanism is allowed to choose under the ir constraint is o0.
now suppose there is a solution to the amd instance, given by an outcome function o. first, suppose there is some v ∈ v such that o(θv) /∈ {o+v, o−v}.
if s is the number of satisfied clauses in the minsat solution (so that s ≤ k), then the expected value of the designer"s objective function is |v ||θ|+s|θ|+(|c|−s)(|θ|+1) |θ| ≥ |v ||θ|+k|θ|+(|c|−k)(|θ|+1) |θ| = |θ| + |c|−k |θ| = g. so there is a solution to the amd  instance.
finally, we show that the goal is reached.
this  establishes that the agent never has an incentive to misreport.
because also, no type leads to the outcome oc, there is no outcome that the mechanism ever selects that would give the agent utility greater than 1 for type θc, and hence the agent has no incentive to report falsely.
in this case, we observe that for none of the types, reporting it leads to an outcome ol for a literal l ∈ c, precisely because the clause is not satisfied in the  minsat instance.
the final case to check is where the agent"s type is some θc where c is an unsatisfied clause.
if the agent"s type is some θc where c is a satisfied clause, again, it is getting the maximum utility for that type, so it has no incentive to misreport.
if the agent"s type is some θv, it is getting the maximum utility for that type, so it has no  incentive to misreport.
we now check that the agent has no incentive to misreport.
it is straightforward to check that the ir constraint is satisfied.
for every c ∈ c that is satisfied in the  minsat solution, let o(θc) = oc; for every unsatisfied c ∈ c, let o(θc) = o∗ .
then, for every v ∈ v , let o(θv) = of(v).
let the assignment of truth values to the variables in this solution be given by the function f : v → l (where v(f(v)) = v for all v ∈ v ).
first, suppose there is a solution to the minsat instance.
we show the instances are equivalent.
let the designer"s objective function be given by g(o∗ ) = |θ|+1; g(ol) = |θ| for all l ∈ l; g(oc) = |θ| for all c ∈ c. the goal of the amd instance is g = |θ| + |c|−k |θ| , where k is the goal of the minsat instance.
let l ∈ c denote that the literal l occurs in clause c. then, let the agent"s utility function be given by u(θc, ol) = 2 for all l ∈ l with l ∈ c; u(θc, ol) = −1 for all l ∈ l with l /∈ c; u(θc, oc) = 2; u(θc, oc ) = −1 for all c ∈ c with c = c ; u(θc, o∗ ) = 1; u(θv, ol) = 1 for all l ∈ l with v(l) = v; u(θv, ol) = −1 for all l ∈ l with v(l) = v; u(θv, oc) = −1 for all c ∈ c; u(θv, o∗ ) = −1.
let the notation v(l) = v denote that v is the variable corresponding to the literal l, that is, l ∈ {+v, −v}.
let the outcome set be o = {o0} ∪ {oc : c ∈ c}∪{ol : l ∈ l}∪{o∗ }, where l is the set of literals, that is, l = {+v : v ∈ v } ∪ {−v : v ∈ v }.
let the probability distribution over these types be uniform.
let the agent"s type set be θ = {θc : c ∈ c} ∪ {θv : v ∈ v }, where c is the set of clauses in the minsat instance, and v is the set of variables.
to show np-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary minsat  instance to the following single-agent self-interested  deterministic amd without payments instance.
it is easy to show that the problem is in np.
theorem 2. without payments, deterministic amd for a self-interested designer is np-complete, even for a single agent, even with a uniform distribution over types.
we show that this problem is hard even in the single-agent setting, thereby immediately showing it hard for both ir concepts, for both solution concepts.
amd without payments is hard in this section we demonstrate that it is np-complete to design a deterministic mechanism that maximizes the  expectation of the designer"s objective when payments are not possible.
