finally, we plan to assemble a data set of real-world mechanism design problems-both historical and current-and apply automated mechanism  design to those problems.
we also want to study the  complexity of automated mechanism design in settings where the outcome and type spaces have special structure so they can be represented more concisely.
future research includes studying automated mechanism design with a self-interested designer in more restricted  settings such as auctions (where the designer"s objective may include preferences about which bidder should receive the good-as well as payments).
we showed that here, too, designing an  optimal deterministic mechanism is np-complete even with one agent, but designing an optimal randomized mechanism is easy.
finally, we showed that the  paymentmaximizing amd problem is closely related to an interesting variant of the optimal (revenue-maximizing) combinatorial auction design problem, where the bidders have best-only preferences.
we then showed that allowing randomization in the mechanism makes the design problem in all these settings computationally easy.
the hardness results apply whether the individual  rationality (participation) constraints are applied ex interim or ex post, and whether the solution concept is dominant  strategies implementation or bayes-nash equilibrium  implementation.
these  hardness results imply hardness in all more general automated mechanism design settings with a self-interested designer.
in this setting, we showed that designing an optimal  deterministic mechanism is np-complete in two important  special cases: when the center is interested only in the payments made to it, and when payments are not possible and the  center is interested only in the outcome chosen.
the reason that the agents" preferences are relevant is that the center is  constrained to making each agent at least as well off as the agent would have been had it not participated in the mechanism.
in this setting, the center cares only about which outcome is chosen and what payments are made to it.
unlike earlier work on automated mechanism design that studied a  benevolent designer, in this paper we studied automated  mechanism design problems where the designer is  self-interesteda setting much more relevant for electronic commerce.
this has several advantages, 139 but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time.
in a recently emerging approach-called automated mechanism design-a mechanism is computed for the specific preference aggregation setting at hand.
mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their  preferences truthfully, and a desirable outcome is chosen.
the key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences insincerely to make the chosen outcome more favorable to themselves.
research often, an outcome must be chosen on the basis of the preferences reported by a group of agents.
