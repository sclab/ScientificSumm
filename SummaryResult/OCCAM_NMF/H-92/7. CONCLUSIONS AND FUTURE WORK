we also thank robert ragno for his valuable suggestions and many discussions. 
acknowledgments we thank chris burges and matt richardson for an implementation of ranknet for our experiments.
as another research direction we are exploring methods for extending our predictions to the previously unseen queries (e.g., query clustering), which should further improve the web search experience of users.
one promising direction for future work is to apply recent research on automatically predicting query difficulty, and only attempt to incorporate implicit feedback for the difficult queries.
interestingly, implicit feedback is particularly valuable for queries with poor original ranking of results (e.g., map lower than 0.1).
the gains are particularly dramatic for the top k=1 result in the final ranking, with precision improvements as high as 31%, and the gains are substantial for all values of k. our experiments showed that implicit user feedback can further improve web search performance, when incorporated directly with popular content- and link-based features.
our experiments showed significant improvement over methods that do not consider implicit feedback.
we compared two alternatives of incorporating implicit feedback into the search process, namely reranking with implicit feedback and incorporating implicit feedback features directly into the trained ranking function.
we performed a large-scale evaluation over 3,000 queries and more than 12 million user interactions with a major search engine, establishing the utility of incorporating noisy implicit feedback to improve web search relevance.
in this paper we explored the utility of incorporating noisy implicit feedback obtained in a real web search setting to improve web search ranking.
