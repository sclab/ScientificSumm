instead of treating each user as a reliable expert, we aggregate information from multiple, unreliable, user search session traces, as we describe in the next two sections. 
we build on existing research to develop robust user behavior interpretation techniques for the real web search setting.
at the same time, while recent work (e.g., [26]) on using clickthrough information for improving web search ranking is promising, it captures only one aspect of the user interactions with web search engines.
unfortunately, the extent to which previous research applies to real-world web search is unclear.
by performing eye tracking studies and correlating predictions of their strategies with explicit ratings, the authors showed that it is possible to accurately interpret clickthroughs in a controlled, laboratory setting.
[12] presented an empirical evaluation of interpreting clickthrough evidence.
more recently, joachims et al.
other studies of user behavior in web search include pharo and j√§rvelin [19], but were not directly applied to improve ranking.
however, the modeling effort was aimed at predicting explicit relevance judgments from implicit user actions and not specifically at learning ranking functions.
this work considered a wide range of user behaviors (e.g., dwell time, scroll time, reformulation patterns) in addition to the popular clickthrough behavior.
[8] explored the relationship between implicit and explicit measures in web search, and developed bayesian models to correlate implicit measures and explicit relevance judgments for both individual queries and search sessions.
fox et al.
closely related to our work, joachims [11] collected implicit measures in place of explicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.
this research, while developing valuable insights into implicit relevance measures, was not applied to improve the ranking of web search results in realistic settings.
an overview of implicit measures is compiled in kelly and teevan [14].
implicit relevance measures have been studied by several research groups.
however, with increasing popularity of search engines, implicit feedback (i.e., the actions users take when interacting with the search engine) can be used to improve the rankings.
most common approaches primarily focus on similarity of query and a page, as well as the overall page quality [3,4,24].
ranking search results is a fundamental problem in information retrieval.
