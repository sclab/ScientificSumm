in this paper a solution for a multi-server environment is presented without consideration of  communication or migration costs. 
agents make their decisions themselves based on forecasts of the server utilisation.
a mobile agent will reject a migration to a remote agent server, if it expects the destination server to be  already overloaded by other agents or server tasks.
we [19] proposed a self-organising load balancing approach for a single server with focus on optimising the communication costs of mobile agents.
a resource allocation approach for sensor networks based on self-organisation techniques and reinforcement learning is presented in [16] with main focus on the optimisation of energy consumption of network nodes.
in this paper, the system objective is to maximise system throughput while ensuring fairness to resources, measured as the average processing time per job unit.
similar to our approach, a set of agents  compete for a limited number of resources based only on prior individual experience.
another distributed technique that is employed for solving the resource allocation problem is based on reinforcement learning [18].
they showed that agents can adapt effectively to changing capacities in this  environment using a set of simple look-up tables (strategies) per agent.
[14] studied a variation with more than two resources, changing resource capacities and information from neighbour agents.
galstyan et al.
in this repetitive decision game, an odd number of agents have to choose between two resources based on past success information trying to allocate itself at the resource with the minority.
a variation of the el farol problem is the so called minority game [8].
it is probably one of the most studied examples of complex adaptive systems derived from the human way of deciding ill-defined problems.
it is an ill-defined decision problem that assumes and models inductive reasoning.
for example, arthur [2] introduced the so called el farol bar problem that does not allow a perfect, logical and rational solution.
most of them are formulated as  repetitive games in an idealistic and simplified environment.
there has been considerable work on decentralised  resource allocation techniques using game theory published over recent years.
the proposed mechanism in this paper eliminates the need of periodic  information exchange about resource loads and does not need a connection topology between the resources.
the job"s migration itinerary is determined by the resources in connecting them in different topologies [17].
subtasks of a job migrate through the network until they find a resource that meets the price constraints.
drawback of this model is the extensive use of message exchange between agents for periodic  monitoring and information exchange within the hierarchical  structure.
the agent based resource allocation model (aram) for grids is designed to schedule computational expensive jobs using agents.
developed a resource allocation framework based on the regulation of supply and demand [4] for nimrod-g [6] with the main focus on job deadlines and budget constraints.
buyya et al.
a collection of different distributed resource allocation techniques based on market models is presented in clearwater [10].
users try to purchase cheap resources required to run the job while providers try to make as much profit as possible and operate the available resources at full capacity.
these approaches use different pricing strategies such as posted price models, different auction methods or a commodity market model.
inspired by the principles in stock markets, economic market models have been developed for trading resources for the  regulation of supply and demand in the grid.
the value of distributed solutions for the resource  allocation problem has been recognised by research [10].
an example of a dynamic resource  allocation algorithm is the cactus project [1] for the allocation of computational very expensive jobs.
those coordinators usually need to have global knowledge on the state of all system resources.
most of today"s techniques for resource allocation in grid computing toolkits like globus [12] or condor-g [13]  coordinate the resource allocation with an auctioneer,  arbitrator, dispatcher, scheduler or manager.
this technique can only provide a good  supplement for distributed resource allocation mechanisms.
from the resource owner perspective, this technique is important to prevent overload at the resource but it is not sufficient for effective resource allocation.
a simple distributed technique for resource management is capacity planning by refusing or queuing incoming agents to avoid resource overload [11].
this mechanism works best in a homogeneous system.
load balancing [3] is a special case of the resource allocation problem using a broker that tries to be fair to all resources by balancing the system load equally among all resource providers.
in those approaches, the resource consumer cannot influence the allocation  decision process.
all incoming requests are directed to the broker who is the solely decision maker.
the broker usually has full knowledge about all system resources.
in the simplest case, resource consumers ask a central broker or dispatcher for available resources where the resource consumer will be  allocated.
generally speaking, resource allocation is a mechanism or policy for the efficient and effective management of the access to a limited resource or set of resources by its consumers.
over the past years, solutions based on different assumptions and constraints have been proposed by different research groups [7, 3, 15, 10].
resource allocation is an important problem in the area of computer science.
