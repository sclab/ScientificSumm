the multi-agent system model used for our simulations is illustrated in fig.
in this case, some agents must wait with their allocation request until free resources are expected.
that is, the overall shared resource capacity is lower than the amount of requested  resources by agents.
u(li, t) = n j=1 u(tj, t)| l(tj, t) = li (1) additional to the case that the total amount of system  resources is enough to execute all tasks, we are also interested in the case that not enough system resources are provided to fulfil all allocation requests.
the resource  utilisation of a server li at time t is calculated using equation 1, by adding the resource consumption u(tj, t) of each task tj that is executed at the resource at time t. all resource units used in our model represent real metrics such as memory or processor cycles.
the amount of provided resources c(li, t) of each server can vary over time.
resources in the system can be used by all agents for the execution of tasks.
to address the set of resources known by agent ai.

we write ls (ai) the sixth intl.
the task"s execution location in general is specified by the map l : t ×t → l. an agent has to know about the existence of server resources in order to allocate tasks at those resources.
resources for the execution of tasks are provided by each server li.
a task ti  requires u(ti, t) resources for its execution at time t  independent from its execution server.
each agent has a number of tasks ti that needs to be executed during its lifetime.
