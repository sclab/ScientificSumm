the  performance can be further improved with two-stage smoothing.
the results show that while their basic  models perform comparably, the poisson model can outperform multinomial model with per-term smoothing.
we present several variants of the new model corresponding to different smoothing  methods, and evaluate them on four representative trec test collections.
we show that the poisson model has several  advantages over the multinomial model, including naturally  accommodating per-term smoothing and allowing for more  accurate background modeling.
we show that while in their simplest forms, the new family of models and the existing multinomial models are equivalent, they behave differently for many smoothing methods.
in this paper, we propose and study a new family of query generation models based on poisson  distribution.
most existing models are based on multinomial distribution and would score documents based on query likelihood computed based on a query generation probabilistic model.
many variants of language models have been proposed for information retrieval.
