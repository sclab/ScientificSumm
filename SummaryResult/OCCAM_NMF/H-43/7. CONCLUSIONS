also, thanks to the reviewers for constructive comments. 
acknowledgment we would like to thank dr. dengyong zhou for sharing his code of his algorithm.
we also discuss an extension for clustering application.
our experiments show our approach is effective for classification.
by sharing  factors between text content and link structure, it is easy to combine both the content information and link structure.
the directed links are generated from the linear combination of linkage of between source and destination factors.
we propose a simple approach using factors to model the text content and link structure of web pages/documents.
in this paper, we study the problem of how to combine the  information of content and links for web page analysis, mainly on  classification application.
