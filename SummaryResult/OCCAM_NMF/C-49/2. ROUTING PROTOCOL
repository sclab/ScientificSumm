nodes share their link-state weights when they can communicate with each other, and messages are forwarded to the node that have the path with the lowest link-state weight.
the exponentially aged inter-contact duration of node i and j is computed by wij = αwij + (1 − α)i, (4) where i is the new inter-contact duration and α is the aging factor.
they use the median inter-contact duration or exponentially aged  intercontact duration as the weight on links.
[22] use a link-state approach to estimate the weight of each path from the source of a message to the destination.
2.5 link-state protocol su et al.
when node i receives node j"s delivery  probabilities, node i may compute the transitive delivery probability through j to z with piz = piz + (1 − piz)pijpjzβ, (3) where β is a design parameter for the impact of transitivity; we used β = 0.25 as did lindgren [16].
the prophet protocol exchanges index messages as well as  delivery probabilities.
when node i does not meet j for some time, the delivery probability decreases by pij = αk pij, (2) where α is the aging factor (α < 1), and k is the number of time units since the last update.
[16] chose 0.75, as did we in our  evaluation.
lindgren et al.
when node i meets node j, the delivery probability of node i for j is updated by pij = (1 − pij)p0 + pij, (1) where p0 is an initial probability, a design parameter for a given network.
2.4 prophet protocol prophet [16] is a probabilistic routing protocol using history of past encounters and transitivity to estimate each node"s delivery probability for each other node.
the message has some chance of  being transferred to a highly mobile node, and thus may have a better chance to reach its destination before the message expires.
we use a simple replication strategy that allows only the source node to make replicas, and limits the replication to a specific number of copies.
2.3 random routing an obvious approach between the above two extremes is to  select a transfer probability between 0 and 1 to forward messages at each contact.
thus, by examining the index messages, a node only transfers  messages that are not yet contained on the other nodes.
the  index messages contain ids of messages that a node currently holds.
an optimization to reduce the communication cost is to  transfer index messages before transferring any data message.
after a message expires, the message will not be transmitted and will be deleted from the storage of any node that holds the message.
at a minimum, each node must expire messages after some amount of time or stop forwarding them after a certain number of hops.
moreover, since each node keeps a copy of each message, storage is not used efficiently, and the capacity of the network is limited.
this protocol is simple, but may use significant resources;  excessive communication may drain each node"s battery quickly.
eventually, a copy of the message arrives at the destination of the message.
the nodes that receive a copy of the message also send a copy of the message to every node that they meet.
the source node sends a copy of the message to every node that it meets.
2.2 epidemic routing protocol the epidemic routing protocol [23] floods messages into the  network.
in mobile opportunistic networks, however, the probability for the sender to meet the destination may be low, or even zero.
2.1 direct delivery protocol in this simple protocol, a message is transmitted only when the source node can directly communicate with the destination node of the message.
node i has a contact history hi(j), for each other node j, which denotes the historical contacts between node i and node j. we record the start and end time for each contact; however, the last contacts in the node"s contact history may not have ended.
the contact history of a node is a sequence of contacts with other nodes.
a node may be in contact with several other nodes at the same time.
although we are aware that wireless technologies differ, we assume that a node can reliably detect the beginning and end time of a contact with nearby nodes.
a contact is defined as a period of time during which two nodes have the opportunity to communicate.
then we describe five existing protocols before presenting our own  proposal.
first, we define the notion of contact between two nodes.
all other protocols are between the two extremes.
both these protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.
the latter uses transfer probability 1 for all nodes and unlimited replication.
the former transfers with probability 1 when the node meets the destination, 0 for others, and no replication.
two extremes are the direct-delivery protocol and the epidemic protocol.
dtn routing protocols could be described in part by their  transfer probability and replication probability; that is, when one node meets another node, what is the probability that a message should be transfered and if so, whether the sender should retain its copy.
in this paper, we consider only messages that are unicast (single destination).
any node may  generate messages for any other node, and may carry messages destined for other nodes.
a routing protocol is designed for forwarding messages from one node (source) to another node (destination).
