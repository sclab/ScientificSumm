if m of the blocks are received at the  destination, the message can be restored, where m < k. in a uniformly distributed mobility scenario, the delivery probability increases  because the probability that the destination node meets m relays is greater than it meets k relays, given m < k.

the source node replicates a message m times, then uses a coding scheme to encode them in one big message.
erasure-coding [10, 24] explores coding algorithms to reduce  message replicas.
network coding also draws much interest from dtn research.
when two nodes are in the same connected cloud, dsdv [19] routing is used.
this protocol assumes group mobility and cloud connectivity, that is, nodes move as a group, and among this group of nodes a  contemporaneous end-to-end connection exists for every pair of nodes.
they use a kalman filter to compute the probability that a node delivers messages.
[17] propose an adaptive routing protocol for  intermittently connected mobile ad-hoc networks.

location  information of nodes is required to construct mobility patterns.
[15] use a high-dimensional space to represent a mobility pattern, then routes messages to nodes that are closer to the destination node in the mobility pattern space.
leguay et al.
our protocol does not require knowledge of the nodes" locations, and learns their contact patterns.
a node forwards data to a neighbor only if the  neighbor is closer to the destination than its own position.
their algorithm assumes that every node knows its own position, and the destination is stationary at a known location.
[14] propose a location-based delay-tolerant  network routing protocol.

we did not implement and evaluate these routing protocols, because either they require domain-specific  information (location information) [14, 15], assume certain mobility patterns [17], present orthogonal approaches [10, 24] to other  routing protocols.
in addition to the protocols that we evaluated in our simulation, several other opportunistic network routing protocols have been proposed in the literature.
