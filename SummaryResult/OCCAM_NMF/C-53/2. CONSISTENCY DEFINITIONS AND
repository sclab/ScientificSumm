given two distinct sites i and j, which have replicated a shared entity e, at a given time point t, the positions of e at sites i and j are (xit, yit, zit) and (xjt, yjt, zjt), de(i, j, t) and d (i, j, t1, t2) could be calculated as: de(i, j, t) = )zz()yy()xx( jtit 2 jtit 2 jtit 2 (3) de(i, j, t1, t2) = dt)zz()yy()xx( 2t 1t jtit 2 jtit 2 jtit 2 (4) in this paper, formulas (3) and (4) are used as metrics to measure the consistency of shared entities between local and remote sites. 
the velocities of entities).
if de(i, j, t1, t2) > de(l, k, t1, t2), it can be stated that between time points t1 and t2, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. in dr, the states of entities are composed of the positions and orientations of entities and some prediction related parameters (e.g.
if de(i, j, t1, t2) > de(i, j, t3, t4) and |t1 - t2| = |t3 - t4|, it can be stated that between sites i and j, the consistency of the states of entity e between time points t1 and t2 is lower than that between time points t3 and t4.
if de(i, j, t) > de(l, k, t), it can be stated that, at time point t, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. similarly, de(i, j, t1, t2) can been used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency in a certain time period.
if de(i, j, t1) > de(i, j, t2), it can be stated that between sites i and j, the consistency of the states of entity e at time point t1 is lower than that at time point t2.
de(i, j, t) can be used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency at a certain time point.
corresponding metrics are needed to measure the consistency of shared entities between local and remote sites.
due to network transmission delay, it is difficult to maintain the states of shared entities absolutely consistent.
definition 1: the states of e at sites i and j are consistent at time t, iff: de(i, j, t) = |si(t) - sj(t)| = 0 (1) definition 2: the states of e at sites i and j are consistent between time t1 and t2 (t1 < t2), iff: de(i, j, t1, t2) = dt|)t(s)t(s| t2 t1 ji = 0 (2) in this paper, formulas (1) and (2) are used to determine whether the states of shared entities are consistent between local and remote sites.
given two distinct sites i and j, which have replicated a shared entity e, at a given time t, the states of e at sites i and j are si(t) and sj(t).
here, we present an alternative definition of consistency in continuous domain, which suits state transmission based methods well.
dr).
mauve et al [1] have given a definition of consistency for replicated applications in continuous domain, but the definition is based on operation transmission and it is difficult for the definition to describe state transmission based methods (e.g.
metrics the consistency of replicated applications has already been well defined in discrete domain [9, 10, 11, 12], but few related work has been done in continuous domain.
