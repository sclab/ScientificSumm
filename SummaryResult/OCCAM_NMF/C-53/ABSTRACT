performance evaluation shows that gs-dr-ll can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.
in this paper, a method named globally synchronized dr with local lag (gs-dr-ll), which combines local lag and globally synchronized dr (gs-dr), is presented.
with the help of global synchronization, dr can achieve higher consistency, but it still cannot eliminate before inconsistency.
however, dr cannot maintain high consistency, and this constrains its application in highly interactive games.
since dr can filter most unnecessary state updates and improve the scalability of a system, it is widely used in commercial cdmg.
dead-reckoning (dr) is an effective method to maintain consistency for continuous distributed multiplayer games (cdmg).
