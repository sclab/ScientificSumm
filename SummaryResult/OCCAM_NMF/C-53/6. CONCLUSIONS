internet based games). 
as a result, the application of local lag can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems which have large typical network transmission delay (e.g.
second, gs-dr-ll shows that by combining local lag and  gsdr, the constraint on selecting lag value is removed and a lag, which is smaller than typical network transmission delay, could be used.
highly interactive games).
as a result, the application of dr can be greatly broadened and it could be used in the systems which request high consistency (e.g.
first, gs-dr-ll shows that improved dr can not only eliminate after inconsistency but also decrease 6 the 5th workshop on network & system support for games 2006 - netgames 2006 before inconsistency, with proper lag and threshold, it would even eliminate before inconsistency.
gs-dr-ll has significant implications to consistency maintenance approaches.
performance evaluation indicates that gs-dr-ll can effectively decrease before inconsistency, and the effects increase with the lag.
in this paper, we proposed a method named gs-dr-ll, which combines local lag and gs-dr, to decrease before inconsistency through delaying updating the execution results of local operations to local scene.
compared with traditional dr, gs-dr can eliminate after inconsistency through the synchronization of physical clocks, but it cannot tackle before inconsistency, which would significantly influence the usability and fairness of a game.
