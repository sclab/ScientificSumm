we note that when restricted to simple games, we derive similar results to that in [4]. 
multiattribute coalitional games generalize these by considering relationship between the committee and the resources  beyond simple games.
in these games, there is usually an underlying set of resources each controlled by a  (possibly overlapping) set of players known as the committee, engaged in a simple game (defined in section 3).
our work is also related to the study of cooperative games with committee control [4].
1 we acknowledge that random instances may not be typical of what happens in practice, but given the generality of our model, it provides the most unbiased view.
our focus is on reasoning about traditional solution concepts.
also, they focus on developing new solution concepts that are robust with respect to manipulation by agents.
assume that each skill is fundamentally different from another, hence no two agents may possess the same skill.
firstly, yokoo et al.
there are two major differences between their work and ours.
have also considered a model of coalitional games where agents are modeled by sets of skills, and these skills in turn determine the value of coalitions [15].
yokoo et al.
our model also covers a wider scope as attributes generalize the notion of capabilities.
our work differs significantly as our focus is on  reasoning about solution concepts.
they model the agents as possessing capabilities that indicates their  proficiencies in different areas, and consider how to efficiently allocate tasks [12] and the dynamics of coalition formation [13].
the model of coalitional games with attributes has been considered in the works of shehory and kraus.
we will  therefore not make further comparisons with [2].
in this paper, we stay within the boundary of games that admits efficient  algorithm for determining the value of coalitions.
while it is possible for multi-attribute coalitional games to efficiently represent these games, it necessarily  requires the solution to an np-hard problem in order to find out the values of some coalitions.
this representation is succinct, but to find the values of some coalitions may require solving an np-hard problem.
the relationship of these models will be made clear after we define the  multiattribute representation in section 4. another representation proposed in the literature is one specialized for superadditive games by conitzer and  sandholm [2].
the key difference in our work is the unrestricted aggregation of subgames: the aggregation could be via a polynomial function of the attributes, or even by treating the subgames as input to another computational problem such as a min-cost flow problem.
both of these representations are based on dividing a coalitional game into subgames (termed issues in [3] and rules in [7]), and aggregating the subgames via linear combination.
as a formal representation, multi-attribute coalitional games is closely related to the multi-issue representation of conitzer and sandholm [3] and our work on marginal contribution networks [7].
this can be efficiently modeled and generalized using attributes.
they consider coalitional games defined on graphs, where the players are the vertices and the value of coalition is determined by the sum of the weights of the edges spanned by these players.
the first algorithmic study of coalitional games, as far as we know, is performed by deng and papadimitriou in [5].
a vast amount of literature have focused on defining and comparing solution concepts, and  determining their existence and properties.
coalitional game theory has been well studied in  economics [9, 10, 14].
