we also carry out experiments to evaluate how the heuristic performs on random instances.1 
we provide an explicit bound on the maximum error of the estimate, and show that the bound is  asymptotically tight.
170 • we study an approximation heuristic for the shapley value when its exact values cannot be found efficiently.
we discuss two positive results in the paper, one for the shapley value and one for the core, and show how these imply related results in the literature.
• given the generality of the model, positive results carry over to other representations.
we show that when compared to other representations, there exists games for which a multi-attribute description can be  exponentially more succinct, and for no game it is worse.
our contributions can be summarized as follows: • we define a formal representation for coalitional games based on attributes, and relate this representation to others proposed in the literature.
our goal is to understand the computational aspects of computing the solution  concepts (stable and/or fair distribution of payoffs, formally defined in section 3) for coalitional games described using attributes.
coalitional game theory focuses on what groups of agents can achieve, and thus connects strongly with e-commerce, as the internet economies have significantly enhanced the abilities of business to identify and capitalize on profitable opportunities of cooperation.
as attributes apply to both individual agents and groups of agents, we propose the use of coalitional game theory to understand what groups may form and what payoffs the agents may expect in such models.
many real-world problems can be likewise modeled by picking the right attributes.
given the exogenous input of market prices, the value of a group of companies will be determined by these attributes.
to model the metal industry, the relevant attributes are the amount of ores and the  processing capacities of the companies.
two or more companies may benefit from trading ores and processing  capacities with one another.
however, each company is limited by the amount of ores it has, and its capacities in processing given kinds of ores.
for  example, when the price of aluminum goes up, they will  allocate more resources to producing aluminum.
they optimize their production profile according to the market prices for their products.
they have mines for various types of ores, and also mills capable of processing and producing  different kinds of metal.
companies in the metals industry are usually vertically-integrated and diversified.
consider an example from the business world.
at a finer level, we can extend the model to consider a wider range of skills, such as passing,  shooting, and tackling, but the value of a team remains solely a function of the attributes of its players.
the value of a team depends on how well its players can play these positions.
the relevant attributes of the players are their skills at playing each of the four positions.
for a team to be successful, a team needs some forwards, midfielders,  defenders, and a goalkeeper.
consider the problem of forming a soccer team.
when agents interact with one another, the value of their contribution is determined by what they can do with their skills and resources, rather than simply their identities.
