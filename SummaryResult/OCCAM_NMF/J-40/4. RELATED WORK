here again, one can see that our model is more general than these, as it allows for organisms to play any 2-player, symmetric game. 
in these three works, the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to reproduce, and analyze properties of the graph that allow a strategy to overrun the population.
the authors consider 2-action, coordination games played by players in a general undirected graph.
finally, the works most closely related to ours are [7], [15], and [6].
we consider more general games than the first model and more general graphs than the second.
with probability proportional to its fitness, an organism is chosen to  reproduce by placing a replica of itself in its neighbors position, thereby killing the neighbor.
the second model has organisms arranged around a directed  cycle, where neighbors play a 2 × 2-game.
however, the fitness of each organism is simply assigned and does not  depend on the actions of each organism"s neighborhood.
the first assumes organisms interact according to a weighted, undirected graph.
also related to our work is that of [14], where the authors propose two models.
the model we propose is more general than both of these, as it encompasses a larger class of graphs as well as a richer set of games.
in these papers the authors specify a simple, local dynamic for players to improve their payoffs by changing strategies, and analyze what type of strategies will grow to dominate the population.
in [8], [3], and [4], the authors consider specific families of graphs, such as cycles and lattices, where players play specific games, such as 2 × 2-games or k × k-coordination games.
we will briefly survey this  literature and point out the differences in the previous models and ours.
what sets our work apart is that the model we consider encompasses a significantly more general class of games and graph topologies.
there has been previous work that analyzes which  strategies are resilient to mutant invasions with respect to various types of graphs.
