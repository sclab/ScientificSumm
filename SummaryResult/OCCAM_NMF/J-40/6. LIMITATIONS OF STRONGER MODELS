by assumption, f(t|s) > f(s|t), thus, under this stronger notion of contraction, neither of the  incumbentmutant edges, (vi, wi) and (xi, wi), will contract. 
furthermore, the only incumbents in the neighborhood of wi are vi and xi, both of which have fitness f(s|t).
similarly, in the proof of theorem 6.2, observe that the only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself, which has fitness f(t|s).
also observe that there is only 1 incumbent in the neighborhood of j, namely i. so under this stronger notion of contraction, the edge (i, j) will not contract.
observe that maximum fitness mutant in the neighborhood of j must have fitness at least f(j).
in the proof of theorem 6.1 we proved that f(i) is strictly less than f(j).
if we assume that we adopt this notion of contraction for individual mutants, and require that all incumbent-mutant edges contract, we will next show that theorems 6.1 and 6.2 still hold, and thus it is still impossible to get results such as theorems 5.1 and 5.3 which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game.
6.2 stronger contraction for individuals the model of section 3 requires that for an edge (i, j) to contract, the fitness of i must be greater than the fitness of j. one way to strengthen this notion of contraction would be to require that the maximum fitness incumbent in the  neighborhood of j be more fit than the maximum fitness mutant in the neighborhood of j. this models the idea that each organism is trying to take over each place in its  neighborhood, but only the most fit organism in the neighborhood of a vertex gets the privilege of taking it.
observe that f(vi) = f(xi) = f(s|t) and f(wi) = f(t|s).
with probability 1 as n → ∞, there exists an i such that ui and wi are mutants and vi and xi are incumbents.
then, for each ui, i ∈ [n/4] add edges (ui, vi), (vi, wi) and (wi, xi).
, un/4 and add edges such that they from a clique.
pick n/4  vertices u1, u2, .
(sketch) construct gn as follows.
there exists an infinite family of graphs {gn = (vn, en)}∞ n=0, where |en| = θ(n2 ), such that for a mutant family m = {mn}∞ n=0, which is  determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability > 0, the probability there exists an edge in en that does not contract approaches 1 as n → ∞.
theorem 6.2. let f be a 2-player, symmetric game that has a classical ess s, such that there exists a mutant  strategy t = s where f(t|s) > f(s|t).
below we show that, for certain graphs and certain games, there will always exist one edge that will not contract.
theorem 5.3 stated that if s is a classical ess, then for graphs where |en| ≥ n1+γ , for some γ > 0, and where each organism is labeled a mutant with probability , one edge must contract.
in this setting, one can show that f(j) will be arbitrarily close to f(t|t) and f(i) will be a convex combination of f(s|s) and f(s|t), which are both strictly less than f(t|t).
also, label all of i"s neighbors incumbent, with the exception of j and j"s neighbors (which were already labeled mutant).
(sketch) with probability approaching 1 as n → ∞, there exists a vertex j where deg(j) is arbitrarily close to n. so label j mutant, label one of its neighbors  incumbent, denoted i, and label the rest of j"s neighborhood mutant.
let g = {gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of random graphs drawn according to gn,p, where p = ω(1/nc ) for any constant 0 ≤ c < 1. then with probability approaching 1 as n → ∞, there exists a mutant family m = {mn}∞ n=0, where tn > |mn| > n and t, > 0, in which there is an edge that does not contract.
theorem 6.1. let f be a 2-player, symmetric game that has a classical ess s for which there exists a mutant  strategy t = s with f(t|t) > f(s|s) and f(t|t) > f(s|t).
next, we prove that if we instead required every incumbent-mutant edge to contract, this need not be the case.
also, recall that theorem 5.1 stated that if s is a classical ess, then it is an ess for random graphs with adversarial mutations.
in what follows, we will say an edge (i, j) contracts if i is an incumbent, j is a mutant, and f(i) > f(j).
the two theorems in this  subsection show that if one were to strengthen our notion of contraction for the mutant set, given by definition 3.1, in this way, it would be impossible to prove theorems analogous to theorems 5.1 and 5.3. recall that definition 3.1 gave the notion of contraction for a linear sized subset of mutants.
instead, we could have required that all mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.
6.1 stronger contraction for the mutant set in section 3 we alluded to the fact that we made certain design decisions in arriving at definitions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. one such decision was to require that all but o(n) mutants have incumbent neighbors of higher fitness.
in this section we show that if one tried to strengthen the model described in section 3 in two natural ways, one would not be able to prove results as strong as theorems 5.1 and 5.2, which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game.
