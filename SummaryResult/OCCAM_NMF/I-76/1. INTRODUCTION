section 2 introduces a logical framework used in this paper.
this paper is organized as follows.
we also provide procedures for computing proposals in logic  programming.
we develop a negotiation protocol between two agents based on the exchange of these counter-proposals and critiques.
third, combining extended abduction and relaxation, conditional neighborhood proposals are  constructed as amended extensions of the original proposal.
second, we use the technique of relaxation in cooperative query answering for databases [4, 6] to construct a neighborhood proposal as an amendment of the original one.
first, we use the technique of extended abduction in artificial  intelligence [8, 15] to construct a conditional proposal as an extension of the original one.
we then introduce  methods for generating three different types of proposals.
we suppose an agent who has a knowledge base represented by a logic program.
the purpose of this paper is to mechanize a process of building (counter-)proposals in one-to-one negotiation  dialogues.
currently, there is no computational logic for automated negotiation which has general inference rules for producing (counter-)proposals.
such behavior is usually represented as specific meta-knowledge of an agent or specified as  negotiation protocols in particular problems.
in the dialogue of 1022 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas a buyer agent and a seller agent presented above, a buyer agent changes its initial goal by downgrading a driver from dvd-rw to cd-rw.
in the process of negotiation, however, it may happen that agents are obliged to weaken or change their initial goals to reach a negotiated compromise.
the objective of the agent a in the above dialogues is to obtain service x. the agent b proposes conditions to provide the  service.
in those dialogues, agents generate (counter-)proposals by reasoning on their own goals or objectives.
according to [13], the first type  appears in the dialogue: a: i propose that you provide me with service x. b: i propose that i provide you with  service x if you provide me with service z. the second type is in the dialogue: a: i propose that i provide you with service y if you provide me with service x. b: i propose that i provide you with service x if you provide me with  service z. a negotiation proceeds by iterating such  give-andtake dialogues until it reaches an agreement/disagreement.
it is known that there are two ways of producing  counterproposals: extending the initial proposal or amending part of the initial proposal.
in contrast, making counter-proposals involves generating an alternative proposal which is more favorable to the responding agent than the original one.
critiques are produced by evaluating a proposal in a  knowledge base of an agent.
in the rest of the  dialogue, b2, b3, s4 are critiques, while s2, s3, b4 are  counterproposals.
in this dialogue, in response to the opening proposal b1, the counter-proposal s1 is returned.
s4: ok, i accept your offer.
instead, i can downgrade a driver from dvd-rw to cd-rw in my initial proposal.
b4: i do not want a pc of the brand b2.
the price is exactly 1200 usd.
s3: we can provide another computer with the requested specification, except that it is made by the brand b2.
my budget is under 1200 usd.
b3: i cannot accept the price.
s2: in a normal price, the requested pc costs 1300 usd.
b2: i cannot pay it by cash.
in this case, however, service points are not added for this special discount.
s1: we can provide a pc with the requested specification if you pay for it by cash.
i want to get it at the price under 1200 usd.
b1: i want to buy a personal computer of the brand b1, with the specification of cpu:1ghz, memory:512mb, hdd: 80gb, and a dvd-rw driver.
to see these proposals in one-to-one negotiation, suppose the following negotiation dialogue between a buyer agent b and a seller agent s. (bi (or si) represents an utterance of b (or s) in the i-th round.)
the other is a counter-proposal which is an alternative proposal made in response to a previous proposal [13].
one is a critique which is a remark as to whether or not (parts of) the proposal is accepted.
an agent that received a proposal responds in two ways.
negotiation usually proceeds in a  series of rounds and each agent makes a proposal at every round.
automated negotiation has been received increasing  attention in multi-agent systems, and a number of frameworks have been proposed in different contexts ([1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14], for instance).
