section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 
in section 5, we evaluate different implicit  feedback models on the created data set.
in section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit  feedback experiments.
in section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.
in section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.
the remaining sections are organized as follows.
the experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring  additional effort from the user.
we evaluate the proposed  models using this data set.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.
we thus use the trec ap data to create a test collection with implicit  feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate  implicit feedback models.
one challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.
we propose several statistical  language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the kl-divergence model.
we use the kl-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.
specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to  improve retrieval accuracy.
while the previous work has mostly focused on using  clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough  information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.
other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].
in [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.
in [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were  proposed and evaluated.
in [11], joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough  information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback  information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of  people.
implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.
for example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.
such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.
however, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.
as a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming  language and some may be about the island.
for  example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the java programming language or the java island in  indonesia.
a major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.
we define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.
in such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries,  information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).
for a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many  iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.
in general, the retrieval results using the user"s initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].
for this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention  recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].
thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.
since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always  obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.
however, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of  retrieved documents as relevant documents.
relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for  improving retrieval accuracy.
there are many kinds of context that we can exploit.
indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].
an optimal  retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.
from a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the user"s information need.
in most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval  problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.
