d2ht have used (agent management system) ams/ (directory facilitator) df on top of dht. 
however, we have chosen to use uddi on top of dht.
in [22] d2ht describes a discovery framework built on top of dht.
while the ux server is positioned as an intermediary similarly to the uddi proxy described in our dude framework, it focuses more on the qos framework and does not attempt to implement a seamless federation mechanism such as our dht based approach.
in [21], the authors describe a uddi extension (ux) system that launches a federated query only if locally found results are not adequate.
so they do not address the issue of scalability in uddi, and instead use simple replication.
the uddi service is treated as an application article 2 service to be managed in their framework.
the focus of this work has been on the manageability of the federated service.
a federated uddi service [4] has been built on top of the planetp [3] publish-subscribe system for unstructured p2p communities.
gridvine [2] builds a logical semantic overlay on top of a physical layer consisting of p-grid [1], a structured overlay based on distributed search tree that uses prefix-based routing and changes the overlay paths as part of the network maintenance protocol to adapt to load in different parts of the keyspace.
the convergence of grid and p2p computing has been explored in [5].
then the proxy registry can contact these registries, which do semantic matchmaking to identify their matches, which are then merged at the proxy registry and returned to the client.
so the simplest extension of our work could involve using the dht to do an initial syntax-based search to identify the local registries that need to be contacted.
although our current implementation focuses on uddi version 2, in future we will consider semantic extensions to uddi, ws-discovery [16] and other grid computing standards such as monitoring and discovery service (mds) [10].
matchmaking rules are expressed in triple, a language based on horn logic.
resource and request descriptions are expressed in rdf schema, a semantic markup language.
in [12], the authors present an ontology-based matchmaker.
the grid market directory [20] was proposed for this purpose.
discovering services meeting qos and price requirements has been studied in the context of a grid economy, so that grid schedulers can use various market models such as commodity markets and auctions.
then we can deliver the scalability benefits of our current solution to both uddi and uddie registries.
the dude proxy can publish the service properties supported by uddie in the dht and support range queries using techniques proposed for such queries on dhts.
our work is complementary since we focus on how to federate the uddi registries and address the scalability issue with uddi.
uddie, an extended uddi registry for publishing and discovering services based on qos parameters, is proposed in [19].
a framework for qos-based service discovery in grids has been proposed in [18].
