in addition, we plan to revisit the service apis for a grid service discovery solution leveraging the available solutions and specifications as well as the work presented in this paper. 
some of these aspects include the ability to subscribe to resource/service information, the ability to maintain soft states and the ability to provide a variety of views for various different purposes.
furthermore, we plan to investigate other aspects of grid service discovery that extend this work.
an example of another service discovery mechanism that could benefit from such an approach is globus toolkit"s mds.
the paper has solved the scalability issues with uddi but does not preclude the application of this approach to other service discovery mechanisms.
based on initial prototype testing, we believe that dude architecture can support effective distribution of uddi registries thereby making uddi more robust and also addressing its scaling issues.
the clients are oblivious to the transparent proxy approach we have adopted and get richer and more complete response to their queries.
our architecture will enable organizations to maintain autonomous control over their uddi registries and at the same time allowing clients to query multiple registries simultaneously.
in this paper, we have described a distributed architecture to support large scale discovery of web-services.
