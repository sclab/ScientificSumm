we discuss how the ideas of cenwits can be used to build several other applications in section 7. finally, in section 8, we discuss some related issues and conclude the paper. 
in  section 6, we describe a prototype implementation of cenwits and present performance measured from this  implementation.
to simplify our presentation, we will focus on a specific application of tracking lost/injured hikers in all these sections.
in the next section, section 4, we discuss power and memory management in cenwits.
in section 3, we describe the overall  architecture of cenwits, and provide a high-level description of its functionality.
in section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.
the rest of this paper is organized as follows.
instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.
second, unlike earlier location tracking solutions, cenwits does not aim for a very high accuracy of localization.
first, unlike earlier location tracking solutions,  cenwits does not require a connected network.
while cenwits addresses the general location tracking and reporting problem in a wide-area network, there are two important differences from the earlier work done in this area.
we discuss several other sensor-based applications that can employ these techniques.
however, these techniques are quite general.
the paper describes  important techniques to combine memory, transmission and  battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.
this paper demonstrates that important large-scale applications can be built using sensors by  judiciously integrating the storage, communication and  computation capabilities of sensors.
it has amply been noted that the strength of sensor  networks comes from the fact that several sensor nodes can be distributed over a relatively large area to construct a multihop network.
each sensor can dynamically adjust its power and memory  consumption based on its remaining power or available memory.
in fact, cenwits provides an adaptive tradeoff between memory and power consumption of sensors.
using groups and partitions, the location information collected by a sensor can be distributed among several sensors, thereby reducing the amount of memory needed in one sensor to store that  information.
groups and partitions allow sensors to stay in sleep or receive modes most of the time.
the problem of limited battery life and limited memory of a sensor is addressed by incorporating the concepts of groups and partitions.
furthermore, since there is no need for a  connected sensor network, there is no need to deploy sensors in very large numbers.
a  subject only needs to wear light-weight and low-cost sensors that have gps receivers but no expensive gsm or satellite transmitters.
also, this makes cenwits cost-effective.
as a result, this system can be deployed in remote wilderness areas, as well as in large urban areas with skyscrapers and other tall structures.
instead, cenwits propagates the  location information of sensors using the concept of witnesses through an intermittently connected network.
the problem of low signal strengths (short range rf  communication) is addressed by avoiding a need for maintaining a connected network.
in particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined  storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store  important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.
180 cenwits employs several important mechanisms to  address the key problem of resource constraints (low signal strength, low power and limited memory) in sensors.
in particular, there is no need for  expensive gsm or satellite transmitters, or maintaining an adhoc network of in-situ sensors in cenwits.
this averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.
the key idea of cenwits is that it uses a concept of witnesses to convey a subject"s movement and location information to the outside world.
a subject uses gps receivers (when it can connect to a satellite) and lps to determine its current location.
cenwits is comprised of mobile, in-situ sensors that are worn by subjects (people, wild animals, or in-animate objects), access points (ap) that collect  information from these sensors, and gps receivers and location points (lp) that provide location information to the  sensors.
in this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called  cenwits (connection-less sensor-based tracking system  using witnesses).
in fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.
in a mobile environment where sensors are carried by moving people, power-efficient routing is difficult to implement and maintain over a large wilderness area.
so, while an in-situ sensor is cheap as a single unit, it is expensive to build a large network that can provide  connectivity over a large wilderness area.
an rf transmitter has a relatively smaller range of  transmission.
furthermore, a line of sight is required to transmit to satellite, and that makes it  infeasible to stay connected in narrow canyons, large cities with skyscrapers, rain forests, or even when there is a roof or some other obstruction above the transmitter, e.g.
in a car.
while a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.
as a result, it cannot operate in most wilderness areas.
for example, a gsm transmitter has to be in the range of a base station to transmit.
this requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.
all these systems require a connected network via satellites, gsm base stations, or mobile devices.
with the emergence of pervasive computing, several systems [12, 19, 1, 5, 6, 4, 11] have been developed over the last few years that make use of small devices such as cell phones,  sensors, etc.
it has been difficult to provide such a service due to lack of timely information needed to determine the current location of a person who may be in an emergency situation.
search and rescue of people in emergency situation in a timely manner is an extremely important service.
