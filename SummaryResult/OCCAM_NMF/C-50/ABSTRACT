the paper  describes this implementation and reports on the performance measured from it.
a prototype of cenwits has been implemented using berkeley mica2 motes.
it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important  information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and  intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.
it is designed for an intermittently  connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.
a key feature of cenwits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.
it is designed for search and rescue of people in emergency  situations in wilderness areas.
cenwits uses several small, commonly-available rf-based sensors, and a small number of storage and processing devices.
this paper describes the design, implementation and  evaluation of a search and rescue system called cenwits.
