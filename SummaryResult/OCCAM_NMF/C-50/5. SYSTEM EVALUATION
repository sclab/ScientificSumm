finally, the lifetime of a sensor running on two  batteries can definitely be increased significantly by using energy scavenging techniques and energy harvesting techniques [16, 14]. 
also, this time period will significantly increase when groups of hikers are moving together.
in a more realistic scenario, power is expected to last for a much longer time period.
notice that this  calculation is preliminary, because it assumes that hikers are active 24 hours of the day and a hiker encounter occurs every 90 seconds.
since, a mica2 is equipped with two batteries, a mica2 sensor can remain operation for about two months.
assuming that a node emits a beacon every 90 seconds and a hiker encounter occurs everytime a beacon is emitted (worst-case scenario), a single alkaline battery will last for (841764 ∗ 90)/(30 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 60) = 29 days.
thus, a single  alkaline battery can last for (159 ∗ 60 ∗ 60)/0.68 = 841764 hiker encounters.
an encounter between two  hikers results in exchange of about 50 witness records that takes about 0.68 seconds as calculated above.
given that the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500 mah, a battery should last for 2500/15.75 = 159 hours of transmission and reception.
so, average power consumtion due to transmission and reception is (16.5 + 15)/2 = 15.75 ma per hour.
since the radio module of mica2 is half-duplex and  assuming that the cpu is always active when a node is awake, power consumption due to transmission is 8 + 8.5 = 16.5 ma per hour and due to reception is 8 + 7 = 15ma per hour.
the power consumption of mica2 due to cpu processing,  transmission and reception are approximately 8.0 ma, 7.0 ma and 8.5 ma per hour respectively [18], and the capacity of an alkaline battery is 2500mah.
since, each record is 16 bytes long, it will take 0.34 seconds to transmit 50 records and another 0.34  seconds to receive 50 records over a 19200 bps link.
on encountering another hiker, a sensor node transmits 50 witness records and receives 50 new  witness records.
first, we assume that each sensor node carries about 100 witness records.
in this section, we provide an estimate of how long the power of a mica2 mote will last under certain assumtions.
in general, the amount of memory needed and power consumption depends on a variety of factors such as node density, number of hiker encounters, and the number of  access points.
a sensor is constrained in the amount of memory and power.
