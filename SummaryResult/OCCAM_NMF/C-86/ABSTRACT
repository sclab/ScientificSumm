finally, we propose refinements to the system"s current  auction scheme to mitigate the strategies observed to date and also comment on some initial steps toward building an  approximately strategyproof repeated combinatorial auction.
based on these results, we present a set of key challenges for market-based resource  allocation systems based on repeated combinatorial auctions.
in particular, we focus on observed strategic user behavior over a four-month period in which 312,148 node hours were  allocated across 11 research projects.
mirage allocates time on a heavily-used 148-node wireless sensor network testbed.
towards this end, we present our initial experience using  mirage, a microeconomic resource allocation system based on a repeated combinatorial auction.
while market-based systems have long been proposed as  solutions for distributed resource allocation, few have been deployed for production use in real computer systems.
