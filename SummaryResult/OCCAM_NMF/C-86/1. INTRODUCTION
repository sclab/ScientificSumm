finally, in section 5, we conclude the paper. 
as a first step in  addressing some of these challenges, we describe refinements to mirage"s current auction scheme that mitigate the  strategies observed to date and also comment on some initial steps towards building an approximately strategyproof repeated combinatorial auction for mirage.
based on these results, section 4 presents a set of key  challenges for market-based resource allocation systems based on repeated combinatorial auctions.
in section 3, we examine strategic user behavior, focusing on the four  primary types of strategies employed by users in the system.
in section 2, 99 we present an overview of mirage including high-level  observations on usage over a four-month period.
the rest of this paper is organized as follows.
the key contribution of this paper is an analysis of such strategic behavior as observed over a four-month time period and proposed refinements for mitigating such  behavior en route to building an approximately strategyproof  repeated combinatorial auction.
deploying a non-strategyproof mechanism also had the benefit of testing rationality and seeing how and to what extent users would try to game the system.
we made this decision mainly  because designing a strategyproof mechanism remains an open, challenging problem and we wanted to deploy a working  system and gain experience with real users to address our three goals in a timely manner.
that is, self-interested users could attempt to increase their  personal gain, at the expense of others, by not revealing their true value to the system.
in deploying mirage, we made the early decision to base the system on a repeated combinatorial auction known not to be strategyproof.
empirical results based on four months of usage have  validated the key motivating factors in using an auction-based scheme (i.e., significant resource contention and widely  varying valuations) but have also pointed to real-world  observations of strategic user behavior.
the third is left for future work.
in this paper, we report briefly on our first goal while focusing primarily on the second.
finally, we wanted to identify what other practical problems would emerge in a deployment of a market based system.
with mirage, we wanted to observe to what extent rationality held and in what ways users would attempt to strategize and game the system.
much of economic theory is predicated on rational user behavior, which forms the basis for motivating research efforts such as strategyproof  mechanism design [4, 6, 15, 16, 19].
second, we wanted to observe how users would actually behave in a market-based environment.
therefore, a key goal was to first measure both resource  contention and the range of underlying valuations users place on the resources during periods of resource scarcity.
an  economic problem only exists when resources are scarce.
first, we wanted to validate whether a market-based resource allocation scheme was necessary at all.
in designing and deploying mirage, we had three primary goals.
the system, which employs a repeated  combinatorial auction [5, 14] to schedule allocations, has been in production use for over four months and has scheduled over 312,148 node hours across 11 research projects to date.
towards this end, we have designed,  implemented, and deployed a microeconomic resource allocation system called mirage [3] for scheduling testbed time on a 148-node wireless sensor network (sensornet) testbed at  intel research.
yet, while the theoretical  underpinnings of market-based schemes have made significant strides in recent years, practical integration of market-based mechanisms into real computer systems and empirical  observations of such systems under real workloads has remained an elusive goal.
market-based systems have long been proposed as  solutions for resource allocation in distributed systems including computational grids [2, 20], wide-area network testbeds [9], and peer-to-peer systems [17].
