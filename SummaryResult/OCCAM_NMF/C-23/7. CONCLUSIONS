we also discussed the re-combination cost and provided an effective scheme for reducing it. 
experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving transfer time and reducing overall idle time spent waiting for the slowest server.
in this approach, the workloads of selected replica servers are continuously adjusted during data transfers, and we provide a function that enables users to define a final 803 block threshold, according to their data grid environment.
we proposed the recursive-adjustment co-allocation scheme to improve data transfer performances using the co-allocation architecture in [17].
however, it cannot handle the idle time of faster servers, which must wait for the slowest server to deliver its final block.
a previous work showed that the dynamic co-allocation scheme leads to performance improvements.
the co-allocation architecture provides a coordinated agent for assigning data blocks.
