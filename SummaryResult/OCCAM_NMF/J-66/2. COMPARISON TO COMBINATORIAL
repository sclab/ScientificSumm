in order to achieve the full economic  efficiency allowed by the market"s expressiveness (or even come close to it), hard computational problems must be solved in combinatorial auctions and exchanges, as well as in the charity donation market (as we will see).
another parallel is the computational complexity of the clearing problem.
again, expressive bidding is necessary to achieve economic efficiency.
this may allow bidders to negotiate a complex arrangement of who gives how much to which charity, which is beneficial to all  parties involved; whereas no such arrangement may have been possible if the bidders had been restricted to using simple matching offers on individual charities.
here, bidders can  express exactly how much they are willing to donate for every vector of amounts donated to charities.
expressive bidding is also one of the main benefits of the expressive charity donation market.
in this scenario, the bidder may win the first item but not the second (because there was another high bid on the second item that she did not anticipate), leading to economic inefficiency.
compare this to a bidder having to bid on two different items in two different (one-item) auctions, without any way of expressing that (for instance) one item is worthless if the other item is not won.
a bidder can express exactly how much each different allocation is worth to her, and thus the globally optimal allocation may be chosen by the  auctioneer.
one of the main reasons for the interest in combinatorial auctions and exchanges is that it allows for expressive bidding.
nevertheless, there are  interesting parallels.
the problems of clearing expressive charity donation  markets and clearing combinatorial auctions or exchanges are very different in formulation.
combinatorial auctions and exchanges have recently become a popular research topic [20, 21, 17, 22, 9, 18, 13, 3, 12, 26, 19, 25, 2].
other extensions include allowing for side constraints, as well as the specification of attributes of the items in bids.
variants include combinatorial reverse auctions, where the auctioneer is seeking to procure a set of items; and  combinatorial exchanges, where bidders can both buy and and sell items (even within the same bid).
(this is known as the clearing problem.)
the auctioneer subsequently labels each bid as winning or losing, under the constraint that no item can be in more than one winning bid, to maximize the sum of the values of the winning bids.
in a combinatorial auction, there are m items for sale, and bidders can place bids on bundles of one or more items.
it can be skipped, but may be of interest to the reader with a background in combinatorial auctions and exchanges.
