the techniques presented in this paper will typically generalize to objectives that take the bids into account directly. 
2 in general, the objective function may also depend on the bids, but the objective functions under consideration in this paper do not depend on the bids.
this is the topic of the next section.
how difficult the donation-clearing problem is  depends on the types of bids used and the language in which they are expressed.
we are asked to find an objective-maximizing valid outcome.
additionally, we are given an objective function.
, cm.
we are given a set of n bids over charities c1, c2, .
definition 4 (donation-clearing).
the formal definition follows.
we will refer to it as the clearing problem.
finding the valid outcome that maximizes the objective is a (nontrivial) computational problem.
(here, different weights could also be placed on the different charities.)
another objective is total amount  donated, given by m i=1 πci .
the surplus could be the profits of a company managing the expressive donation marketplace; but,  alternatively, the surplus could be returned to the bidders, or given to the charities.
one example of an objective is surplus, given by n j=1 πbj − m i=1 πci .
definition 3. an objective is a function from the set of all outcomes to r.2 after all bids have been collected, a valid outcome will be chosen that maximizes this objective.
we choose the valid outcome that maximizes the objective that we have for the donation process.
of course, in the end, only one of the valid outcomes can be chosen.
, πcm ) (no bidder gives more than she is willing to).
a valid  outcome is an outcome where 1. n j=1 πbj ≥ m i=1 πci (at least as much money is collected as is given away); 2. for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n, πbj ≤ vj(πc1 , πc2 , .
, πcm ).
, πbn ), and a vector of payments received by the charities (πc1 , πc2 , .
definition 2. an outcome is a vector of payments made by the bidders (πb1 , πb2 , .
we now define possible outcomes in our model, and which outcomes are valid given the bids that were made.
, cm, a bid by bidder bj is a function vj : rm → r. the  interpretation is that if charity ci receives a total amount of πci , then bidder j is willing to donate (up to) vj(πc1 , πc2 , .
definition 1. in a setting with m charities c1, c2, .
the following definition makes the general form of a bid in our framework precise.
the bidding language is expressive enough that no bidder should have to make more than one bid.
(the contribution of this bidder is also counted in the vector of  paymentsso, the vector of total payments to the charities represents the amount given by all donating parties, not just the ones other than this bidder.)
in our bidding framework, a bid will specify, for each vector of total payments made to the charities, how much that bidder is willing to contribute.
throughout this paper, we will refer to the offers that the donating parties make as bids, and to the donating parties as bidders.
