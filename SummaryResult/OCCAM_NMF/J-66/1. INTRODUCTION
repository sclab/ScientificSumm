aditionally, optimally solving the clearing problem (and thereby generating the maximum economic welfare) requires the application of sophisticated algorithms. 
a web-based implementation of the ideas described in this paper can facilitate voluntary reallocation of wealth on a global scale.
in short, expressive negotiation over donations to charities is a new way in which electronic commerce can help the world.
towards the end of the paper, we also study the  mechanism design problem of motivating the bidders to bid  truthfully.
for example, the american red cross liberty  disaster fund maintains a list of businesses that match their customers" donations [8].
1 typically, larger organizations match offers of private  individuals.
a large part of this paper is devoted to  studying how difficult this problem is under different assumptions on the structure of the offers, and providing algorithms for solving it.
however, as we will show, finding this solution (the  clearing problem) requires solving a potentially difficult  optimization problem.
given each combination of (conditional) offers, there is a (usually) unique solution which determines how much each party pays, and how much each charity is paid.
finally, there is a clear  interpretation of what it means when multiple parties are making conditional offers that are stated in terms of each other.
moreover, the amount the party offers to donate at different levels of appreciation is allowed to vary arbitrarily (it does need to be a dollar-for-dollar (or  n-dollarfor-dollar) matching arrangement, or an arrangement where the party offers a fixed amount provided a given (strike) total has been exceeded).
in contrast, in this paper we propose a new approach where each party can express its relative preferences for  different charities, and make its offer conditional on its own appreciation for the vector of donations made to the  different charities.
(thus, a total payment of $500 to charity a combined with a total payment of $1000 to charity b would be just enough for the party"s offer to take effect.)
for instance, a party may wish to specify that it will pay $100 given that charity a receives a total of $1000, but that it will also count donations made to charity b, at half the rate.
thus, matching offers can only be based on payments made by  parties that are giving unconditionally (not in terms of a matching offer)-or at least there can be no circular dependencies.1 2. given the current infrastructure for making matching offers, it is impractical to make a matching offer  depend on the amounts given to multiple charities.
(for example, it is not clear what the outcome should be when both parties offer to match the other"s donation.)
1. it is not clear how two parties can make matching  offers where each party"s offer is stated in terms of the amount that the other pays.
however, there are several severe limitations to the simple approach of matching offers as just described.
as a real-world example, the united states government has authorized a donation of up to $1 billion to the global fund to fight aids, tb and malaria, under the condition that the american contribution does not exceed one third of the total-to encourage other countries to give more [23].
thus this matching offer implements the contract suggested above.
examples of matching offers are: i will give x dollars for every dollar donated., or i will give x dollars if the total collected from other parties exceeds y. in our example above, one of the parties can make the offer i will donate $0.5 if the other party also donates at least that much, and the other party will have an incentive to indeed donate $0.5, so that the total amount given to the charity increases by $1.
51 one method that is often used to effect this is to make a matching offer.
effectively, each party has made its donation conditional on the other party"s donation, leading to larger donations and greater happiness to all parties involved.
however, if the two parties draw up a contract that says that they will each give $0.5, both the parties have an incentive to accept this contract (rather than have no contract at all): with the contract, the charity will receive $1 (rather than $0  without a contract), which is worth $0.75 to each party, which is greater than the $0.5 that that party will have to give.
it follows neither of them will be  willing to give unconditionally, because $0.75 < $1.
suppose we have two parties, 1 and 2, who are both  supporters of charity a. to either of them, it would be worth $0.75 if a received $1.
the  following example will illustrate this, and show that the donating parties as well as the charitable cause may simultaneously benefit from the potential for such negotiation.
this is done by making the donation conditional on the others" donations.
in such scenarios, it is sensible for a party to use its contemplated donation as negotiating material to  induce the others to give more.
however, when multiple parties support the same charity, each of them would prefer to see the others give more rather than less to this charity.
indeed, this is  currently often the only way to make a donation, especially for small donating parties such as private individuals.
when money is donated to a charitable (or other) cause (hereafter referred to as charity), often the donating party gives unconditionally: a fixed amount is transferred from the donator to the charity, and none of this transfer is  contingent on other events-in particular, it is not contingent on the amount given by other parties.
