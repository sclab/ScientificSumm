finally, are there good iterative mechanisms for charity donation?6 
much crucial work remains to be done on the mechanism design problem.
it is also 59 important to identify other classes of bids (besides concave ones) for which the clearing problem is tractable.
another is to study the  computational scalability of our mip/lp approach.
one is to build a web-based implementation of the (first-price)  mechanism proposed in this paper.
there are many directions for future research.
we also showed that even though the clearing problem  decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.
we showed that an ex-post efficient mechanism is impossible even with only one charity and a very restricted class of bids.
for the quasilinear setting, we studied the  mechanism design question of making the bidders report their preferences truthfully rather than strategically.
subsequently, we showed that the clearing problem is much easier when bids are quasilinear (where payment willingness functions are linear)-for surplus, the problem decomposes across charities, and for payment maximization, a greedy approach is optimal if the bids are concave (although this latter problem is weakly np-complete when the bids are not concave).
we then showed that the clearing problem for a subclass of concave bids is at least as hard as the decision variant of  linear programming, suggesting that we cannot do much better than a linear programming implementation for such bids.
we gave a mixed-integer program formulation of the clearing problem, and showed that for concave bids (where utility functions and payment willingness function are concave), the program reduces to a linear program and can hence be solved in polynomial time.
we  formulated the corresponding clearing problem (deciding how much each bidder pays, and how much each charity receives), and showed that it is np-complete to approximate to any  ratio even in very restricted settings.
we introduced a bidding language for expressing very  general types of matching offers over multiple charities.
