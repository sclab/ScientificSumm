in this paper, we study how to compute the optimal  strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (section 2) and in bayesian games, which are a special case of  extensiveform games (section 3). 
because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the  original game into the extensive-form representation of the  leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.
moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.
(we note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)
for example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership  situation.
the number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large.
theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a  strategy (for the original game) first.
however, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored.
a significant amount of research has recently been  devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].
of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.
for example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0. in hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely)  appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.
indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents"  actions were fixed, would be suboptimal.
mechanism design is an extremely important topic to the ec community: the papers published on  mechanism design in recent ec conferences are too numerous to cite.
finally, there is also an implicit leadership situation in the field of mechanism design, in which one player (the designer) gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining  players then play.
this holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, robosoccer), and for industrial  applications such as sensor webs.
thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.
once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.
models of leadership are especially important in settings with multiple self-interested software agents.
in this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to  commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome.
being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example,  committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other player"s decision will naturally result in a loss).
in general, if  commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].
perhaps the  earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von stackelberg [25], who showed that, in cournot"s duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a  production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (nash) solution.
for example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.
such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.
for example, one of the players may  arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing  busi82 ness).
this can be due to a  variety of reasons.
oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).
however, in many real-world settings, strategies are not selected in such a simultaneous manner.
this leads to refinements of nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)
(typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have  received so far.
because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each player"s strategy is a best response to the others" strategies.
nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.
when the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some  information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.
this leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.
a (mixed-strategy) nash  equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple nash equilibria.
(typically, the strategies are  allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)
a nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies.
given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is  typically analyzed using the concept of nash equilibrium.
this is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agent"s utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.
typically, when a strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game  theory, it is assumed that players choose their strategies  simultaneously.
to analyze how an agent should behave in such settings, the tools of game theory need to be applied.
in multiagent systems with self-interested agents  (including most economic settings), the optimal action for one agent to take depends on the actions that the other agents take.
