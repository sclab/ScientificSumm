acknowledgments we would like to dedicate this paper to all of the participants in cs 286r at harvard university in spring 2004. this work is supported in part by nsf grant iis-0238147. 
in addition, we are beginning to engage in collaborations to apply the design to airline takeoff and landing slot scheduling and to resource allocation in  widearea network distributed computational systems.
we intend to study the elicitation properties of the exchange and we have put together a test suite of exchange problem instances.
the next steps for our work are to allow bidders to refine the structure of the bid tree in addition to values on the tree.
the exchange is fully implemented in java and is in a validation phase.
the  design includes many interesting features, including: a new bid-tree language for exchanges, a new method to construct approximate linear prices from expressive languages, and a proxied elicitation method with optimistic and pessimistic valuations with a new method to evaluate a revealed-  preference activity rule.
in this work we designed and prototyped a scalable and highly-expressive iterative combinatorial exchange.
