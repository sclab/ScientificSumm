this is an issue that deserves some attention in future work. 
also, no consideration has been given in this work to collusion by bidders.
for instance we do not suggest to provide αeff to bidders, because as αeff approaches 1 it would inform bidders that bid values are becoming irrelevant to determining the trade but merely used to determine payments (and bidders would become increasingly reluctant to increase their lower  valuations).
we must be careful, though.
first, we do not claim that  truthfully responding to the rp rule is an ex post equilibrium.13 however, the exchange is designed to mimic the threshold rule in its payment scheme, which is known to have  useful incentive properties [16].
some strategic aspects of our ice design deserve  comment, and further study.
future work must study convergence experimentally, and extend this theory to allow for approximate prices.
when linear ce prices exist, this provides for a soundness and completeness statement: if pp = po, linear ce prices exist, and the rp rule is satisfied, the provisional trade is efficient (soundness); if prices are exact ce prices for the provisional trade at vα , but the trade is inefficient with  respect to some valuation profile consistent with the current bid trees, then at least one bidder must fail rp with her current bid tree and progress will be made (completeness).
257 λt−1 at valuations vα , then if the upper and lower values at the start of round t already satisfy the rp rule (and without the need for any tie-breaking), the provisional trade is  efficient for all valuations consistent with the current bid trees.
the following can be easily established: given exact ce prices pt−1 for provisional trade 12 this is in contrast to indirect price-based approaches, such as clock-proxy [1], in which bidders must be able to reason about the rp-constraints implied by bids in each round.
the rp activity rule was adopted later, and is a good choice because of its excellent theoretical properties when coupled with ce prices.
the conciseness of this price representation is very important for computational tractability within the exchange and also to promote simplicity and transparency for bidders.
we adopted linear prices (prices on individual items) rather than non-linear prices (with prices on a trade not equal to the sum of the prices on the component items) early in the design process.
moreover, the use of price and rp activity provides additional guarantees.
this is worthy of experimental investigation.
nevertheless, we conjecture that pp = po will prove an excellent indicator of efficiency in practical settings where the shape of the upper and lower valuations does convey useful information.
the difference in values between  different trades, aggregated across all bidders, could be similar at lower and upper bounds but quite different at intermediate values (including truth).
note that taken by itself, pp = po does not imply that the current provisional trade is efficient with respect to all values consistent with current value information.
upper and lower bound information also provides  guidance about when to terminate.
another advantage is that it makes the activity rule easy to explain: bidders can always meet the activity rule by tightening bounds such that their true value remains in the support.12 perhaps most importantly, having explicit information on upper and lower values  permits progress in early rounds, even while there is no efficient trade at pessimistic values.
in addition, this removes much opportunity for strategic manipulation: bidders are restricted to making (incremental) statements about their valuations.
[24] and make it iterative.
in many ways this is the clearest and most immediate way to generalize the  design in parkes et al.
the decision to adopt a direct and proxied approach in which bidders express their upper and lower values to a trusted proxy agent that interacts with the exchange was made early in the design process.
it also provides for an efficient method to check the rp activity rule, because it makes it simple to reason about shared uncertainty between trades.
11 http://econcs.eecs.harvard.edu/jopt this allows the language itself to ensure consistency (with the upper value at least the lower value on all trades) and enforce monotonic tightening of these bounds for all trades across rounds.

10 code size is measured in physical source line of code (sloc), as generated using david a. wheeler"s sloc count.
for simplicity, we require the same tree structure for both the upper and lower valuations.
the breakthrough came when we  focused on changes in value for trades rather than providing absolute values for allocations.
this proved especially challenging.
the bidding language was defined to allow for perfect  symmetry between buyers and sellers and provide expressiveness in an exchange domain, for instance for mixed bidders  interested in executing trades such as swaps.
