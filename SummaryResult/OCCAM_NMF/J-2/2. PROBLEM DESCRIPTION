we do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi; because of this, ai"s  incentives are unaffected by this redistribution payment, and the mechanism remains strategy-proof. 
after running the original vcg mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribution payment.
we modify the mechanism as follows.
when m = 1, this is the second-price or vickrey auction.
thus, the total vcg payment equals mˆvm+1.
, am wins a unit, and pays ˆvm+1 for this unit.
under the vcg mechanism, each agent among a1, .
given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.
≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. let vi denote the true value of ai.
, an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ .
let the set of agents be {a1, a2, .
(this assumption is not harmful: in environments where anyone can join the auction, running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway, because everyone would want to join to collect part of the redistribution.)
we also assume that m and n are always known.
we only consider the case where m < n (otherwise the problem becomes trivial).
let n denote the number of agents, and let m denote the number of units.
