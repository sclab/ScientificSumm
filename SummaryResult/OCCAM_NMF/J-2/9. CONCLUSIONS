nevertheless, it seems likely that future research will continue to  investigate mechanism design for the worst case, and hopefully a coherent framework will emerge. 
it does not appear that there are direct connections between our work and these other works that focus on designing  mechanisms that perform well in the worst case.
such work often also takes a worst-case competitive analysis approach [14, 13].
there has also been growing interest in the design of online mechanisms [7] where the agents arrive over time and decisions must be taken before all the agents have arrived.
[9, 1, 15, 8]).
some more recent papers have focused on designing  mechanisms for profit maximization using worst-case competitive analysis (e.g.
traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on  designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the vcg mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents" preferences (such as the myerson auction [20] and the maskin-riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).
this work is part of a growing literature on designing mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case.
if this bid wins, the colluders must allocate the item amongst themselves, perhaps using payments-but of course they do not want payments to flow out of the ring.
for example, in a typical collusive scheme, there is a bidding ring  consisting of a number of colluders, who submit only a single bid [10, 17].
another direction for future research is to consider whether this mechanism has applications to collusion.
alternatively, one can try to identify other special settings in which positive redistribution in the worst case is possible.
however, it turns out that in sufficiently general settings, the worst-case optimal redistribution percentage is 0. in such settings, the worst-case criterion provides no guidance in determining a good redistribution mechanism (even redistributing nothing achieves the optimal worst-case percentage), so it becomes necessary to pursue other criteria.
one important direction for future research is to try to extend these results beyond multi-unit auctions with unit demand.
finally, we proved that the obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous  deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties.
we gave both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting  mechanism shows significant improvement over the bailey-cavallo mechanism (in the worst case).
we then provided an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and showed how to cast this model as a linear  program.
the family includes the bailey-cavallo mechanism as a special case.
all mechanisms in the family are  efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit.
here we proposed a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the vcg payment 38 back to the agents.
(for this specific setting, cavallo"s mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by bailey in 1997 [2].)
we studied allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a  single good, and agents have unit demand.
in this paper, we extended this  result in a restricted setting.
in 2006,  cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the vcg payment back to the agents, while maintaining  efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property.
however, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among  themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents.
however, the vcg mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents" payments will sum to more than 0. if there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus  payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer.
for allocation problems with one or more items, the  wellknown vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg) mechanism is efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and does not incur a deficit.
