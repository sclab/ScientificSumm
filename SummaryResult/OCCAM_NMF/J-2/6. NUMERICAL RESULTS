when n > m + 2, the worst-case  optimal mechanism outperforms the bailey-cavallo mechanism (in the worst case). 
, 30. these results are in figure 1. we see that for any m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as the bailey-cavallo mechanism (actually, in this case, the worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the  baileycavallo mechanism).
finally, we compare the worst-case optimal mechanism to the bailey-cavallo mechanism for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, n = m + 2, .
hence, the percentage of the total vcg payment that is not  redistributed is never more than 4 15 = 26.7%.
the total amount redistributed is 11 15 ˆv2 + 4 15 ˆv3 − 4 15 ˆv4 + 4 15 ˆv5; in the worst case, 11 15 ˆv2 is redistributed.
that is, the redistribution payment received by each agent is: 11 45 times the second highest bid among the other agents, minus 1 9 times the third highest bid among the other agents, plus 1 15 times the fourth highest bid among the other agents.
by solving the above linear program, we find that the optimal values for the ci are c2 = 11 45 , c3 = −1 9 , and c4 = 1 15 .
let us present the optimal solution for the case n = 5 in detail.
for n = 20, this is 5.26e − 3, whereas the remaining percentage for the worst-case optimal mechanism is 3.62e−5 in the worst case.
so, the expected value of the remaining percentage is 2 n − 2 n n−2 n−1 = 2 n(n−1) .
now, e ˆv3 ˆv2 = r 1 0 r ˆv2 0 ˆv3 ˆv2 f(ˆv3, ˆv2)dˆv3dˆv2 = n−2 n−1 .
the theory of order statistics tells us that the 34 joint probability density function of ˆv2 and ˆv3 is f(ˆv3, ˆv2) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)ˆvn−3 3 (1 − ˆv2) for ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3.
suppose the bid values are drawn from a uniform distribution over [0, 1].
hence the percentage of the total vcg payment that is not redistributed is ˆv2− 2 n ˆv3− n−2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 , which has an expected value of e( 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 ) = 2 n − 2 n e ˆv3 ˆv2 .
for the single-unit case, this simplifies to 2 n ˆv3 + n−2 n ˆv2.
recall that the total redistribution payment of the  baileycavallo mechanism is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1.
perhaps more surprisingly, the worst-case optimal mechanism sometimes does better in the worst case than the  baileycavallo mechanism does on average, as the following  example shows.

we present 1−k (the percentage of the total vcg payment that is not redistributed by the worst-case optimal  mechanism in the worst case) instead of k in the second column because writing k would require too many significant digits.
in the table below, we present the results for a single unit (m = 1).
for selected values of n and m, we solved the linear  program using glpk (gnu linear programming kit).
