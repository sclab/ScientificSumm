this would lead to a problem similar to those we discussed when the same-deadline policy is used. 
however, in a combinatorial auction, the agent does not reason about the ordering of  negotiations.
a combinatorial auction [2, 9] could be another approach to  solving the negotiation chain problem.
a mediator-based partial centralized approach has been applied to the coordination and scheduling of complex task network [8], which is different from our work since the system is a complete cooperative system and individual utility of single agent is not concerned at all.
in our work, the negotiation involves more  complicated issues such as reward, penalty and utility; also, we adopt a distribution approach where no centralized control is needed.
it models the negotiation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (dcop) and a  cooperative mediation mechanism is used to centralize relevant portions of the dcop.
mailler and lesser [4] have presented an  approach to a distributed resource allocation problem where the  negotiation chain scenario occurs.
however, this work is limited since it only involves a single agent"s perspective without any understanding that the agent may be part of a negotiation chain.
fatima, wooldridge and jennings [1] studied the multiple issues in negotiation in terms of the agenda and negotiation procedure.
