section 3 introduces a complex supply-chain scenario.
section 2 describes the basic negotiation process and briefly reviews a single agent"s model of multi-linked  negotiation.
the remainder of this paper is structured in the  following manner.
in this paper we extend a multi-linked negotiation model [10] from a single-agent perspective to a multi-agent perspective, so that a group of agents involved in chains of interrelated negotiations can find nearly-optimal macro negotiation strategies for pursuing their negotiations.
these macro-strategies are different from those micro-strategies that direct the individual negotiation thread, such as whether the agent should concede and how much the agent should concede, etc[3].
the goal of this research is to  develop a set of macro-strategies that allow the agents to effectively manage multiple related negotiations, including, but not limited to the following issues: how much time should be spent on each  negotiation, how much flexibility (see formal definition in formula 3) should be allocated for each negotiation, and in what order should 50 978-81-904262-7-5 (rps) c 2007 ifaamas the negotiations be performed.
based on this recognition, this work on negotiation is concerned more about the meta-level decision-making process in negotiation rather than the basic protocols or languages.
rather it is one part of the agent"s activity which is tightly interleaved with the planning, scheduling and executing of the agent"s activities, which also may relate to other negotiations.
another major difference between this work and other work on negotiation is that negotiation, here, is not viewed as a stand-alone process.
in such systems, agents are self-interested because they primarily focus on their own goals; but they are also semi-cooperative, meaning they are willing to be truthful and  collaborate with other agents to find solutions that are beneficial to all participants, including itself; though it won"t voluntarily scarify its own utility in exchange of others" benefits.
reputation mechanisms in the system makes  cheating not attractive from a long term viewpoint due to multiple  encounters among agents.
other factors like quality and delivery time are important too.
in such negotiations, price may or may not be important, since it can be fixed resulting from a long-term contract.
additionally, there are multiple encounters among agents since new tasks are arriving all the time.
the negotiation in such systems is not a zero-sum game, a deal that increases both agents" utilities can be found through efficient  negotiation.
meanwhile, the  performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agents"  cooperation and the virtual organization"s overall performance.
there is no single global goal since each agent may be involved in multiple virtual organizations.
to accomplish tasks continuously arriving in the virtual organization, cooperation and sub-task relocation are needed and preferred.
a supply chain) dynamically formed in an electronic marketplace such as the one developed by the conoise project [5].
an example of such a system would be a virtual organization [12] (i.e.
this issue arises due to multiple concurrent tasks, resource  constrains and uncertainties, and thus no agent has sufficient  knowledge or computational resources to determine what is best for the whole system [11].
there is no single global goal in such systems,  either because each agent represents a different organization/user, or because it is difficult/impossible to design one single global goal.
this work is aimed at semi-cooperative multi-agent systems, where each agent has its own goals and works to maximize its  local utility; however, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agent"s cooperation and the system"s overall performance.
this is an important research area where there has been very little work done.
groups of agents need to efficiently negotiate over multiple related issues concurrently in a complex, distributed setting where there are deadlines by which the negotiations must be completed.
sophisticated negotiation for task and resource allocation is  crucial for the next generation of multi-agent systems (mas)  applications.
