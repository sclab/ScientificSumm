Also, in the design of search systems it implies that since different types of RF may be appropriate for different task complexities then a system that could automatically detect complexity could use both ERF and IRF simultaneously to benefit the searcher.
The results also show the effects of task complexity on the IRF process and how rapidly subjects reach their most interactive point.
However , IRF was generally liked by both subject groups ( perhaps because it removed the burden of providing relevance information ) and ERF was generally preferred by experienced subjects more than inexperienced subjects ( perhaps because
