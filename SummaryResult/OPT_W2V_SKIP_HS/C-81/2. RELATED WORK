The first work to take environmental energy into account for data routing was [17], followed by [18].
While several energy harvesting sensor node platforms have been prototyped [14], [15], [16], there is a need for systematic power management techniques that provide performance guarantees during system operation.
Energy harvesting has been explored for several different types of systems, such as wearable computers [4], [5], [6], sensor networks [7], etc.
Several technologies to extract energy from the environment have been demonstrated including solar, motion-based, biochemical, vibration-based [8], [9], [10], [11], and others are being developed [12], [13].
While these works did demonstrate
