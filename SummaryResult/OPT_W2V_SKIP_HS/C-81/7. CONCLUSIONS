Specifically, we designed a method for optimizing performance subject to the constraint of energy neutral operation.
It is designed for a specific power scaling method based on adapting the duty cycle.
Our method has significant advantages over currently used methods which are based on a conservative estimate of duty cycle and can only provide sub-optimal performance.
However, this work is only the first step towards optimal solutions for energy neutral operation.
It is thus of interest to extend our methods to exploit these advanced capabilities. 
Several other power scaling methods , such as DVS , submodule power switching and the
