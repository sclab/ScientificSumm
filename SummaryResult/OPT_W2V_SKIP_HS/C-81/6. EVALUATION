The battery efficiency was varied from 0.5 to 1 on the x-axis and solar energy utilizations achieved by the three algorithms are shown on the y-axis.
These results are shown in Table 1 as the percentage of energy saved by the optimal and adaptive approaches, and this is the energy which would normally be wasted in the simple approach.
For the simple approach , the duty cycle is kept constant within each day and is Figure 4 Solar Energy Profile ( Left : Continuous , Right : Diurnal ) Input : D : Initial duty cycle , X : Excess
