The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction  accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts.
For LinOP, increasing the number of experts in  general increases or keeps the same the level of prediction accuracy.
Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and  LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance  measures across all 210 games.
When there are more than 500 experts , increasing number of experts used in LogOP improves the prediction accuracy measured by absolute error , but worsens the accuracy measured by
