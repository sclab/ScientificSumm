Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open  discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.
They are combined through various  mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability  distribution.
In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation  function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.
Using LinOP , the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions : p ( Î¸ ) = n i=1
