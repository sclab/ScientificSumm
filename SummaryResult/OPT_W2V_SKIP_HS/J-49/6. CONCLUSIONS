We have selected four opinion pools to represent the prediction accuracy level that LinOP and LogOP can achieve.
In screening for representative opinion pools to compare with information markets, we investigate the effect of weights and number of experts on prediction accuracy.
It is quite robust in the sense that even if the included individual predictions are less accurate, averaging over all opinions still gives better (or equally good) predictions.
In this paper , we compare prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and logarithmic opinion pools ( LinOP and LogOP ) using predictions from two markets and 1966 individuals
