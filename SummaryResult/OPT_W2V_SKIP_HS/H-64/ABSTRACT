This paper describes ongoing research into the application of machine learning techniques for improving access to  governmental information in complex digital libraries.
Under the auspices of the GovStat Project, our goal is to identify a small number of semantically valid concepts that adequately spans the intellectual domain of a collection.
First we desire a practical aid for  information architects.
Second, automatically derived  documentconcept relationships are a necessary precondition for  realworld deployment of many dynamic interfaces.
