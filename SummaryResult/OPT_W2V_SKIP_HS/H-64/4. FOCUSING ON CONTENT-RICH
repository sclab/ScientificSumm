As described in [12], the goal of cluster analysis is to assign each of the n observations to one of a small number k groups, each of which is characterized by high intra-cluster correlation and low inter-cluster correlation.
However, 80 clusters are far too many for application to an interface such as the relation 5 We have focused on k-means as opposed to other clustering algorithms for several reasons.
However, k-means clustering requires that the  researcher specify k, the number of clusters to define.
In consultation with employees of the BLS , we continued our analysis on documents that form
