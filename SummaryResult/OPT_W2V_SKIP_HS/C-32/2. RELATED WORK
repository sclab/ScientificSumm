In contrast, BuddyCache uses application level multicast and a sender-reliable  coherence protocol to provide similar access latency  improvements for transactional objects.
Multiprocessor systems and distributed shared memory systems [14, 4, 17, 18, 5] use fine-grain coherence techniques to avoid the performance penalty of false sharing but do not address issues of availability when nodes fail.
Cooperative caching techniques [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] provide access to client caches to avoid high disk access latency in an environment where servers and clients run on a fast local area network.
The  protocol exploits application specific methods e.g.
These techniques use the server
