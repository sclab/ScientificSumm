One challenge is how to provide efficient access to shared  finegrained objects in the collaborative group without imposing performance overhead on the entire caching system.
The performance problem facing the collaborative application is coordinating with the servers consistent access to shared objects.
For transactional storage systems, the high cost of wide-area network interactions to maintain data consistency is the main cost limiting the performance and therefore, in wide-area network environments, collaborative applications have been adapted to use weaker consistency storage systems [22].
