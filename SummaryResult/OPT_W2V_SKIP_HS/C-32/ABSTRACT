The challenge is to improve performance while providing the correctness and availability properties of a transactional caching protocol in the presence of node failures and slow peers.
These properties are difficult to provide in wide-area networks  because of high network latency.
BuddyCache is a new transactional caching approach that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for collaborative strong-consistency applications in  high-latency network environments.
Collaborative applications provide a shared work  environment for groups of networked clients collaborating on a  common task.
They require strong consistency for shared  persistent data and efficient access to fine-grained objects.
