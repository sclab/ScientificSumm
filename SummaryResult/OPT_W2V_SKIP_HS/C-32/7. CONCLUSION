We have designed and implemented BuddyCache  prototype in Thor distributed transactional object storage  system [23] and evaluated the benefits and costs of the system over a range of network latencies.
This paper described BuddyCache, a new transactional  cooperative caching [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] technique that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for  collaborative strong-consistency applications in high-latency  network environments.
The technique improves performance yet provides strong correctness and availability properties in the presence of node failures and slow clients.
The main contributions of the paper are : 1. extending cooperative caching techniques to support 37 fine-grain
