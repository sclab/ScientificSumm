To do this, we will require our third and final category of monitor: A contractible monitor is simply a verifiable monitor that generates proofs that can serve as input to a contract.
The two possibilities for monitor correspond to which node has the burden of proof.
It involves the source sharing the proofs it generates with nodes further down the path, which use them to determine bilateral payments.
This means that node i (or possibly its children) will have to combine the proofs that they receive to generate a proof of the rest of path quality.
Proof : Because nodes
