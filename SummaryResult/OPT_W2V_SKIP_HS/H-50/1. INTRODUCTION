Several studies argued that rank aggregation has the  potential of combining effectively all the various sources of  evidence considered in various input methods.
The result lists produced by these approaches depend on the  exact definition of the relevance concept.
The rank aggregation problem was addressed in various fields such as i) in social choice theory which studies  voting algorithms which specify winners of elections or winners of competitions in tournaments [29], ii) in statistics when studying correlation between rankings, iii) in distributed databases when results from different databases must be combined [12], and iv) in collaborative filtering [23].
