5.2.3 Impact of the Variation of the Number of Input Rankings To study performance evolution when different sets of  input rankings are considered, we carried three more runs where 2, 4, and 6 of the best performing sets of the  input rankings are considered.
For the comparisons, we  considered a specific outranking relation Sâˆ— = S(5%,50%,50%,30%) which results in good overall performances when tuning all the parameters.
Therefore , whether we consider all the documents which are present in half of the rankings ( mcm24 ) or we consider all the documents which are ranked in the
