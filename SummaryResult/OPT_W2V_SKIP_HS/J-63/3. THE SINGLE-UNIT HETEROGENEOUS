It is left to prove (9) when j is not matched to i in ( ˆT−k )∗ .
Consider a pair of buyer j and seller i which are matched in the optimal allocation T ∗ .
Consider a buyer j who is matched with seller i according to his true valuation v. Consider that j is reporting instead a false valuation ˆv which results in a different allocation in which j is matched with seller k = i.
Since all sellers in this path are matched in ( ˆT−k ) ∗ , we have that seller k does not belong to P. Since
