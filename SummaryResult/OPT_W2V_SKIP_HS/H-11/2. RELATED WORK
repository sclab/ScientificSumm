The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental design are: • D-optimal design: determinant of Hsse.
2.1 The Active Learning Problem The generic problem of active learning is the following.
Thus, the maximum likelihood estimate for the weight vector, ˆw, is that which minimizes the sum squared error Jsse(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 (2) The estimate ˆw gives us an estimate of the output at a novel input: ˆy = ˆwT x.
2.2 Optimal Experimental Design We consider a linear regression model y = wT x + (
