For SVMactive, AOD, and LOD, the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms.
It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system.
It is important to note that the automatic relevance  feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in [8], [11].
Clearly, the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set.
Therefore, the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important.
10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the
