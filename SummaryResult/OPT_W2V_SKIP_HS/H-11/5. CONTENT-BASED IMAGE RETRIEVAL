Since robust and accurate image segmentation is difficult to achieve, the use of shape features for image retrieval has been limited to special applications where objects or regions are readily available.
Then CTM calculates the first and second moment of these maps as a representation of the natural color image pixel distribution.
We begin with a brief description of image representation using low level visual features.
The  classifier is then used to re-rank the images in database.
Traditionally, the user"s relevance feedbacks are used to update the query vector or adjust the weighting of different dimensions.
CTM adopts
