In statistics, the problem of selecting samples to label is typically referred to as experimental design.
However, this kind of approaches takes only measured (or, labeled) data into account in their objective function, while the unmeasured (or, unlabeled) data is ignored.
In the worst case, all the top images labeled by the user may be positive and thus the standard classification techniques can not be applied due to the lack of negative examples.
Based on the observation that the closer to the SVM boundary an image is , the less reliable its classification is , SVM active learning selects those
