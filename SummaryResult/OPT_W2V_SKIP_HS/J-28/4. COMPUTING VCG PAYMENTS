To compute C(I \ i), we iterate over all the possible midrange  tuples and use the corresponding forward and backward tables to compute the locally optimal solution using the above scheme.
This will be a component in computing an approximation to C(I \ i), the value of the solution to the generalized knapsack without bids from agent i.
The most expensive step in the algorithm is computation of C(I \ i).
In this section , we show that our approximation scheme for the generalized knapsack can be extended to determine all n payments in total time O ( Î±T log
