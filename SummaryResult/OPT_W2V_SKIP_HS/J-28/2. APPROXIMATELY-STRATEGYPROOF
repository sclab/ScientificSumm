In addition, the VCG mechanism is allocatively-efficient, and the payments from each buyer are always positive.3 Moreover, each buyer pays less than its value, and receives payoff V (I)−V (I \ i) in equilibrium; this is precisely the marginal-value that buyer i contributes to the economic efficiency of the system.
determination problem in the reverse auction is to determine the allocation, x∗ , that minimizes the cost to the buyer, or forfeits trade if the minimal cost is greater than value, V .
Given a set of bids from I agents , let V ( I ) denote the maximal revenue to
