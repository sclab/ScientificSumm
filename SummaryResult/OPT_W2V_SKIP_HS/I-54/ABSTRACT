Then, we analyse their time  complexity and show that finding the equilibrium offers is an NP-hard problem, even in a complete information setting.
Specifically, we show that an approximate equilibrium exists for online negotiation and show that the expected difference between the optimum and the approximate is O( âˆš m) .
The agents have time constraints in the form of both deadlines and discount factors.
For such negotiations, we first obtain the  equilibrium strategies for the case where the issues for negotiation are known a priori to the parties.
Here different agents value different issues differently.
The time complexity of the
