Since the first mover is the same for all the issues, and the agents make offers alternately, the offering agent for t = n is also the same for all the m issues.
This algorithm takes the values of ka i and kb i one at a time and generates an approximate solution to the above knapsack problem.
Since the latter has time complexity linear in m , the time complexity of ONLINE-TRADEOFFA and ONLINETRADEOFFB is also linear in m. It is worth noting that , for the 0-1 knapsack problem , the lower bound on the expected difference between the
