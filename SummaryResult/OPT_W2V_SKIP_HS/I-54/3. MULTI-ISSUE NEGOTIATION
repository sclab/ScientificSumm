On the other hand, if b is the offering agent at t = n − 1, it uses APPROX-TRADEOFFB to obtain the approximate equilibrium  package.
Hence the time complexity of finding the approximate equilibrium offer for the first time period is O(nm/ 2 ).
For agent a (b), this is done by APPROX-TRADEOFFA (APPROX-TRADEOFFB).
Assume there are m = 2 issues for negotiation, the deadline for both issues is n = 2, and the discount factor for both issues for both agents is δ = 1/2.
For the package deal procedure , the problem of finding the equilibrium offers given in Theorem 1 is
