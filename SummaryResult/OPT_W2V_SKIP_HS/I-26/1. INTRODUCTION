of special importance since the transition to the asynchronous mode adds inherent complexity to the model (mainly because now each agent needs to evaluate the probabilities of having each other agent being rejected or accepted by each of the other agents it interacts with, in a multi-stage sequential process).
Here an agent can take advantage of its unique inherent filtering and information processing capabilities and its ability to efficiently (in  comparison to people) maintain concurrent interactions with several other agents at each stage of its search.
In this paper we focus on a specific class of two-sided search matching problems
