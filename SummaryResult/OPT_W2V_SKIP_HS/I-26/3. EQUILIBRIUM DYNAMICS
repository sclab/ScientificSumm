Notice that if all agents are using the same sample size, N, then the value xN resulting from solving Equation 10 by substituting k = N and xk = xN is a stable reservation value (i.e., none of the agents can benefit from changing just the value of xN ).
When c ( N ) is linear ( or convex ) , then : ( a ) When all other agents sample k potential partners over a search round , if an agent '' s expected utility of sampling k + 1 potential partners , Vk+1 ( xk+1 ) , is smaller than
