We analyze the dynamics which drive the agents" strategies towards a stable equilibrium in the new model and show that the proposed search strategy weakly dominates the one currently in use for the two-sided parallel economic search model.
The distinguishing feature of the proposed model is that the agents are not restricted to  maintaining a synchronized (instantaneous) decision protocol and can sequentially accept and reject partnerships within the same search stage.
By identifying several unique characteristics of the equilibrium we manage to efficiently bound the strategy space that needs to be explored by the agents and propose an efficient
