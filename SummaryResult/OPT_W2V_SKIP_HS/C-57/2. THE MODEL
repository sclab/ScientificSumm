The utility of agent i from strategy profile σ and his  outcome xi, ui(σ, xi), is the difference between his benefit from the outcome (Vi(xi)) and the sum of the costs of the  resources he has used: ui(σ, xi) = Vi(xi) − X e∈σi c(hσ e ) .
, n} → R+ of the congestion experienced by e. The outcome for agent i ∈ N is denoted by xi ∈ {S, F}, where S and F, respectively, indicate whether the task  execution succeeded or failed.
Agent i ∈ N chooses a strategy σi ∈ Σi which is a (
