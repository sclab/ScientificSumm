In addition, it is of  interest to develop an efficient algorithm for the computation of pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as well as discuss the social (in)efficiency of the equilibria. 
In particular, we can show the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium for  nondecreasing CGLFs also in the modified model.
We study the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria and potential functions in the presented class of games.
In this paper, we introduce and investigate congestion  settings with unreliable resources, in which the probability of a resource"s failure depends on the congestion experienced by this resource.
Both the
