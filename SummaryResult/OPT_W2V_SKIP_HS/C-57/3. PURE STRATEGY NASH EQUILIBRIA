(1) Let x be a strategy profile which is obtained from x by a (one-step) addition of some resource a ∈ M by some agent i ∈ N(x) (note that x is nearly-even).
We show below that by performing a finite series of  (onestep) addition operations on x, we obtain an even,  DSstable strategy profile y with higher congestion, that is with hy > hx = 0, in contradiction to x ∈ Σ2 .
Coupled with Lemma 7 , the following lemma shows that if σ is a nearly-even and DS-stable strategy profile , and σ is obtained from σ by a
