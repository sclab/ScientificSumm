After these investigations, we find that in all the graphs we tested, DiffusionRank (when Î³ = 1) is most robust to  manipulation both in value difference and order difference.
4 (a), we choose four trusted sets (L = 1), on which we test DiffusionRank and TrustRank, the results are denoted by DiffusionRanki and TrustRanki (i = 0, 1, 2, 3 denotes the four trusted set); in Fig.
3 stand for the numbers of newly added points, and vertical axes show the corresponding rank values of the  manipulated nodes.
The graph below it shows node 1 is being manipulated by adding new nodes A
