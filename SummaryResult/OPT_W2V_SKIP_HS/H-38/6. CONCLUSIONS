We conclude that DiffusionRank is a generalization of PageRank, which is interesting in that the heat diffusion  coefficient γ can balance the extent that we want to model the original Web graph and the extent that we want to reduce the effect of link manipulations.
For the special application of anti-manipulation,  DiffusionRank performs best both in reduction effects and in its stability among all the three algorithms. 
Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-group relations and to partition Web graph into small communities.
The experimental results show that we can actually achieve such a balance by setting γ =
