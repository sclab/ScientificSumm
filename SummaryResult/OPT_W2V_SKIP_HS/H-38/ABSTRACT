Consequently, γ is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of  preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation.
DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.
It is found empirically that , when γ = 1 , DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect
