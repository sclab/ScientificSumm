For such f(0) in a random graph, we can find the heat distribution at time 1 by using Eq.
Formally the DiffusionRank is described in  Algorithm 1, in which,the element Uij in the inverse transition matrix U is defined to be 1/Ij if there is a link from i to j, and 0 otherwise.
When γ = 0 , the ranking value is most robust to manipulation since no heat is diffused and the system is unchangeable , but the Web structure is completely ignored since eγR f ( 0 ) = e0R f ( 0 ) =
