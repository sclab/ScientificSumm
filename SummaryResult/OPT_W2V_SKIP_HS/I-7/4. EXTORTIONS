For the type of conditional commitments we have that any  conditional commitment profile f is an extortion of order 0 and an  extortion of an order m greater than 0 is any extortion of order m − 1 for which: gπ1 , .
A benign  backward induction of order 0 is any conditional commitment profile f subject to π.
, xπn ) is a τ-extortion in G given π if and only if there is some benign backward induction f in G∗ given πR with f = (xπn , .
For the induction step, consider an arbitrary commitment profile (yπ1 , .
A conditional commitment profile f is a
