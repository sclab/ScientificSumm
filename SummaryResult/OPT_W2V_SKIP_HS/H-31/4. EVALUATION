Clearly, using K-Mixture to model the background model outperforms the single  Poisson background model in most cases, especially for verbose queries where the improvement is statistically significant.
4.3 Term Dependent Smoothing To test the effectiveness of the term dependent  smoothing, we conduct the following two experiments.
With term dependent coefficients, the performance of the Jelinek-Mercer Poisson model is improved in most cases.
method and JM method is statistically significant; an asterisk (*) in Column 5 means that the difference between term dependent two-stage method and query dependent two-stage method is statistically significant; PT stands for per-term.
Their method managed to find
