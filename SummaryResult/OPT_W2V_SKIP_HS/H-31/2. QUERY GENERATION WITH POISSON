The likelihood that a query q is generated from the document language model Λd can be written as p(q|d) = w∈V p(c(w, q)|Λd) (1) This representation is clearly different from the multinomial query generation model as (1) the likelihood includes all the terms in the vocabulary V , instead of only those appearing in q, and (2) instead of the appearance of terms, the event space of this model is the frequencies of each term.
2.2.1 Bayesian Smoothing using Gamma Prior Following the risk minimization framework in [ 11 ] , we assume that a document is generated
