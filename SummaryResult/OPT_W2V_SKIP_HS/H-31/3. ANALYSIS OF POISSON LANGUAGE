We may instead estimate the parameters ∆ = {δ1, ..., δ|V |} by  maximizing the likelihood of the query given the mixture model of p(q|ΛQ) and p(q|U), where ΛQ is the true query model to generate the query and p(q|U) is a query background model as discussed in Section 2.2.3.
This is an advantage over the multinomial mixture models, such as PLSI [8] and LDA [1], for retrieval.
All these mixtures have closed forms, and can be  estimated from the collection of documents efficiently.
Existing work on language model smoothing has already shown that different types of queries should
