In Section 2, we introduce the new family of query generation models with Poisson distribution, and present various smoothing  methods which lead to different retrieval functions.
We find that while with some  smoothing methods, the new model and the multinomial model lead to exactly the same formula, with some other  smoothing methods they diverge, and the Poisson model brings in more flexibility for smoothing.
As in the existing work on multinomial language models, smoothing is critical for this new family of models.
However , multivariate Bernoulli also has one potential advantage over multinomial from the viewpoint of retrieval : in
