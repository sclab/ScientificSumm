A convergence time of 200 iterations indicates non-convergence, in which case we report the efficiency and fairness values at the point we terminate the simulation.
We present the efficiency and fairness at the  equilibrium, compared to two baseline allocation methods:  social optimum and weight-proportional, in which users  distribute their bids proportionally to their weights on the  machines (which may seem a reasonable distribution method intuitively).
As the number of users increases, it becomes almost impossible to satisfy all users independent of the existence of correlation.
If the difference is negligible, then we consider the system to be converged.
