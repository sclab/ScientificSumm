There are two main groups of related work in resource allocation: those that incorporate an economic mechanism, and those that do not.
Examples of this approach are queuing in first-come, first-served (FCFS) order, queueing using the  resource consumption of tasks (e.g., [28]), and scheduling  using combinatorial optimization [19].
uses a reservation abstraction similar to the way airline seats are allocated.
One non-economic approach is scheduling (surveyed by Pinedo [20]).
Their  methodology follows the study of congestion (potential) games [17, 22] by relating the Nash equilibrium to the solution of a (usually convex) global optimization problem.
There have been several analyses
