In this paper we formulate the fixed budget resource allocation game to understand the performance of a distributed  marketbased resource allocation system.
We show analytically and through simulations that despite being highly decentralized, such a system converges quickly to an equilibrium and unlike the social optimum that achieves high efficiency but poor fairness, the proposed allocation scheme achieves a nice  balance of high degrees of efficiency and fairness at the equilibrium.
We look at both the efficiency and the fairness of the  allocation at the equilibrium, where fairness is evaluated through the measures of utility uniformity and envy-freeness.
