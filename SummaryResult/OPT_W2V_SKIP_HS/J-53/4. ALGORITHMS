Let the user"s budget be X and the parallelism bound be k. Our goal is to compute an  allocation of X to up to k machines to maximize the user"s utility.
The remaining question is how to determine k. It is the largest value such that xâˆ— k > 0.
Thus, we obtain the  following algorithm to compute the best response of a user: 1.
Set A to be the k machines with the highest wi/yi.
This strategy aims to adjust the bids so that the marginal values at each machine being bid on are the same
