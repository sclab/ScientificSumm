In addition, with a few exceptions under the finite parallelism model, the system reaches equilibrium quickly by using the best response algorithm and, when the number of users is not too small, by the greedy local  adjustment method.
Another assumption is that users have infinite work, so the more resources they can  acquire, the better.
