The proof in this example can be easily generalized to show that the VCG outcome function can be implemented by a valid  mediator in a self-price position auction, in which there is one position and an arbitrary number of players, n â‰¥ 2.
At example 1 we showed that when there is one position and two players, the VCG outcome function is  implemented by a valid mediator in this auction.
We will show that in this case 285 there is a way to implement the VCG outcome function in a self-price position auction.
There is no mediator that implements the
