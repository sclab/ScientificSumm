In contrast, for every c > 1, if say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates directly and bids less than cv1, then the T-strategy yields a negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1.
A mediator for G is valid, if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a  nonnegative level of utility.
We define a family of mediators mc , c ≥ 1, each of them implements the VCG position auction.
FUNCTION BY MEDIATION In general , except for the VCG position auction we do not expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium.7 Therefore
