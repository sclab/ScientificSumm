While this style of user interface may help a user cope with overlap, the strategy presented in this paper continues to be applicable, by determining the best elements to include in each cluster.
The algorithm presented in this paper controls overlap by  weighting the terms occurring in reported elements to reflect their reduced importance.
For example, when a highly exhaustive and fairly specific (3,2) element contains a much smaller (2,3) element, both should be reported to the user, and retrieval algorithms and evaluation metrics should respect this relationship.
When generating retrieval results over an XML collection , some overlap in
