The Down  routine does not report its argument, but instead recomputes its score and adds it back into S. A node cannot be an argument to Down more than M +1 times, which in turn implies an overall time complexity of O((nM + mh) log n).
One limitation of the re-ranking algorithm is that a single weight α is used to adjust the scores of both the ancestors and descendants of reported elements.
When computing the score of node , the value of x.j selects 1 Up ( x , y ) ≡ 2 if not y.reported then 3
