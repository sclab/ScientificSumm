3.3 Evaluation Metrics The principle evaluation metric used at INEX 2004 is a version of mean average precision (MAP), adjusted by  various quantization functions to give different weights to  different elements, depending on their exhaustivity and specificity values.
Since the work described in this paper is directed at the content-only task, where the IR system receives no guidance regarding the elements to return, the CAS task is ignored in the remainder of our description.
This inex-2003 metric extends the definitions of precision and recall to consider both the size of reported components and the overlap between them.
While XCG was
