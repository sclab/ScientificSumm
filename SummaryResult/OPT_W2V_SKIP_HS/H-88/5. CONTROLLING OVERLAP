In section 8 the algorithm is extended to apply increasing weights, lowering the score, when a term appears in more than one reported element. 
In step 2, the section  containing the paragraph might then have its score s lowered by an amount α · p to reflect the reduced contribution the paragraph should make to the section"s score.
For example, assume a paragraph with score p is reported in step 1.
In equation 1 , xt becomes α0 · yt + α1 · zt , where yt is the number of times t occurs in the title and
