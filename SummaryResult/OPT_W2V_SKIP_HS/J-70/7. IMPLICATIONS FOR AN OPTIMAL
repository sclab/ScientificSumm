Then, if the optimal auction solution allocates item so to the bidder for a type, in the AMD solution, let the mechanism choose outcome o for that type.
It follows that there exists a solution to the optimal auction design instance.
First suppose there exists a solution to the AMD instance, given by an outcome function and a payment function.
To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary  paymentmaximizing deterministic AMD instance, with a single agent and a uniform distribution over types, to the following  optimal combinatorial auction design problem instance with a single bidder with best-only preferences.
The reason is
