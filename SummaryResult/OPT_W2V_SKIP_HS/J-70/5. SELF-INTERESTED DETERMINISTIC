For any clause c satisfied by the given assignment, the value of the objective function in the case where the agent reports type θc will be at most |Θ|.
(This is because we cannot choose the outcome o∗ for such a type, as in this case the agent would have an incentive to report θv instead, where v is the variable satisfying c in the  assignment (so that o(θv) = ol where l occurs in c).)
By the above, for any type θv, the value of the objective function in this mechanism will be |Θ|.
First , suppose there
