Future research includes studying automated mechanism design with a self-interested designer in more restricted  settings such as auctions (where the designer"s objective may include preferences about which bidder should receive the good-as well as payments).
Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so that the agents are motivated to report their  preferences truthfully, and a desirable outcome is chosen.
This has several advantages, 139 but the downside is that the mechanism design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time.
We also want to study the complexity of automated mechanism design in
