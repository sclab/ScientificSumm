Because, again by IR, the maximum payment that can be  extracted for any other type is |Θ| + 1, it follows that the maximum expected payment that could be obtained is at most (|Θ|−1)(|Θ|+1) |Θ| < |Θ| < G, contradicting that this is a solution to the AMD instance.
It follows that the expected payment from our mechanism is at most V |Θ|+s|Θ|+(|C|−s)(|Θ|+1) Θ , where s is the number of satisfied clauses.
( For if we extracted more from this type , the agent '' s utility in this case would be less than 1 ; and if v is
