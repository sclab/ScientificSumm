× ΘN → R.2 There are two types of constraint on the designer in  building the mechanism.
In an automated mechanism design  setting, we are given: • a finite set of outcomes O; • a finite set of N agents; • for each agent i, 1. a finite set of types Θi, 2. a probability distribution γi over Θi (in the case of correlated types, there is a single joint distribution γ over Θ1 × .
In any automated mechanism design setting with an IR constraint , there is a fallback outcome o0 ∈ O where , for any agent i
