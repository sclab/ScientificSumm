Further work concerns first coupling induction and abduction in order to perform collaborative concept learning when  examples are only partially observed by each agent, and second, investigating partial memory learning: how learning is  preserved whenever one agent or the whole MAS forgets some selected examples.
The main feature of this  collaborative learning mechanism is that it maintains a  consistency property: though during the learning process each agent only receives and stores, with some limited  redundancy, part of the examples received by the MAS, at any moment the current hypothesis is consistent with the whole set of examples.
