We extend this notion of consistency (or soundness) to the whole MAS and  discuss how to obtain that, at any moment, a same consistent concept representation is present in each agent.
Surprisingly some difficult boolean formulas are  better learned, given the same learning set, by a Multi agent system than by a single agent.
The resulting method SMILE (standing for Sound  Multiagent Incremental LEarning) is described and experimented here.
This article deals with the problem of collaborative  learning in a multi-agent system.
The  corresponding protocol is applied to supervised concept learning.
Here each agent can update incrementally its beliefs B
