Pastry"s expected  number of routing steps is logn, where n is the number of nodes, but as Figure 3 illustrates, this algorithm does not guarantee path  convergence: if two nodes in a domain have nodeIds that match a key in the same number of bits, both of them can route to a third node outside the domain when routing for that key.
Second , splitting values associated with different names into different aggregation values allows our system to leverage Distributed Hash Tables ( DHTs ) to map different names to different trees and thereby spread the function ''
