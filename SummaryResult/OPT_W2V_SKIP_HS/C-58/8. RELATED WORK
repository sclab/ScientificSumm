Many systems-building upon both Plaxton"s bit-correcting strategy [32, 46] and upon other strategies [24, 29, 35]-have chosen to hide this power and export a simple and  general distributed hash table abstraction as a useful building block for a broad range of distributed applications.
Some of these systems internally make use of the reduction forest not only for routing but also for caching [32], but for simplicity, these systems do not  generally export this powerful functionality in their external interface.
Ganglia [ 15 , 23 ] uses a hierarchical system where the attributes are replicated within clusters using
