In our implementation we choose to return results at all levels k < l for a level-l probe because (i) it is inexpensive as the nodes traversed for level-l probe also contain level k aggregates for k < l and as we expect the network cost of transmitting the  additional information to be small for the small aggregates which we focus and (ii) it is useful as applications can efficiently get several aggregates with a single probe (e.g., for domain-scoped queries as explained in Section 4.2).
In the other extreme case of the aggressive Update-All immediate computation and propagation on writes [
