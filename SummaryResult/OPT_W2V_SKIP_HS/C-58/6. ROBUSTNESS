Probes for the file location can then be answered without accessing the root; hence they are not affected by the failure of the root.
Our two main principles for robustness are to guarantee (i) read availability - probes complete in finite time, and (ii) eventual consistency -  updates by a live node will be visible to probes by connected nodes in finite time.
In our system, however, all internal nodes have to be replicated along with the root.
