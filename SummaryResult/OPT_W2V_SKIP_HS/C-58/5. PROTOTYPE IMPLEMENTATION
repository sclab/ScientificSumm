Update When a level i virtual node receives an update for an attribute from a child below: it first recomputes the level-i  aggregate value for the specified key, stores that value in its reduction MIB and then, subject to the function"s up and domain parameters, passes the updated value to the appropriate parent based on the  attribute key.
As Figure 1 illustrates, the system satisfies a probe for a level-i aggregate value using a four-phase protocol that may be short-circuited when  updates have previously propagated either results or partial results up or down the tree.
Each aggregate function
