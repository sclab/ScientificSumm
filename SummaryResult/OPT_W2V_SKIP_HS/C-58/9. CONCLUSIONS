This paper presents a Scalable Distributed Information  Management System (SDIMS) that aggregates information in large-scale networked systems and that can serve as a basic building block for a broad range of applications.
For large scale systems,  hierarchical aggregation is a fundamental abstraction for scalability.
We build our system by extending ideas from Astrolabe and DHTs to achieve ( i ) scalability with respect to both nodes and attributes through a new aggregation abstraction that helps leverage DHT '' s internal trees for aggregation , ( ii ) flexibility through a simple API that lets applications control propagation of reads and
