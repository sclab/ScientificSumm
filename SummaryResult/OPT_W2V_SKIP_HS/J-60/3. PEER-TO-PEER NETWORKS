245 The network mechanism utilizes the chain mechanism in the following way: When agent B requests a file from agent A (at most r − 1 far), then A sends to B the list of his neighbors and the output of the ping protocol to all of these neighbors.
If B has the certificate(A1, f), then he can apply directly to A1 and request the file (if he refuses, then B can go to court).
The chain mechanism follows: • Stage i: Agent B forwards a request for the file f to Ai (through {Ak}k≤i).
If Ai reports
