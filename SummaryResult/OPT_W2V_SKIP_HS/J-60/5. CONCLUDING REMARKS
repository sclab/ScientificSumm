However, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs.
The challenge is to find more realistic scenarios in which the partial informational  assumption is applicable.
In this paper we have seen a new partial informational assumption, and we have demonstrated its suitability to networks in which computational agents can easily collect and distribute information.
Incentives for  information propagation should be considered as well (e.g., for P2P networks for file sharing).
Some issues for future work include
