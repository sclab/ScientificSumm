1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.
We demonstrate this concept through some motivating examples that (i) seem natural in distributed settings and (ii) cannot be implemented in dominant  strategies even if there is an authorized center with a direct  connection to every agent or even if players have single-parameter domains.
Third, the constructed mechanisms are often  decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their  subgame perfect strategies.
And so it
