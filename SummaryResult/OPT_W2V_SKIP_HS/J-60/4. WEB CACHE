We assume that the only way agent i can affect the true qi(t) is by superficially increasing his demand for the cached item, but not the other way (that is, agent"s loss, incurred by giving up a necessary request for the item, is not negligible).
Negligible costs: we assume p-informed agents, where p is such that the agent"s induced cost for keeping records of information is negligible.
The network is homogeneous in the sense that if agent j happens to handle k requests initiated by agent i during the time slot t , then qi
