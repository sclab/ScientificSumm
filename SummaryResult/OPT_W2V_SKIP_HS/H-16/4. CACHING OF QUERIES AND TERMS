The distance in the plot is measured in the number of distinct queries  separating a query and its repetition, and it considers only queries appearing at least 10 times.
First, it captures the amount of locality of queries and terms in a sequence of queries.
From Figures 6 and 7, we  conclude that even if we set the size of the query answers cache to a relatively large number of entries, the miss rate is high.
We show in Section 5 that caching a small fraction of terms , while accounting for terms appearing in many documents , is potentially
