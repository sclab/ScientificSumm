We provide a framework for the analysis of the trade-off between static caching of query answers and posting lists; â€¢ Static caching of terms can be more effective than  dynamic caching with, for example, LRU.
As posting lists have variable size, caching them dynamically is not very efficient, due to the complexity in terms of  efficiency and space, and the skewed distribution of the query stream, as shown later.
In such a setting, to achieve a fast response time and to increase the query throughput, using a cache is crucial.
Caching terms : As the engine evaluates a particular query
