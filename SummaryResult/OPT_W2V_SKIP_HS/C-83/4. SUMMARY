With the approach presented in this paper and the implemented prototype, we offer real-time collaborative editing and management of documents stored in a special way in a database.
Pervasive document editing and management is enabled due to the proposed architecture with the embedded  real46 time server component, which propagates changes to a document immediately and consequently offers up-to-date documents.
With this approach we provide security, consistency and availability of documents and consequently offer pervasive document editing and management.
Document editing and managing is consequently enabled anywhere, anytime and with any device.
The above-descried system is implemented in a running prototype
