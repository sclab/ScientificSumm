Such a central component is not available in an infrastructure envisaged in our system architecture and the developed middleware TAO (The Ace Orb) is quite complex and unsuitable to be directly integrated in smart devices.
There are efforts to implement CORBA for control  networks, tailored to connect sensor and actuator components [15, 19].
Islands of tight control may be realized by a control network and cooperate via wired or wireless networks covering a large number of these subnetworks.
In [10] a real-time event system for CORBA has been introduced.
