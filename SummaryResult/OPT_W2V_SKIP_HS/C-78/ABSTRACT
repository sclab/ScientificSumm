The paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on events-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the  system.
The challenging characteristics of these applications include sentience and autonomy of components, issues of  responsiveness and safety criticality, geographical dispersion, mobility and evolution.
the interactions through the environment.
Looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical  components, hardware and software and a network interface, thus these components have different characteristics compared to pure software components.
This is complemented by the
