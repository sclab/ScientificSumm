The event attributes which describe aspects of the context and temporal constraints for the  dissemination will be exploited for this purpose.
One direction of future research will be the inclusion of real-world communication channels established between sensors and actuators in the temporal analysis and the  ordering of such events in a cause-effect chain.
We cannot assume that the network architecture in such a system is homogeneous.
To reduce network traffic and only disseminate those events to the subscribers which they are really interested in and which have a chance to arrive timely , the encapsulation and scoping schemes have
