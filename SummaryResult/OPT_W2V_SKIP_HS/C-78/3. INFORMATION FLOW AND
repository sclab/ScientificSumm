As mentioned above, a  fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and  interact with it.
A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the  existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.
Interaction with the  environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as  discussed in Section 4.2.
In systems that involve interactions with the
