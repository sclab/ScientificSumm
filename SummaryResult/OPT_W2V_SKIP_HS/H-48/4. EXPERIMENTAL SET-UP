In our evaluation, we used both the title and the description fields of topics  151200 as queries, so we have two sets of results for the AP89 Collection.
The FSupp Collection is a proprietary collection of 11,953 case law documents for which we have 44 queries (ranging from four to twenty-two words after stop word removal) with full relevance judgments.3 The average length of documents in the FSupp Collection is 3444 words.
As a result , we expect that when query terms are removed from relevant documents , the performance of these systems should degrade more dramatically than their counterparts
