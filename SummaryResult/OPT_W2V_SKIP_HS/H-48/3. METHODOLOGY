In  contrast, the controlled variable in this framework is the query term that has been removed from the documents relevant to that query, as determined by the removal strategy, S. Query terms are removed one by one, in a manner and order  determined by S, so that collections differ only with respect to the one term that has been removed (or masked) in the documents relevant to that query.
Based on the purpose of the evaluation and the retrieval algorithm being used , it might make more sense to choose a removal order for S based on query term IDF
