Although not attempted in our experiments, another  application of this evaluation framework would be to remove query terms individually, rather than incrementally, to  analyze which terms (or possibly which types of terms) are being helped most by a QE technique on a particular test collection.
In addition to looking at average performance of IR  systems, the results of individual queries could be examined and compared more closely, perhaps giving more insight into the classification and prediction of difficult queries, or perhaps showing which QE techniques improve (or degrade)  individual query performance under differing degrees of  querydocument term mismatch.
In other
