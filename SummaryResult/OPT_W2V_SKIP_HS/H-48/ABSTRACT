While this measures an overall change in performance, it does not directly measure the  effectiveness of IR systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term mismatch between the query and relevant documents, nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query-document term mismatch.
The effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) systems is  influenced by the degree of term overlap between user queries and relevant documents.
The proposed approach is attractive because it provides an estimate of system performance under varying degrees of query-document term mismatch , it makes use of readily available test
