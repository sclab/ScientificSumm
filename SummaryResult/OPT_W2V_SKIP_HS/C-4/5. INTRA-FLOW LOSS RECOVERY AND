The results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that, while the loss of some of the +l packets has some  measurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be considered to be very low. 
For comparison we again use a scheme where  packets are alternatingly marked as being either 0 or +l (ALT-MARK).
This also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a minor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained.
also allow a reasonable evaluation of how losses in the fl class affect the performance of the SPB-algorithms.
Thus , considering voice with temporal loss sensitivity
