Rosenberg has done a similar experiment ([9]), showing that the difference between the original and the concealed signal with increasing loss burstiness in terms of a mean-squared error is significant, however.
On the other hand it shows , that a large number of different Figure 5 : Utility curve for PCM without loss conc e a l m e n t ( EMBSD ) Figure 6 : Utility curve for PCM with loss concealment ( EMBSD ) Figure 7 : Variability of the perceptual distortion with 10s~ concealment ( EMBSD ) 445 Figure 8 : Utility curve for the G.729
