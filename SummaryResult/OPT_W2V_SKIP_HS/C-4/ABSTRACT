We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss.
For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G.729) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.
Best effort packet-switched networks, like the Internet, do not offer a reliable transmission of packets to applications with real-time constraints such as voice.
For voice this utility impairment is twofold : on one hand , even short bursts of
