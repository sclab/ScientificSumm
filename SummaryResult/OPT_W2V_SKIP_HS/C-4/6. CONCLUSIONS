While we have tested other codecs only  informally, we think that our results reflect the fundamental  difference between codecs which either encode the speech  waveâ€˜We also used the G.729 encoder for the redundant source coding.
In this paper we have characterized the behaviour of a  samplebased codec (PCM) and a frame-based codec (G.729) in the presence of packet loss.
Such schemes can  better accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are difficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity of both the codec and the redundancy generator.
We have then developed intraflow loss recovery and control mechanisms to increase the
