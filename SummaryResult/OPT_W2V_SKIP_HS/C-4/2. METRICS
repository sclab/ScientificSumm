The run-length model implies a geometric distribution for residing in state X = m. For the probability of a burst loss length of k packets we thus can compute estimates for  performance parameters in a higher order model representation (note that here Y represent the random variable used in the higher-order models).
(1) Additionally, we also define a random variable Y which de scribes the distribution of burst loss lengths with respect to the bunt loss events j (and not to packet events like in the definition of X).
It is interesting to note that for all states with Z (
