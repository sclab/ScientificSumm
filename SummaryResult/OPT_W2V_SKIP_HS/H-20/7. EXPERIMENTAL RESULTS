System-5 outperforms all other systems including system-6, and it performs only 2.78e+8 comparing times in detection procedure which is only 13.4% of system-1.
The best system (system-5) has a minimum normalized cost 0.5012, which is 0.0797 better than system-1, and also better than any other results previously reported for this dataset [8, 13].
System-2: this system is the same as system-1 except that S-C detection procedure is used.
System-4: implemented based on the approach presented in section 5.1, i.e., terms are reweighted according to the distance between term distributions in a cluster and all stories.
