This has a similar effect: the correlation of mean logitAP and average logitAP with hubness are now small positive numbers (0.23 and 0.15 respectively), still comfortably away from the high correlations with regular MAP and AAP, i.e., not presenting the problematic phenomenon (ii) above (over-dependency on easy topics).
We now turn to discuss if these indicators are meaningful and useful in practice, and how they correlate with standard measures used in TREC.
Tables 3a and 3b show the Pearson '' s correlation values between Inlinks , PageRank , Hub , Authority and , respectively , MAP or AAP ( Outlinks
