We then apply  analysis methods originally developed for search applications to the resulting network.
These indicators and algorithms might be quite  general in nature, and can be used for applications which are very different from search result ranking.
Some indicators (and the corresponding algorithms that compute them) have been found useful in this respect, and are nowadays well known: Inlinks (the number of links to a Web page), PageRank [7], and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) [5].
Several extensions to these algorithms have been and are being  proposed.
