Each AP(si, tj) value in the table depends on both system  goodness and topic ease (the value will increase if a system is good and/or the topic is easy).
Arcs and weights in the graph can be interpreted as follows: • (weight on) arc s → t: how much the system s thinks that the topic t is easy - assuming that a system has no knowledge of the other systems (or in other words, how easy we might think the topic is, knowing only the results for this one system).
The second normalization removes the influence of the single
