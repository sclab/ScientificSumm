This protocol is such that, when no two tasks have exactly the same  efficiency, in every iteration at least one task is removed from a task list.1 From this the computation and communication property of the algorithm follows.
If the maximum flow in each network is equal to the total required resources of that type, the current combination of tasks is feasible.
If the maximum flow is equal to the sum of all  resources required by the subset of tasks, we know that a  feasible solution exists (see Algorithm 2).
A bid consists of all the resources the agent is
