In this paper we studied the task allocation problem in a social network (STAP), which can be seen as a new, more general, variant of the TAP.
Finally, it would be interesting to study real-life instances of the social task allocation problem, and see how they  relate to the randomly generated networks of different types studied in this paper.
There are many interesting extensions to our current work.
Finally , we used the optimal solution and the upper-bound ( for larger instances ) to conduct an extensive set of experiments to assess the solution quality and the computational efficiency of
