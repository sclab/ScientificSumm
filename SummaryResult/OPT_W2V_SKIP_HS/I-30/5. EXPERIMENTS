5.2.2 Experiment 2 To study the robustness of the GDAP against different problem settings, we generate instances where the task  benefit distribution is different: 40% of the tasks gets a 10 times higher benefit (as described in Setting 2).
An exception is, similar to what we have seen in Figure 2, that the solution of the GDAP is also very good if the connections are extremely limited (degree 2), due to the fact that the number of possibly allocated tasks is very small.
For the next experiment we fix the resource ratio to 1.0 and study the quality of both
