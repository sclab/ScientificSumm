Given a set of agents A connected by a social network SN = (A, AE), and a finite set of tasks T , the social task allocation problem (or STAP for short) is the problem of finding the efficient task allocation φ, such that φ is valid and the social welfare Uφ is maximized. 
, am} in a social network SN, a task allocation is a mapping φ : T × A × R → N. A valid task allocation in SN must satisfy the following constrains: • A task allocation must be correct.
Each task t ∈ T can only be allocated to
