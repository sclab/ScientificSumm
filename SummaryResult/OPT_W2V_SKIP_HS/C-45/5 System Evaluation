It is interesting to notice in Figure 25 the improvement in the localization time obtained by simply combining the color and the connectivity constrained techniques.
The parameters that we vary in simulations (subsequent to image acquisition and  connectivity collection) the number of colors, the number of  anchors, the number of false positives or negatives as input to the Node ID Matching component, the distance between the imaging device and sensor network (i.e., range),  atmospheric conditions (light attenuation coefficient) and CCR reflectance (indicative of its quality).
We assume that 50 unique color filters can be manufactured , that the sensor network
