A very recent, remarkable, localization technique is based on radio interferometry, RIPS [13], which utilizes two transmitters to create an interfering signal.
Ranging  techniques dependent on hardware are the time-of-flight (ToF) and the time-difference-of-arrival(TDoA).
In a similar manner, the Lighthouse system [22] uses a parallel light beam, that is emitted by an anchor which rotates with a certain period.
From the  spatiotemporal knowledge for the created events and the temporal information provided by sensor nodes, nodes" spatial  information can be obtained.
More recently, several localization schemes that exploit the sensing capabilities of sensor nodes, have been proposed.
