An abductive program is a pair P, H where P is an EDP and H is a set of literals called abducibles.
Given an NAF-free EDP P, Cn(P) denotes the smallest set of ground literals which is (i) closed under P, i.e., for  every ground rule r in Ground(P), body(r) ⊆ Cn(P) implies head(r) ∩ Cn(P) = ∅; and (ii) logically closed, i.e., it is  either consistent or equal to Lit.
A program P with variables is a shorthand of its ground instantiation Ground ( P ) , the set of ground rules obtained from
