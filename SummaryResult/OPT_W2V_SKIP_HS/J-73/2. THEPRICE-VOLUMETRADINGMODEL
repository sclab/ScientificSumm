In contrast to the VWAP, another common measure of the performance of an online selling algorithm would be its one-way trading (OWT) competitive ratio [3] with respect to a set of sequences Σ: ROWT(A) = max S∈Σ max 1≤t≤T {pt/VWAPA(S)} where the algorithms performance is compared to the largest individual price appearing in the sequence S. In both VWAP and OWT, we are comparing the average price per share received by a selling algorithm to some  measure of market performance.
It states that if we are willing to let the number of shares sold vary with Q , we
