On the other hand, if Pvol is exponential, then Pbins vol is uniform, leading to an O(log(Q)) competitive ratio, just as in the more adversarial price-volume setting discussed earlier.
Here Pmaxprice is a distribution over just the maximum price of the day, and we then examine worst-case sequences  consistent with this price (seq(p) ⊂ Σ is the set of all market sequences satisfying max1≤t≤T pt = p).
We emphasize that in these models, only the distribution of maximum volume and price is known to the algorithm.
It is thus natural that the macroscopic distribution model performance of such
