For any such P, one can construct a set system S and a vector of costs c such that NTUmin(c) is the optimal solution to P. PROOF.
Condition (3) for yi implies bx + byi = czi = 1, so byi = 1 and NTUmin(c) = n. For path auctions, it has been shown [18] that NTUmin(c) is non-monotone in a slightly different sense, i.e., with respect to adding a new edge (agent) rather than a new feasible set (a team of existing agents).
In particular , for the instance in Proposition 5 , the VCG payment is smaller than TUmax (
