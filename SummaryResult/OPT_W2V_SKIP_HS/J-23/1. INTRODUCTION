While our main result about vertex cover auctions (Theorem 4) is with respect to NTUmin = Î½, we make use of the new definitions by first comparing the payment of our mechanism to a weaker bound NTUmax, and then  bootstrapping from this result to obtain the desired bound.
Both of these papers are based on the definition of frugality ratio used in [1]; as mentioned before, this means that their results only apply to bipartite graphs.
This paper studies an auction that is based on the greedy allocation algorithm , which has an approximation ratio of log n. While the main
