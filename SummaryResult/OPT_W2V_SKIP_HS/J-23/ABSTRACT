We study the relationships between the different payment bounds, both for  general set systems and for specific set-system auctions, such as path auctions and vertex-cover auctions.
Moreover, we show how to transform any  truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation ratio.
We show that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible worst-case bound; this is the first auction for this problem to have these properties.
The ratio captures the extent to which the mechanism overpays , relative to perceived fair cost
