The resulting change in payments can be seen as the price of co-operation and corresponds to replacing condition (1) with the following weaker condition (1∗ ): be ≥ 0 for all e ∈ E. (1∗ ) By considering all possible combinations of these modifications, we obtain four different payment bounds, namely • TUmin(c, S), which is the solution to the optimisation  problem Minimise B subject to (1∗ ), (2), and (3).
On the other hand , in a game in which the centre proposes payments to the agents in S and the agents accept them as long as ( 1 ) ,
