One of the main reasons for the interest in combinatorial auctions and exchanges is that it allows for expressive bidding.
In order to achieve the full economic  efficiency allowed by the market"s expressiveness (or even come close to it), hard computational problems must be solved in combinatorial auctions and exchanges, as well as in the charity donation market (as we will see).
(This is known as the clearing problem.)
Combinatorial auctions and exchanges have recently become a popular research topic [20, 21, 17, 22, 9, 18, 13, 3, 12, 26, 19, 25, 2].
A bidder can express exactly
