We  formulated the corresponding clearing problem (deciding how much each bidder pays, and how much each charity receives), and showed that it is NP-complete to approximate to any  ratio even in very restricted settings.
It is also 59 important to identify other classes of bids (besides concave ones) for which the clearing problem is tractable.
We also showed that even though the clearing problem  decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.
We showed that an ex-post efficient mechanism is impossible even with only one charity and a
