Using the fact that the function is concave, for each value of πci , the tightest upper bound on ui j is the one corresponding to the segment above that value of πci , and therefore these constraints are sufficient to force the correct value of ui j.
Representing this function is entirely analogous to how we  represented ui j as a function of πci .
Each ui j is given as a function of πci by the (piecewise linear) function provided by the bidder.
Now , let xi , j l be an indicator variable that should be 1 if πci is
