(The solution is nonzero by assumption; if only some bk are accepted, the total payment from these bids is at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| < 1, which is not enough for any bid to be accepted; and if one of the bl is accepted, then the threshold for the corresponding bv is also reached.)
All that is left to show is that this partial assignment satisfies at least T clauses.
Again, the other bv and bl cannot (by themselves) help to close this gap; and the bk can contribute at most |K| 1 8|V ||K| < 1 4|V | .
Then ,
