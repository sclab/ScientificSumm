This allows us to extract the maximum payment from the bids bxi -a total payment of 2vH − c. Additionally , the utility of bidder bj is now i : r j i > 0 rj i ( H − x∗ i ) + i : r j i < 0 −rj i ( H + x∗ i ) = ( i |rj i | ) H − i rj i x∗ i ≥ ( i |rj i | ) H − sj ( where the last inequality stems from the fact that constraint j must be satisfied in the
