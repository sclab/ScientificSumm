Although agent interaction plays a vital role in MAS, and  messagecentric approaches to agent interaction have their drawbacks, present agent-oriented programming languages do not provide support for implementing agent interaction that is flexible and robust.
This framework supports  modelling interactions at a higher level (using social commitments),  resulting in more flexible interactions.
In this  paper we consider one approach for modelling agent interactions: the commitment machines framework.
The contributions of this paper are : a mapping from a commitment machine to a collection of BDI-style plans ; extensions to the semantics of BDI programming languages ; and an examination of
