We have presented a scheme for mapping commitment machines to BDI platforms (using SAAPL as an exemplar), identified three changes that needed to be made to SAAPL to support CM-based  interaction, and shown that turn management can be avoided in  CMbased interaction, provided the CM is locally monotonic.
Although we have implemented the NetBill interaction using 3APL, the changes to the semantics were done by modifying our NetBill 3APL program, rather than by modifying the 3APL  implementation itself.
There has already been some work on comparing Hermes with a conventional message-centric approach to designing interaction , and this has shown
