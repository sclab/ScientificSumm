This argument can be extended to show that once agents start taking different paths through the FSM all actions taken until the point where they converge on a single state must be monotonic, and hence it is always possible to converge (because actions aren"t disabled), so the interaction is error free; and the resulting state once convergence occurs is the same (because monotonic actions commute).
Proof: Once all messages have been processed we have that all agents will have performed the same action set, perhaps in a  different order.
This means that even if agents take different paths
