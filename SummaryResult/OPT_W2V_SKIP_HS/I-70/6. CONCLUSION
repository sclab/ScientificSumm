From the point of view of ontology building, this work is a first step showing the relevance of our approach.
The current state of our software allows to produce simple structures, to propose them to the ontologist and to make them evolve depending on the  modifications he made.
Performances of the system are interesting and some aspects are even comparable to their centralized counterpart.
In other words this algorithm introduces  inThe Sixth Intl.
After being presented as a promising solution, ensuring model quality and their terminological richness, ontology building from textual corpus analysis is difficult and costly.
Our system makes
