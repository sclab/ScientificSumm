Although the head coverage rule is an improvement because it is based on how the ontologists generally work, it only addresses low level structuring but not the intermediate levels of the tree.
When the  system works by itself on a fixed data set given during initialization, the final result is equivalent to what we could obtain with a  centralized algorithm.
By using test data and letting the system work by itself, we obtain the hierarchy of figure 11 after stabilization.
