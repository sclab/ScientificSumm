That is why a system like ASIUM [6] tries to soften the problem with a system-user collaboration by showing to the ontologist the created classes after each step of reasoning.
It can be explained by the low probability that a data set forces the system to create only minimal groups (two items) or maximal (n − 1 elements) for each step of reasoning.
Because of this, the similarity computations are done twice for each agent pair.
It is bootstrapped in the following way : • a TOP agent having no parent is created , it will be the root of
