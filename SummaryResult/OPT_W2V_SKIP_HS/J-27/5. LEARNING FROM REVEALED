To avoid this problem we reprove the theorem by constructing utility functions u such that u(xi) = u(xi ) for all i and therefore a distinct utility function is associated with each labeling.
✷ Proof 2: The utility functions satisfying Afriat"s condition in the first proof could be trivial assigning the same utility to xi as to xi .
Let C be a set of demand functions from Rd + to Rd + then fatC(γ) = ∞ Proof 1: For ε > 0 let pi = 2−i p for i = 1, .
, ( ynd , pnd ) is consistent with monotone concave utility
