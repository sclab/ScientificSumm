Proof : If L(A) is feasible then it is easy to see that u(x) = min i {yi + sipi(x − xi)} is a concave utility function that is consistent with the  observations, and from our previous remark it follows that D(A) satisfies AC.
If φ is constant on C then aij ij+1 = 0 for j = 1, .
D(A) has no negative cycles, hence G is acyclic and breadth first search can assign potentials φi such that φj ≤ φi + wij for (i, j) ∈ S ∪ E. We relabel the vertices so that φ1 ≥ φ2 ≥ .
Let
