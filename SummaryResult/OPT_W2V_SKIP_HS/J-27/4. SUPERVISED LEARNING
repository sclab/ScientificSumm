The minimal mL is called the sample complexity of C. Note that in the definition there is no mention of the time complexity to find h in H and evaluating h(p).
W.l.g we may assume the error is bounded (since we are looking at what is essentially a finite set) therefore the probability that erσ(h, fb0 ) > ε cannot be too small, hence fb0 is not  PAClearnable with a sample of size n ✷ The following theorem gives an upper bound on the  sample complexity required for learning a set of functions with finite fat shattering dimension.
