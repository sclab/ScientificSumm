This approach is useful when there is reason to make these stipulations, it gives an explicit utility function which can be used to make precise forecasts on demand for  unob36 served prices.
However, these methods do not consider the complexity of the demand functions and do not use any probabilistic model of the observations.
It is often the case that apart form the demand  observations there is additional information on the system and it is sensible to make parametric assumptions, namely, to stipulate some functional form of utility.
Given observations of price and demand , under what circumstances can we
