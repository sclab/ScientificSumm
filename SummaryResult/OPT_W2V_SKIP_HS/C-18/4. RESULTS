In this set of  experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of  magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm.
We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3.
Address Scanning : • Random : = addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space , namely , a 224 address space ; and • Local Bias : = addresses are selected at random from either a local subnet
