Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were  selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.
In the case of a simple local area network of 30  computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected.
The simple swarm worm described in section
