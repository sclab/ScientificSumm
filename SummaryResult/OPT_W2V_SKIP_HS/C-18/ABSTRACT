However, such strategies are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.
In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of Swarm Worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a swarm worm.
We will show that ZachiK is capable of propagating at a rate 2 orders of  magnitude faster than similar worms without swarm capabilities.
Specifically, we  propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence.
Although the main action
