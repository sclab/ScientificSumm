2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions  independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate  neighbors.
The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to,  distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.
In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general , it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it
