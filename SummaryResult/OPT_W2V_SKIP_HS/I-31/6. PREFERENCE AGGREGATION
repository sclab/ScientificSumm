We can then interpret our formulae in an SWF F over K, a preference profile L ∈ L(K) and a pair (a, b) ⊆ K × K, a b, as follows: F, L, (a, b) |=swf φ ⇔ fF , γL , aPb |=LK φ where γL is the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile L. While in the general judgment aggregation case a formula is  interpreted in the context of an agenda item, in the preference  aggregation case a formula is thus interpreted in the context of a pair of alternatives.
