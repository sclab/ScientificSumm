We argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about  judgment aggregation.
The axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical Arrovian  preference aggregation.
Thus our framework sheds light on the  differences between the logical principles behind general judgment aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation on the other.
In future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness and consistency requirements of judgment sets , and try to characterise
