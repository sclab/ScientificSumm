In a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=L σ and f, γ, q |=L ¬σ.
, An) ⇔ |{i : p ∈ Ai}| > |{i : p Ai}| f |= MV exactly iff f has the above property for all judgment  profiles and propositions.
4.1 The Discursive Paradox As illustrated in Example 1, the following formula expresses proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p MV = σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i (4) i.e., the following property of a JAR f and admissible profile A1, .
Since f(γ) is complete, ¬q ∈ f(γ).
and there exists an
