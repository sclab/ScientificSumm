However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper.
Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.
Formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated preferences for a given representation [6, 7, 8].
This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying
