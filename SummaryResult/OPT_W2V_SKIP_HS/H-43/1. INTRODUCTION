Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.
In the following discussion, we use the task of web page  classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.
From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.
Instead,  similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data.
The
