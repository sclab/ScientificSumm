For adjusted  noenvy, if (σ, t) is an allocation for some q ∈ Q, let tij be the 237 transfer of job i when the transfer of i is calculated with respect to ordering σij .
As before denote σij be an ordering where the position of i and j is swapped from an ordering σ.
This gives us the Shapley value rule by Lemma 3.
An allocation rule satisfies no-envy if for all q ∈ Q , ( σ , t ) ∈ ψ ( q ) , and i , j ∈ N , we have πi ≤ ci
