This gives us the Shapley values of jobs i through n. Setting i = 1, we get cost shares of all the jobs from ψ as the Shapley value.
Using this argument for every i ∈ N and using the expression for the Shapley value in Lemma 3, we get the Shapley value rule.
An implication of Pareto indifference axiom and Lemma 2 is that for every efficient ordering there is some set of transfers of jobs such that it is part of an efficient rule and the cost share of a job in all these allocations are same.
Consider any
