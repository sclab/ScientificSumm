σ : N → N is an ordering of jobs in N and σi denotes the position of job i in the ordering σ.
An allocation for q = (N, p, θ) ∈ Q has two components: an ordering σ and a transfer ti for every job i ∈ N. ti denotes the payment received by job i.
The costs to jobs in S \ {i, j} is not changed from σ∗ to σ.
This means, we can find two  consecutive jobs i, j ∈ S (σ∗ i = σ∗ j + 1) such that γi > γj.
For any S ⊆ N , let σ∗
