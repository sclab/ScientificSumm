232 research is how to share the savings in costs from the  initial ordering to the optimal ordering amongst jobs (also see Hamers et al.
For another queueing model, Mitra [18] shows that first best implementation is possible if and only if the cost function satisfies a combinatorial property and an independence  property.
One of their approaches, called the tail game, is related to the reverse rule of Chun [1].
A key axiom that we introduce gives us a bound on cost share of a job in a group of jobs which have the same ratio of unit time waiting
