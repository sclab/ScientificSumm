Their adaptive middleware uses utility functions to choose the best context provider (given the QoC requirements of  applications and the QoC of alternative means of context  acquisition).
Henricksen and Indulska propose an approach to modelling and using  imperfect information in [3].
Judd and Steenkiste in [5] describe a generic interface to query context services  allowing clients to specify their quality requirements as bounds on accuracy, confidence, update time and sample interval.
Our approach can reduce the burden of the middleware, because we do not need the  middleware to provide a context selection mechanism.
Also , it can guarantee context providers
