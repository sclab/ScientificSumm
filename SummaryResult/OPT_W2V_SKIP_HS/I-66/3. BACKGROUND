, ωn ∈ Ω is the observation received in state s. This implies that each agent"s observation depends only on the  unaffectable state, its local action and on its resulting local state.
Si refers to the set of local states of agent i and Su is the set of unaffectable states.
, alr ), where each l could refer to any sub-group of agents and r = |l|.
Ω = ×1≤i≤nΩi is the set of joint observations where Ωi is the set of observations for agents i. Observational independence is assumed in ND-POMDPs i.e. , the joint observation function is defined as
