The expected value for this joint policy is used to prune out the nodes in level 2 (the ones with upper bounds < 234) When creating policies for each non-leaf agent i, SPIDER  potentially performs two steps: 1.
Level 2 of the search tree indicates that the joint policies are sorted based on upper bounds computed for root agent"s policies.
For NBA, the heuristic computation is similar to that of a normal policy, except in cases where there is no action associated with policy nodes.
The key idea in SPIDER is to avoid computation of expected values for the
