This algorithm is based on the combination of a classical heuristic search algorithm, Aâˆ— and decentralized control theory.
The key differences between SPIDER and MAA* are: (a) Enhancements to SPIDER (VAX and PAX) provide for quality guaranteed approximations, while MAA* is a global optimal algorithm and hence involves significant  computational complexity; (b) Due to MAA*"s inability to exploit  interaction structure, it was illustrated only with two agents.
This paper presents four algorithms SPIDER , SPIDER-ABS , PAX and VAX that provide a novel combination of features for policy search in distributed POMDPs : ( i ) exploiting agent
