The rating, y, for a  document, x, is conditioned on the document and the user model, wm, associated with the user m. Users share information about their models through the prior, Φ = (µ, Σ).
The joint  likelihood for all the variables in the probabilistic model, which includes the data and the parameters, is: P(D, θ) = P(Φ) m P(wm|Φ) j P(ym,j|xm,j, wm) (1) For simplicity, we assume a, b, c, and σ are provided to the system. 
REGRESSION Assume there are M users in the system.
