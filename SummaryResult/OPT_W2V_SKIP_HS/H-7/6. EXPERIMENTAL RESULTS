Figure 2 and Figure 3 show that the proposed new  algorithm works better than the standard EM algorithm on the Netflix and MovieLens data sets.
The results suggest that only on a corpus where the number of unrelated user-feature pairs is much larger than the number of related pairs, such as on the  Netflix data set, the proposed technique will get a significant improvement over standard EM.
Figure 4 shows that the two algorithms work similarly on the Reuters-E data set.
