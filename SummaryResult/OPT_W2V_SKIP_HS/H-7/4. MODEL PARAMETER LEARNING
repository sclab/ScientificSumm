Thus the corresponding weight of the director in the prior µk at the first M step would be very low , and the variance σm,k will be large (Equations 8 and 7).
To estimate ¯wm, we only need to calculate the  numerical solutions for dimensions that are related to user m. To estimate σ2 k and µk, we only sum over users that are related to the kth feature.
Applying EM to the above problem , the set of user models w are the unobservable hidden variables and we have : Q = w P ( w|µ , Σ2 ,
