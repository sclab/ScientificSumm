It is worth mentioning that even if the original problem space is not sparse, sparseness can be created artificially when a recommendation system uses user-specific feature selection techniques to reduce the noise and user model complexity.
Our work is one major step on the road to make Bayesian hierarchical linear models more practical.
Evaluation on the Reuters data set showed that the new technique performed similar to the standard EM algorithm when the sparseness condition does not hold.
The research is important because scalability is a major concern for researchers when using the Bayesian hierarchical linear modeling approach to build
