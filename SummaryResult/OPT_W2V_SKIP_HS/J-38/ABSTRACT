We study the computational  complexity of two coalitional solution concepts for these  gamesthe Shapley value and the core.
We study coalitional games where the value of cooperation among the agents are solely determined by the attributes the agents possess, with no assumption as to how these  attributes jointly determine this value.
This framework  allows us to model diverse economic interactions by picking the right attributes.
We show how the positive results obtained in this paper imply comparable results for other games studied in the literature.
