Like the GVA, however, the MIP is computationally demanding and thus careful formulation of the MIP and optimizations based on the observed workloads from Mirage will be required to  ensure timely clearing of the auction.
Instead, the mechanism is a continuous scheme that accepts bids as they arrive and makes allocation decisions immediately, thus removing any need to clear auctions.
Strategyproofness or, minimally, making the system hard to manipulate is also key given the behavior we have observed.
The challenge is that the current literature is still restricted to non-combinatorial settings. 
Finally , another approach to eliminating S4 is to
