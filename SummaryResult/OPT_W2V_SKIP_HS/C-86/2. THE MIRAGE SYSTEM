Users compete for testbed resources by submitting bids which specify resource combinations of interest in space/time (e.g., any 32 MICA2 motes for 8 hours anytime in the next two days) along with a maximum value amount the user is willing to pay.
Lastly, as another measure of resource contention and the utility of driving resource allocation via user-specified  valuations, Figure 3 plots the median per-node clearing price for both MICA2 and MICA2DOT motes over time.
Valuations are also distributed relatively evenly across each order of magnitude , suggesting that these ranges are not due to a few anomalous bids but
