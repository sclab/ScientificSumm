Using this modified notation, we characterize the optimal  solution of follower l"s problem given the leaders k-uniform policy x, with the following optimality conditions: X j∈Q ql j = 1 al − X i∈X 1 k Cl ijxi ≥ 0 ql j(al − X i∈X 1 k Cl ijxi) = 0 ql j ≥ 0 Again, considering only optimal pure strategies for follower l"s problem we can linearize the complementarity constraint above.
We will show that ql , al , zl ij = xiql j is a feasible solution of (8) of same objective function value.
We denote by x
