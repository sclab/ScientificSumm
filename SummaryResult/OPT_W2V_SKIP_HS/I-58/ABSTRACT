Second, it provides strategies which are simple to  understand, represent, and implement.
First, ASAP searches for the highest-reward strategy, rather than a Bayes-Nash equilibrium, allowing it to find feasible strategies that exploit the natural first-mover advantage of the game.
Previous work has shown this problem of optimal strategy selection to be NP-hard.
However, it is often the case in multiagent security domains that one agent can commit to a mixed strategy which its adversaries observe before choosing their own strategies.
These domains can be modeled as Bayesian games; much work has been done on finding equilibria for such games.
We
