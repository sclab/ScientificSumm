The problem of choosing an optimal strategy for the leader to commit to in a Stackelberg game is analyzed in [5] and found to be NP-hard in the case of a Bayesian game with multiple types of followers.
In addition, since the Nash equilibrium assumes a simultaneous choice of strategies, the advantages of being the leader are not considered.
However, in many settings, a Nash or Bayes-Nash  equilibrium is not an appropriate solution concept, since it assumes that the agents" strategies are chosen simultaneously [5].
Then , in Section 4 the ASAP algorithm is presented for normal-form games ,
