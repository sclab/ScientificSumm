Second, it provides  strategies which are simple to understand, represent, and implement.
However most of this work is focused on either limiting energy consumption involved in patrolling [7] or optimizing on criteria like the length of the path traveled [4, 13], without reasoning about any explicit model of an adversary[14].
This contrasts with ASAP, where our emphasis is on a highly efficient heuristic approach that is not focused on equilibrium solutions.

First , ASAP searches for the highest reward strategy , rather than a Bayes-Nash equilibrium , allowing it to find feasible
