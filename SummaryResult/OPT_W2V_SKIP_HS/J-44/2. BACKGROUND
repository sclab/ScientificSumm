In both families of algorithms, neighborhoods are formed by first computing the similarity between all pairs of users (for user-based) or items (for item-based).
Predictions are then computed by aggregating ratings, which in a user-based algorithm involves aggregating the ratings of the target item by the user"s neighbors and, in an item-based algorithm, involves aggregating the user"s ratings of items that are neighbors of the target item.
We consider a user-based algorithm based on that defined for GroupLens [11] with variations from Herlocker et al.
Similarity computed in this manner is typically scaled by a factor
