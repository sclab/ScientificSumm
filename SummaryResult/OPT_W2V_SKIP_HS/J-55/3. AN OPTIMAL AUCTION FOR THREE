If any of the inequalities 1 ≤ x ≤ y are not strict, the same proof applies giving a lower bound on the auction"s profit; however, this bound may no longer be tight.
Furthermore, the auction raises exactly 6 13 F(2) on every input with non-identical bids.
This motivates considering symmetric scale-invariant auctions for three bidders with probability density function , ρ1 , x ( z ) , of the following form : ρ1 , x ( z ) = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 1 with discrete probability a ( x ) x with discrete probability b (
