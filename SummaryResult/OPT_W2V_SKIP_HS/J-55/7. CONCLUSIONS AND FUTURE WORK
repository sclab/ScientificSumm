The most interesting open question from our work is whether the lower bound from Theorem 2 can be matched by an auction for more than three bidders.
We also show that Î¥3 is not the best three-bidder auction for use in an aggregation auction, but the auction that beats it is able to reduce the competitive  ratio of the overall auction only a little bit.
Second, we consider whether our techniques can be extended to find optimal auctions for greater numbers of bidders.
We conjecture that it can.
The use of our analytic solution method requires knowledge of a restricted
