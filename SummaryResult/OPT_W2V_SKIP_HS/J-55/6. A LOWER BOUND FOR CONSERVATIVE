In order to  satisfy our lower bound, (4), on phk (b), it must put at least 3nr−2r−n n−1 on hk.
For any particular k and H we will be considering the bid vector b = (1, .
As this 180 lower bound is stronger than the lower bound of Theorem 2 for n ≥ 3, it shows that the optimal auction must occasionally charge a sales price higher than any bid in the input.
( 3 ) Equation ( 1 ) follows from the conservatism of A and ( 2 ) is from invoking the strong inductive hypothesis with H = kh
