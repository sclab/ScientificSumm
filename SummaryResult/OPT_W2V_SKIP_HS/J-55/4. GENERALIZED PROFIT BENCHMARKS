We can lower bound the competitive ratio of Υs,t 3 using the same worst-case distribution from [8] that we used against F(2) .
Note that the form of Υs,t 3 is essentially the same as for Υ3, but that the probability of each price is scaled depending on the values of s and t. That our auction for three bidders matches the lower bound  computed by the input distribution used in [8] is strong evidence that this input distribution is the worst-case input distribution for any number of bidders and any generalized profit benchmark.
We denote the optimal
