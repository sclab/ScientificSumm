We denote the profit of a truthful auction A on input b as A(b).
When specifying a symmetric  scaleinvariant auction we can assume that f is only a function of the relative magnitudes of the n âˆ’ 1 bids in b-i and that one of the bids, bj = 1.
ProfitExtractR: Given bids b, find the largest k such that the highest k bidders can equally share the cost R. Charge each of these bidders R/k.
In order to evaluate the performance of auctions with respect to the goal of profit maximization , we introduce the optimal single price omniscient
