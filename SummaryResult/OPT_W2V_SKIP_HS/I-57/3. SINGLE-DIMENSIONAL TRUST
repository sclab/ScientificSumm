The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.
Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).
Now , given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract , it should consider the expected utility that it will derive , E [ U ] ,
