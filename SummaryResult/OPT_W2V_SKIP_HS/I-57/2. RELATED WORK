He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.
By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more  principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.
Moreover , they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution , methods to discount the opinions of agents who
