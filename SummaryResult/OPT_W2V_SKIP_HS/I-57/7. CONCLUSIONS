Our starting point was an agent  estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet  distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent.
In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated dimensions.
This is a challenging extension, since in this case, the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution can not be used directly.
We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet
