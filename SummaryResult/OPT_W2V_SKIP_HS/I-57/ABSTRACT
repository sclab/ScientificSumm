We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised  reputation system.
We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions.
In this paper we develop a novel probabilistic model of  computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.
This solution uses the notion of private and shared information , and
