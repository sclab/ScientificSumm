We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the  Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct  experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above.
Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion ( since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context , the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked , and correlations
