• Dirichlet Distribution: We use the full Dirichlet  distribution, as described above, to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) including all its off-diagonal terms that represent the  correlations between the contract dimensions.
• Independent Beta Distributions: We use independent beta distributions to represent each contract dimension, in order to calculate ˆp(X), and then, as described earlier, we  approximate Cov(p(X)) and ignore the correlations by setting all the off-diagonal terms to zero.
At this point , it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case , ˆp ( o = 1 ) ,
