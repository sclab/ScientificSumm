on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1229 • C is a mapping from a resource to the cost of that resource, that is C(resource) : R → N+ We also make the following set of assumptions in our research: 1.
• ρ is a mapping from an executable method and resource to the quantity of that resource needed (by an agent) to  schedule/execute that method.
∃t∀iti = t, where t is the task structure of the problem that the MAS is trying to solve.
• R is the set of resources.
That is ρ ( method , resource )
