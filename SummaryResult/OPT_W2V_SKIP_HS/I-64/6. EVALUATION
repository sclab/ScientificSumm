Note that a static environment was used in each of these experiments, as we wanted to see the performance of the arrival rate and deadline slack on each of the three heuristics.
All shows the number of experimental sets in which there was no statistical difference between the three heuristics and a random allocation strategy one must redo the work, thus wasting precious time which might not be available close to a deadline.
For large contract net organizations , the number of tasks completed is statistically equivalent to the number completed by the OSD agents , however the number of
