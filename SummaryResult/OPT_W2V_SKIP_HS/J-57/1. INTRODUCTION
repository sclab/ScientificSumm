For example, for the recommendation system game, a highly compact  representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products, and let the algorithms that operate on the representation to compute the values of coalitions  appropriately.
The ideal representation should be fully expressive, i.e., it should be able to represent any coalitional games, use as little space as possible, have efficient algorithms for  computation, and be easy to use.
By  having a general representation and efficient algorithms that go with it, the representation will be useful as a prototyping tool for studying new economic situations.
