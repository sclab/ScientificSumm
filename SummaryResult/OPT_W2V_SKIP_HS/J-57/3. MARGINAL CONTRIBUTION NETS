Given a game represented as a MC-net, we can interpret the set of rules that make up the game as a graph.
To represent such a game without using negative literals, we will need 2n rules for n players: we need a rule of value 1 for each individual agent, a rule of value âˆ’1 for each pair of agents to counter the double-counting, a rule of value 1 for each triplet of agents, etc., similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle.
In the basic scheme , these patterns are conjunctions of agents , and S meets the requirement of the given
