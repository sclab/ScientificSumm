For rules that have only positive literals, the Shapley value of the agents is v/m, where v is the value of the rule and m is the number of agents in the rule.
For any group S, under the MC-nets  representation, v(S) is defined to be the sum over the values of all the rules that apply to S. Therefore, considering each rule as a game, by the (ADD) axiom discussed in section 2, the  Shapley value of the game created from aggregating all the rules is equal to the sum of the Shapley values over the rules.
