Since we want to test whether our algorithm can learn from the past queries, we also filter out those test cases whose queries can not retrieve at least 100 pseudo-documents from our history collection.
For each test case, i.e., each session, we count the number of different clicks and filter out those test cases with fewer than 4 clicks under the assumption that a query with more clicks is more likely to be an informational query.
On average, we have 6.23 and 5.89 clicks for each test case in the two test sets respectively. 
To test our algorithm , we
