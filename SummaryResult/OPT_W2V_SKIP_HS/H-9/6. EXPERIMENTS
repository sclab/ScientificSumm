In our experiments, we observe that the sizes of the best clusters are all larger than 5, and this ensures that P@5 is a meaningful metric.
We use Precision at 5 documents (P@5) in the best cluster as the primary measure to compare different methods.
To give a fair comparison across different organization  algorithms, we force both cluster-based and log-based  methods to output the same number of aspects and force each search result to be in one and only one aspect.
