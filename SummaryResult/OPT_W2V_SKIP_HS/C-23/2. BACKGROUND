The term Data Grid traditionally represents the network of distributed storage resources, from archival systems to caches and databases, which are linked using a logical name space to create global, persistent identifiers and provide uniform access mechanisms [4].
By using this mechanism, users of the Data Grid can easily manage replicas of data sets at their sites, with better performance.
In addition, the replica manager can perform access control on entire catalogs as well as on individual logical files.
The replica management service is responsible for managing the replication of complete and partial copies of datasets , defined as collections
