In the next experiment, we used the Recursive-Adjustment  CoAllocation strategy with various sets of replica servers and measured overall performances, where overall performance is: Total Performance = File size/Total Completion Time (5) Table 2 lists all experiments we performed and the sets of replica servers used.
These numbers were obtained by transferring files of 500MB, 1000MB, and 2000MB from a single replica server using our GridFTP client tool, and each number is an average over several runs.
(a) Overall performances for various sets of servers.
We observed that for our testbed and our co-allocation technology , overall performance reached its highest
