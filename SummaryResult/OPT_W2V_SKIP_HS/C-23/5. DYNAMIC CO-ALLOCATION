As Figure 2 shows, when an appropriate file section is first selected, it is divided into proper block sizes according to the respective server bandwidths.
When a threshold is reached, the co-allocation server stopped dividing the remainder of the file and assigns that remainder as the final section.
By contrast, lower threshold values will induce more frequent dynamic server workload adjustments and, in the case of greater network fluctuations, result in fewer differences in server transfer finish time.
The goal is to make the expected finish time of all servers the same.
Once the quickest server finishes its work at
