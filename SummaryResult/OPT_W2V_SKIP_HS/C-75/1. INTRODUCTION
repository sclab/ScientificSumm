These services are important for the implementation of a DIDSoG.
A Grid middleware provides several features for the realization of a DIDSoG, including [3]: decentralized coordination of resources; use of standard protocols and interfaces; and the delivery of optimized QoS (Quality of Service).
This characteristic is important for the integration of IDSs as the same service interfaces can be exposed by different IDSs.
Some reasons for integrating IDSs are described by the IDWG ( Intrusion Detection Working Group ) from the IETF ( Internet Engineering Task Force ) [ 12 ] as follows : â€¢ Many IDSs available in the
