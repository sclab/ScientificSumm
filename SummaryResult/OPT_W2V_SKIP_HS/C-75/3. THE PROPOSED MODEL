The functionalities of the registered resources in each of the scopes and complexity level can vary from one environment to another.
These resources then carry out the aggregation and correlation of the information from different domains and send it to the analysis resources in the first level of complexity in the third scope (level 3:1).
Level class identifies the level of target and complexity in which the resource acts.
The analysis resources in the second scope act like the analysis resources in the first scope , directing the information to a more complex analysis resource and putting the Countermeasure and
