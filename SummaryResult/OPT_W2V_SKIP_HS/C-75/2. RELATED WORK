In contrast, DIDSoG uses the Grid to compose a DIDS by integrating specific IDSs; the resulting DIDS could however be used to identify attacks in a Grid environment.
However, the possibility of applying heterogeneous detection systems is left for future work Another DIDS for Grids is presented by Choon and Samsudim [2].
[6] and [7] propose the use of Globus Toolkit for intrusion detection, especially for DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks; Globus is used due to the need to process great amounts of data to detect these kinds of attack.
However , the integration
