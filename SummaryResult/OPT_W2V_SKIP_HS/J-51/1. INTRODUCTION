In this paper, we study some fundamental computational questions concerning dominance and iterated dominance,  including how hard it is to check whether a given strategy can be eliminated by each of the variants of these notions.
Computing solutions according to ( iterated ) dominance is important for at least the following reasons : 1 ) it can be computationally easier than computing ( for instance ) a Nash equilibrium ( and therefore it can be useful as a preprocessing step in computing a Nash equilibrium ) , and 2 ) ( iterated ) dominance requires a weaker rationality assumption on
