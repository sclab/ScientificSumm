Specifically, to find out whether player i"s strategy σ∗ is dominated by a strategy that places positive probability on only k pure strategies, we can simply check, for every subset of k of player i"s pure strategies, whether there is a strategy that places positive probability only on these k strategies and dominates σ∗ , using Proposition 1.
In contrast , iterated weak dominance is known to be pathdependent.6 For example , in the following game , using iterated weak dominance we can eliminate M first , and then D , or R first , and then
