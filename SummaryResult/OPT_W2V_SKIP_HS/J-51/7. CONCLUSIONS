Finally, we can ask whether some of the algorithms we described (such as the one for iterated strict dominance with mixed strategies) can be made faster. 
Then, we showed that  iterated strict dominance becomes path-dependent when there is a limit on the support size of the dominating strategies, and that deciding whether a given strategy can be  eliminated by iterated strict dominance under this restriction is NP-complete (even when the limit on the support size is 3).
We showed that , unlike in normal form games , deciding whether a given pure strategy is dominated by another pure strategy in
