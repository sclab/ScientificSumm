This paper introduces dynamic semantics for ACLs as a method for dealing with some fundamental problems of agent communication in open systems, the simple  underlying idea being that different courses of agent behaviour can give rise to different interpretations of meaning of the  messages exchanged among agents.
Currently , we are working on fully-fledged specifications of dynamic semantics for more complex languages and on extending our approach to mentalistic semantics where we view statements about mental states as commitments regarding the rational implications of these mental states ( a simple example for this is that an agent commits itself to
