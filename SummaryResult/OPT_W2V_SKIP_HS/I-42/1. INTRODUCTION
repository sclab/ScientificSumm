It has been shown in [6] that any constraint graph can be mapped into a traditional pseudotree.
Search based  algorithms that originated from DisCSP typically use some form of backtracking [10] or bounds propagation, as in ADOPT [3].
Current algorithms that solve complete DCOPs use two main approaches: search and dynamic programming.
We then show that our Distributed Cross-edged Pseudotree Optimization Procedure (DCPOP) performs significantly better in practice than the original DPOP algorithm for some problem  instances.
With the advent of distributed AI , multi-agent systems became a popular way to model the complex interactions and coordination required to solve
