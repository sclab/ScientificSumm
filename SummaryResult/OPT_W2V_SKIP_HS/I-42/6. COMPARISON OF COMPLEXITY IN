We acknowledge that pseudotree  arrangements that allow parent-child relationships without an actual  constraint can solve the problem in Figure 3(a) with maximum  computation size of four domains.
We can see that the back-edges F-B and F-A overlap node C. Node C also has a parent E , and a back-edge with D. Using the original DPOP algorithm ( or DCPOP since they are identical in this case ) , we find that the computation at node C involves five domains : A , B , C , D , and E. In contrast , the cross-edged pseudotree arrangement in
