If node X also has branch-parents, then the utility  propagation message also contains a dimension for the domain of X, and will include a branch information structure.
Node B then merges the branch information structures from both messages because they have the same origination , node E. Since the number of merged branches originating from E is now 2 and the total branches originating from E is 2 , node B now eliminates the dimensions for domain E. Node B also eliminates the dimension for its own domain , leaving only information about domain A. Node B then sends a
