We have already shown that the total number of messages is linear with respect to the number of constraints in the DCOP  instance.
Since most of the problems in the second set were too complex to actually  compute the solution, we took measurements of the metrics using the techniques described earlier in Section 5 without actually solving the problem.
For our tests we generated 100 sample problems for each  combination of agents and meetings.
The values in the first five columns represent ( in left to right order ) , the total number of agents , the total number of
