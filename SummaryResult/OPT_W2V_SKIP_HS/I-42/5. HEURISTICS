Improved DFS based heuristics use a special procedure to choose the root node, and also provide an ordering function over the neighbors of a node to determine the order of path recursion.
The root then broadcasts the total complexity for that heuristic to all nodes.
For each v âˆˆ V we perform a place operation, and find the next node to place using the getBestNeighbor operation.
The actual DCPOP algorithm has worst case exponential complexity, but we can calculate the maximum message size, computation size, and sequential path cost for a given cross-edged pseudotree in  linear space-time complexity.
