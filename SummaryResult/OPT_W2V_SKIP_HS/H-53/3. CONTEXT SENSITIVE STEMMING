In addition, for a query with multiple words that can be transformed, or a word with multiple variants, not all of the expansions are useful.
To test whether an expansion is useful, we have to know whether the expanded query is likely to get more relevant documents from the Web, which can be quantified by the probability of the query occurring as a string on the Web.
The rationale of using distributional word similarity is that true variants tend to be used in similar contexts.
However, not every occurrence of comparison in the document is of interest.
Considering the fact
