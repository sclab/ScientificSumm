Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the user"s information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.
We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.
One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = ( Q1 , ... , Qi−1 ) , but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to
