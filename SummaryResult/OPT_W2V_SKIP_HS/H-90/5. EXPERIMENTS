When µ is set to 0, the query history is not used at all, and we essentially just use the clickthrough data  combined with the current query.
The best performance is generally achieved when µ is around 2.0, which means that the past query information is as useful as about 2 words in the current query.
Actually, in many cases with q2, using the context may hurt the performance, probably because the history at that point is sparse.
As we would expect , an excessively large µ would hurt the performance in general , but q2 is hurt most and
