We have seen that the system is well behaved if the agents all follow a threshold strategy; we now want to show that there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium where they do so (that is, a Nash equilibrium where all the agents use Sk for some k > 0.)
All that Theorem 4.1 shows is that, among best responses, there is at least one that is a threshold strategy.
However , as long as Î´ is sufficiently close to 1 , we can ignore what happens during the period that the system is not in steady state.3 We have thus far
