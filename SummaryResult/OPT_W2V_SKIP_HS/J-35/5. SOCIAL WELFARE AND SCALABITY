Thus, for now, we assume that the cost is set as a function of the number of agents in the system (and that there is no possibility for agents to satisfy a request for less than the official cost or for requesters to offer to pay more than it). 
From the point of view of the system designer , not all equilibria are equally good ; we want an equilibrium where as few as possible agents have $ 0 when they get a chance to make a request ( so that they can pay for the request ) and relatively
