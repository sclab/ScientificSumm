â€¢ ut i denotes agent i"s utility in round t. A standard agent is one whose utility is determined as discussed in the introduction; namely, the agent gets 2 For large n, our model converges to one in which players make requests in real time, and the time between a player"s requests are exponentially distributed with mean 1.
This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel , so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G
