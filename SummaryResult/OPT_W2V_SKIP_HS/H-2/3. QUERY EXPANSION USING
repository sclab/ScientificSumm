Thus, we first identify the set of terms closely related to each query keyword, and then we calculate the Desktop co-occurrence level of each of these  possible expansion terms with the entire initial search request.
Of course, in reality we know these terms are not independent in text, and we only use the statistical metrics to highlight terms which are frequently appearing together.
In general, the relative differences between our algorithms were similar to those observed for the log based queries.
During the run-time phase , having the terms most correlated with each particular query keyword already identified , one
