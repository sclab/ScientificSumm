Thus, more experiments are needed in order to determine the  optimal number of generated expansion keywords, as a function of the query ambiguity level.
â€¢ The Query Clarity [7] seems to be the best, as well as the most applied technique so far.
Given the algorithms and clarity measures, we implemented the adaptivity procedure by tailoring the amount of expansion terms added to the original query, as a function of its ambiguity in the Web, as well as within user"s PIR.
The newly proposed adaptive personalized query expansion algorithms are denoted as A [ LCO/TF ] for the
