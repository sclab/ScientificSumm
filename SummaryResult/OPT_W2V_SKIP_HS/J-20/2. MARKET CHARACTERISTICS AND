Finally, although our  algorithms can handle more general weight functions, patients have a utility of 1 for compatible donors, since their survival probability is not affected by the choice of donor [3].
Briefly, the process involves generating patients with a random blood type, sex, and probability of being tissue-type incompatible with a randomly chosen donor.
