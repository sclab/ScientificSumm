The limited-information aspect is that even in batch mode, the graph provided as input is not completely correct: a number of donor-donee pairs believed to be compatible turn out to be incompatible when more expensive last-minute tests are performed.
We can also support forcing part of the allocation, for example, This acutely sick teenager has to get a kidney if possible.
Our work has treated the kidney exchange as a batch problem with full information (at least in the short run,  kidney exchanges will most likely continue to run in batch mode every so often).
