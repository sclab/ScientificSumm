Alternatively, we can solve the problem by encoding it as an ILP with one variable for each edge in the original market graph G. This ILP, given below, has the advantage that it can be extended naturally to deal with cycle length constraints.
If cycles are allowed to have length at most L, it is easy to see that we only need to make the following changes to the ILP.
If so, we generate a set of these constraints, add them to the ILP, and repeat.
AN EDGE FORMULATION In this section , we consider a formulation of the clearing
