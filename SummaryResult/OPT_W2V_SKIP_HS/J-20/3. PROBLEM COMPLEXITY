Given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer L ≥ 3, the problem of deciding if G admits a perfect cycle cover containing cycles of length at most L is NP-complete.
One straightforward idea is to construct a tripartite graph with vertex sets X ∪ Y ∪ Z and directed edges (xa, yb), (yb, zc), and (zc, xa) for each triple ti = {xa, yb, zc} ∈ T. However, it is not too hard to see that this encoding fails because a perfect cycle cover may include a cycle with no corresponding triple.
