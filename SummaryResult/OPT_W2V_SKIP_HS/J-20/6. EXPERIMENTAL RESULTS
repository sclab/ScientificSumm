In each of the next two algorithms, we turn one of these optimizations off to highlight its effectiveness.
As in many column generation problems, the tailing-off effect is substantial.
We begin with the following settings (all optimizations are switched on): Category Setting Column Seeder Combination of greedy exchange and maximum-weight matching heuristics, and random walk seeder (400,000 cycles).
By taking advantage of the properties of our problem, we manage to clear a market with 10,000 patients in about the same time it would otherwise have taken to clear a 6000 patient market. 
However , at 5000 vertices , this effect
