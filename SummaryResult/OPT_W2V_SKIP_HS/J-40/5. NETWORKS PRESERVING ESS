The following theorem relaxes this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have n1+γ edges, for some constant γ > 0, in which case it shows there will alway be at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.
Then via a standard Chernoff bound argument, one can show that with high probability, the fraction of mutants neighboring i and the fraction of mutants neighboring j is in the range (1 ± τ)(g(n)−h(n)) g(n) .
Finally by Lemma 5.1, we know there are at most o(n)  mutants of abnormal fitness.
It states that for
