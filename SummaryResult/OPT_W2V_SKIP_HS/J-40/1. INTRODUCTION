This extension generalizes the classical setting, in which all pairs of organisms in an infinite population are equally likely to interact.
More generally, as evolutionary game theory has become a plausible model not only for  biological interaction, but also economic and other kinds of  interaction in which certain dynamics are more imitative than optimizing (see [2, 16] and chapter 4 of [19]), the network constraints may come from similarly more general sources.
There are many obvious reasons why one would like to examine more general graphs , the primary one being in that many scenarios considered in evolutionary game theory
