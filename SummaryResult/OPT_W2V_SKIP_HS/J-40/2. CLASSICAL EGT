Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the  population [17].
A consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ESS, it must be the case that F(s|s) â‰¥ F(t|s), for all strategies t. This inequality means that s must be a best response to itself, and thus any ESS strategy s must also be a Nash equilibrium.
In general the notion of ESS is more  restrictive than Nash equilibrium, and not all 2-player, symmetric games have an ESS.
