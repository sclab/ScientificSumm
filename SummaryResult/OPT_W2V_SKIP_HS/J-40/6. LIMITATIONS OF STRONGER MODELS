Theorem 5.3 stated that if s is a classical ESS, then for graphs where |En| ≥ n1+γ , for some γ > 0, and where each organism is labeled a mutant with probability , one edge must contract.
Similarly, in the proof of Theorem 6.2, observe that the only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself, which has fitness F(t|s).
Also observe that there is only 1 incumbent in the neighborhood of j, namely i.
( Sketch ) With probability approaching 1 as n → ∞ , there exists a vertex j where deg ( j ) is arbitrarily close
