In these three works, the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to reproduce, and analyze properties of the graph that allow a strategy to overrun the population.
We consider more general games than the first model and more general graphs than the second.
In [8], [3], and [4], the authors consider specific families of graphs, such as cycles and lattices, where players play specific games, such as 2 × 2-games or k × k-coordination games.
The model we propose is more general than both of these , as it encompasses a larger class of graphs as well as a
