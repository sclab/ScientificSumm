I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 
To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.
Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.
