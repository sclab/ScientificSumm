As opposed to the above works, our work focuses on vehicular networks, in which the agents are constantly roaming the network and exchanging data.
This is mainly due to the dynamic nature of the list of neighbors in transportation networks.
In addition, the system in transportation networks has a  feedback mechanism, since the load in the roads depends on the reports and the movement of the agents themselves.
However, their work concentrates on the movement of the data itself, and not on the agents who propagate the data.
This is different from our scenario in which each agent maintains the
