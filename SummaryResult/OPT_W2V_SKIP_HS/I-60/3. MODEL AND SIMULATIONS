In each iteration the same agents are used with the same origin and destination points, whereas the data collected in earlier iterations is preserved in the future iterations (referred to as the history of the agent).
To gain statistical significance we ran each simulation with changes in the set of the gossip agents, and the set of the self-interested agents.
For example , if an average journey length of a certain agent in iteration 1 with no selfinterested agent was 50 , and the length was 60 in the same scenario and iteration in which self-interested agents were involved ,
