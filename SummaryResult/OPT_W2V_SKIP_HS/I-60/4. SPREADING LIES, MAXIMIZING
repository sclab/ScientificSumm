In the next section we describe another scenario for the self-interested agents, in which they are not concerned with their own utility, but rather interested in maximizing the average journey length of other gossip agents. 
It is also interesting to note the large value attained by the self-interested agents in the first iteration.
We also assume that the objective of the self-interested agents is to minimize their own journey length, thus they spread lies on their routes, as described in Section 4.1.
As opposed to the first set of experiments , in this set the self-interested agents were selected randomly
