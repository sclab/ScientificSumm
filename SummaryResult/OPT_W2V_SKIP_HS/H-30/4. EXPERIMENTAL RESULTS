Another interesting result is that the MRF model is  statistically equivalent to relevance models on the two web data sets.
Although we only provided the concepts generated for a single query, we note that the same analysis and conclusions generalize across other data sets, with coherent, topically related concepts being consistently generated using LCE.
However, since our model is based on a number of different features over various types of cliques, it is more general and robust than a bigram model.
using the sequential dependence assumption, expanding with single term concepts, and using our feature set).
Our model uses both
