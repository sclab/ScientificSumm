In this work, we show how the model can be extended and used for query  expansion using a technique that we call latent concept expansion (LCE).
First, LCE provides a mechanism for combining term  dependence with query expansion.
For this reason, there has been a strong interest in query expansion techniques.
Recently, a Markov random field (MRF) model for  information retrieval was proposed that goes beyond the  simplistic bag of words assumption that underlies BM25 and the (unigram) language modeling approach to information  retrieval [20, 22].
There have been several approaches that make use of generalized concepts , however such
