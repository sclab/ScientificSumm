LCE is novel in that it performs single or multi-term expansion within a framework that allows the modeling of term dependencies and the use of arbitrary  features, whereas previous work has been based on the bag of words assumption and term occurrence features.
It was also shown the MRF model itself, without any query expansion, outperforms relevance models on large web data sets.
The technique was shown to be a natural extension of the Markov random field model for information retrieval and a generalization of  relevance models.
We also showed that the model is highly effective.
This reconfirms previous observations
