For maximum  robustness, we use a different set of parameters for FQD(Q, D) and FQD(E, D), which allows us to weight the term, ordered, and unordered window features differently for the original query and the candidate expansion concept.
These variants are full  independence, where each query term is independent of each other given a document, sequential dependence, which  assumes a dependence exists between adjacent query terms, and full dependence, which makes no independence  assumptions.
dependencies between adjacent query terms ) , it is important to note that both the original query and the expansion concepts can use any
