In this paper, we propose a robust query expansion technique based on the Markov random field model for information retrieval.
We also  describe how our technique can be used to generate  meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query  suggestion/reformulation.
Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond  simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques.
The technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during  expansion.
Query expansion , in the form of pseudo-relevance feedback or relevance feedback , is a common
