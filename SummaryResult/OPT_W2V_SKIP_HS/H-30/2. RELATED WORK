The only difference  between the two approaches is that relevance models do not explicitly model the relevant or pseudo-relevant documents.
One of the classic and most widely used approaches to query expansion is the Rocchio algorithm [21].
Rocchio"s  approach, which was developed within the vector space model, reweights the original query vector by moving the weights towards the set of relevant or pseudo-relevant documents and away from the non-relevant documents.
A number of formalized query expansion techniques have been developed for the language modeling framework , including Zhai and Lafferty '' s model-based feedback and Lavrenko and Croft
