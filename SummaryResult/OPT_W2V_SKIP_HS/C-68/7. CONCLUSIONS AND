FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this study, we examined the improvements in latency that can be obtained in the presence of carriers that deliver a data item from a server to a client.
We are currently  analyzing the performance of zebroids on a real world data set  comprising of an ad-hoc network of buses moving around a small  neighborhood in Amherst [4].
This will also serve as a validation for the utility of the Markov mobility model used in this study.
To better reflect reality we would like to validate the observations obtained from this study with some real world simulation
