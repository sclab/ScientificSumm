Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.
We employ a replication scheme that allocates replicas for a data item as a function of the square-root of the frequency of access of that item.
Note that the replacements performed by the zebroids will cause changes to the data item replica distribution.
In all the simulation results, each point is an average of 200,000 requests.
Here , we set the
