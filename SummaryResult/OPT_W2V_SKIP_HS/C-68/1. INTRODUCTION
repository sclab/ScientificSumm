In a typical scenario, an AutoMata device presents a passenger with a list of data items1 , showing both the name of each data item and its availability latency.
A novel  characteristic of our study is the impact on availability latency for a given database repository of items.
The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles.
The technical feasibility of
