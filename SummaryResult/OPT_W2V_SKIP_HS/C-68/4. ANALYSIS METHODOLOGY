Although for sparse density scenarios, the independence assumption does hold, it is no longer valid when N approaches G. • Let the size of data item repository of interest be T. Also, data item i has ri replicas.
Extensions to the analysis that also consider finite trip durations can be obtained in [9].
This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value ( note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G > > ri ) : δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all
