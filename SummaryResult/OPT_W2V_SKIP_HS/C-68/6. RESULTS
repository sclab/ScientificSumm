This is because in sparse scenarios, the  transitive hand-offs between the zebroids creates higher number of  replicas for the requested data item, yielding lower availability latency.
Finally, the analysis captures a  oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.
When the storage is extremely scarce so that only one replica per data item exists in the AutoMata network, the number of replacements performed by the zebroids is zero since any replacement will cause a data item to be lost from the system.
However , there is a storage spectrum in the middle where
