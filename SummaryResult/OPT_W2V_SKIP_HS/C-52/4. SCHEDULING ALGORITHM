4.5 Steps of the Scheduling Algorithm For the purpose of the discussion below, as before let us denote the accumulated relative export error at a sender for receiver k up until DRi to be Ri k. Let us denote the scheduled delay at the sender before DRi is sent to receiver k as Î´i k. Given the above discussion, the algorithm steps are as follows: 1.
When this information arrives at a later time , Ri k will be computed and accumulated to future relative export errors ( for example Ri+1 k if dak is received before DRi+2 is computed
