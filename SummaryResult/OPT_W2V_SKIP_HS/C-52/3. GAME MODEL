This trajectory is followed until a new DR vector is received which changes the position and/or velocity of the entity.
This is not shown in the figure but it serves to remind the reader that the export error is cumulative when a sequence of DR vectors are received.
Based on this model, Figure 1 illustrates the sending and  receiv1 Other type of DR vectors include quadratic DR vectors which specify the acceleration of the entity and cubic spline DR vectors that consider the starting position and velocity and the ending  position and velocity of the entity.
Thus , the DR
