In this paper, we present a user study of a technique that exploits the searching and browsing behavior of many users to suggest popular Web pages, referred to as destinations henceforth, in addition to the regular search results.
Radlinski and Joachims [13] have utilized such collective user intelligence to improve retrieval accuracy by using sequences of consecutive query reformulations, yet their approach does not consider users" interactions beyond the search result page.
We conjecture that destinations popular across a large number of users can capture the collective user experience for information needs, and our results support this hypothesis.
