Our findings also show that our subjects felt that QueryDestination produced more relevant and useful suggestions for exploratory tasks than the other systems.11 All other observed differences between the systems were not statistically significant.12 The difference between performance of QueryDestination and SessionDestination is explained by the approach used to generate destinations (described in Section 2).
Subjects found the search easier on QuerySuggestion and QueryDestination than the other systems for known-item tasks.4 For exploratory tasks , only searches conducted on QueryDestination were easier than on the other systems.5 Subjects indicated that exploratory tasks on the three non-baseline systems were more stressful
