From a computational game theory point of view, an additional benefit of a strong equilibrium is that it has a potential to reduce the distance between the optimal solution and the solution obtained as an outcome of selfish behavior.
As far as we know, we are the first to provide a topological characterization for equilibrium existence in multi-commodity and single-source network games.
While the fair cost sharing games we study are utility increasing network  congestion games, we derive a different characterization than [19] due to the different assumptions regarding the players" actions.3 
For the case of a single source
