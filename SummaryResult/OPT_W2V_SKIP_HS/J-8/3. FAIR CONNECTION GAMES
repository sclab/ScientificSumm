Let S be a SE in Λ1 that minimizes the cost of players in T2 (such a SE exists by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 3.2).
S1 = {a, b, c}, 7 In any NE of the game, player 1 will buy the edge e and player 2 will buy the edge f. This is since the alternate path, in the respective part, will cost the player 2.5.
The k-SPoA of a fair connection game with nondecreasing concave edge cost functions and n players is at most n k · H(k).
Let Λ be a fair connection game on the
