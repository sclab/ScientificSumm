An extension parallel graph (EPG) is a graph G consisting of either: (1) a single directed edge (s, t), (2) a graph G = G1||G2 or (3) a graph G = G1 →e G2, where G1 and G2 are 5 We limit the players to select a path connecting si to ti and payment only on those edges.
6 This implies that in equilibrium every player has its sink and source connected by a path in Gp.
A pure Nash equilibrium S ∈ Σ is a k-strong equilibrium , if there is no coalition Γ of size at most k , such
