Our main existence results are the following: (1) For a single source and sink we show that there is always a strong equilibrium (both for fair and general connection games).
(2) For a single source multiple sinks we show that for a series parallel graph a strong equilibrium always exists (both for fair and general connection games).
For single source general connection games and single source single sink fair  connection games, we show that a strong equilibrium is always an optimal solution.
We study the graph topologies that guarantee the existence of a strong equilibrium ( where no coalition can
