Next we show that no player k > i pays for any edge on any path from s to ti.
(The set B will include any edge e ∈ B for which there is no other edge e ∈ B on the path from e to the source s.) Considering the edges in e ∈ B we can see that any subtree T∗ e we delete from T can not decrease the difference between the payments and the cost of the remaining tree.
Recall that given two vertices u , v on path ¯Q we denote by ¯Qu , v the
