The reason why the Meehl index is better may be that this descriptors generates descriptions with elements that have very similar variance.
135 best distance measures per descriptor, Section 5.2 shows the best overall distance measures and Section 5.3 points out other interesting results (for example, distance measures that work particularly good on specific ground truth groups).
Additional advantages of pattern difference are that it usually has a very low variance andbecause it is a predicate-based measure - its discriminance ( and cluster structure ) can be tuned with parameter p. The best measure for Dominant Color turned out to
