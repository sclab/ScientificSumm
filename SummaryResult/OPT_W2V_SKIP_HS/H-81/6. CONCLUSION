The evaluation presented in this paper aims at testing the recommended distance measures and finding better ones for the basic visual MPEG-7 descriptors.
This work offers suitable distance measures for various situations.
In consequence, the distance measures identified as the best will be implemented in the open MPEG-7 based visual information retrieval framework VizIR [4].
The work presented in this paper is part of the VizIR project funded by the Austrian Scientific Research Fund FWF under grant no.
In the evaluation the best overall distance measures for visual content - as extracted by the visual MPEG-7 descriptors - turned out
