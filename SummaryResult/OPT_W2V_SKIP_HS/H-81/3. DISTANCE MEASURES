Between these limits, a distance measure that uses the quantisation model is - depending on p - more or less discriminant for properties.
The major advantages of the quantisation model are: (1) it is application domain independent, (2) the implementation is straightforward, (3) the model is easy to use and finally, (4) the new parameter p allows to control the similarity measurement process in a new way (discriminance on property level).
p is an additional criterion for the behaviour of a distance measure and determines the thresholds used in the operators.
Each measure implementing the model can be used as a substitute
