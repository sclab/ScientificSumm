Obviously, the main task of good distance measures is to reorganise descriptor space in a way that media objects with the highest similarity are nearest to the query object.
In the following distance measures of both groups of approaches will be considered. 
Goal of the measurement process is to express a relationship between the two objects by their distance.
Other descriptors are based on low-level descriptors or semantic information: Group-of-Frames/Group-of-Pictures Color (based on Scalable Color), Shape 3D (based on 3D mesh information), Motion Trajectory (based on object segmentation) and Face Recognition (based on face extraction).
If multiple descriptors are used
