Corollary 3.4 There exist prices P such that the  mechanism (f, P) is truthful iff f satisfies cycle monotonicity.1 We now consider our specific scheduling domain.
Cycle monotonicity is best described in the abstract social choice setting: there is a finite set A of alternatives, there are m players, and each player has a private type  (valuation function) v : A → R, where vi(a) should be interpreted as i"s value for alternative a.
(Strictly speaking, we should use A = f(Vi, v−i) instead of A here.)
A mechanism is a tuple ( f , { Pi }
