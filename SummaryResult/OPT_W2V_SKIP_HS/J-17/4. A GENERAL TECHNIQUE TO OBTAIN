Theorem 4.4 Suppose algorithm A satisfies the conditions in Algorithm 1 and returns a makespan of at most cÂ·OPT(p) for every p. Then, the algorithm A constructed above is a 2c-approximation, cycle-monotone fractional algorithm.
This conversion works even when the approximation algorithm returns only a fractional schedule (satisfying certain properties) of makespan at most c Â· OPT(p) for every instance p. We prove truthfulness by showing that the fractional algorithm satisfies cycle  monotonicity (3).
Algorithm 1 Let A be any algorithm that on any input p outputs a possibly fractional assignment x such that xij > 0 implies
