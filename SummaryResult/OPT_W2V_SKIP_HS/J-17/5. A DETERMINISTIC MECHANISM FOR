If pij = L, then we must have ni p,T ∗(p) = T∗ (p), otherwise we could have assigned j to i in step 2 to obtain a flow of larger value.
So suppose OPT(p) ≥ H. By Claim 5.5, we know that T∗ (p) ≤ OPT(p) + L. If there are no unassigned jobs after step 2 of the algorithm, then the makespan is at most T∗ (p) and we are done.
Also none of the jobs that are counted in n2,1 L are assigned by x since each such job j is high on i in p2
