This is one of the very few known results that use an approximation algorithm in a black-box fashion to obtain a truthful mechanism for a multidimensional problem.
The gap between the single-dimensional and multidimensional domains is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that [3] showed that there  exists a truthful mechanism that always outputs an optimal schedule.
Thus, they retain the core property underlying the hardness of truthful mechanism design for unrelated machines, and by studying these special settings we hope to gain some insights that will be useful for tackling the general problem.
Truthfulness in such domains is equivalent
