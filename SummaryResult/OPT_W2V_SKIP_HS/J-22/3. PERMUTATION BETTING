The simpler one is to find a subset of orders that can be matched risk-free, namely a subset of orders which accepted together give a nonnegative profit to the auctioneer in every possible outcome.
(1) Similarly we can define the existence of a match with  divisible orders.
The auctioneer in a subset betting market faces a  nontrivial matching problem, that is to determine which orders to accept among all submitted orders i âˆˆ O.
Assuming qe = 1 for all e , this is a cycle C with a total of |C| edges such that the worst-case profit for the
