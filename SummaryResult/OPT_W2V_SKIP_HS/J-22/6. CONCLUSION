Interesting open questions for our permutation betting  include the computational complexity of optimal indivisible matching for subset betting and the necessary condition for the existence of a match in pair betting markets.
While it is  unnatural and intractable to allow traders to bet directly on the n!
We find that in a subset betting  market an auctioneer can find the optimal set and quantity of orders to accept such that his worst-case profit is maximized in polynomial time if orders are divisible.
The complexity changes dramatically for pair betting.
In a subset betting market , traders can bet either on
