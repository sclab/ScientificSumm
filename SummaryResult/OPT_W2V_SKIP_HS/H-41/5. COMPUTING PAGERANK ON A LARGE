Since over 80% of all  hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.
Using each of these databases, we computed HITS authority and hub scores for various  parameterizations of the sampling operator S, sampling  between 1 and 100 back-links of each page in the root set.
The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.
Assuming that
