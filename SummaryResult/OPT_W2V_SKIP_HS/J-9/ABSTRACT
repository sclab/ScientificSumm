We show that securities whose payoffs cannot be expressed as weighted threshold functions of distributed input bits are not guaranteed to converge to the proper equilibrium  predicted by economic theory.
We investigate the computational process on the path toward equilibrium, where information distributed among traders is revealed step-by-step over time and incorporated into the market price.
On the other hand, securities whose payoffs are threshold functions are guaranteed to  converge, for all prior probability distributions.
We develop a simplified model of an information market, along with trading strategies, in order to formalize the computational properties of the process.
