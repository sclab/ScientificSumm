A more satisfying approach would be to  assume only rationality and solve for the resulting  gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current  computational model or another model of an information market.
Some  interesting and important next steps include gaining a better understanding of the following: â€¢ The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have  assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited precision; in practice, this will not be true.
It is interesting to ask whether we would get very different results for generic prior distributions.
For example , can we find a good distributed-computational model of a
