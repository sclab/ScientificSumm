In this paper, we propose to use CLQS as an alternative to query translation, and test its effectiveness in CLIR tasks.
Then a monolingual IR system based on the BM25 model [23] is called using each }{ eqqâˆˆ as queries to retrieve documents.
QUERY SUGGESTION In Section 3, we presented a discriminative model for cross lingual query suggestion.
Then the retrieved documents are re-ranked based on the sum of the BM25 scores associated with each monolingual retrieval. 
The resulting good performance of CLIR corresponds to the high quality of the suggested queries.
Given a source query fq , a set of
