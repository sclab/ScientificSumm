We believe that distributed solutions to the winner determination problem should be studied as they offer a better fit for some  applications as when, for example, agents do not want to reveal their valuations to the auctioneer.
Thus,  several approaches and algorithms have been proposed to  address the winner determination problem.
The practical applications of combinatorial auctions include: allocation of airport takeoff and landing time slots, procurement of freight transportation services, procurement of public transport services, and industrial procurement [2].
The PAUSE ( Progressive Adaptive User Selection Environment ) auction [ 4 , 5 ] is one of a few
