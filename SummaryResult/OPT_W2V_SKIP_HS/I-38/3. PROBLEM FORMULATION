(2) That is, the agent"s utility for a bidset W is the value it receives for the items it wins in W minus the price it must pay for those items.
Formally , given that W is the current winning bidset , agent i must find a g∗ i such that r ( g∗ i ) ≥ r ( W ) + and g∗ i = arg max g⊆2B ui ( g ) , ( 3 ) where each g is a set of bids that covers all items and ∀b∈g ( b ∈ B ) or (
