The cases where our algorithms failed to arrive at the  distribution of the revenue-maximizing solution are those where there was a large gap between the first and second  valuation for a set (or sets) of items.
Notice also that our value generation algorithm (Figure 5) generates a number of bids that is exponential on the number of items, as might be expected in many situations.
In order to do our tests we had to generate value functions for the agents1 .
In the case of 2 items both algorithms produce in average a revenue proportion of 67.4 % , while in
