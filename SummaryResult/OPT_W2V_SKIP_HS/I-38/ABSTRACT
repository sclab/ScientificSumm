It is an increasing price  combinatorial auction that naturally distributes the problem of  winner determination amongst the bidders in such a way that they have an incentive to perform the calculation.
We have developed a couple of bidding algorithms for the bidders in a PAUSE auction.
The PAUSE  auction is one of a few efforts to release the auctioneer from having to do all the work (it might even be possible to get rid of the auctioneer).
However, most of the existing winner determination algorithms for combinatorial auctions are centralized.
In this paper we present our bidding algorithms , discuss
