A final pruning technique implemented by the algorithm is ignoring any branches where the agent has no bids in the current answer g and no more of the agent"s bids are in the list (pbsearch lines 6 and 7).
We set the value of n before calling cpbsearch , to be the size of the list bids ( cachedpausebid line 21 ) in case i ) , since we want cpbsearch to search over all bids ; and we set n to be the number of bids from B included in bids ( cachedpausebid line 23 ) in
