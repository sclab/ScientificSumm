In this paper, we are interested in the restriction of the causality relation to the subset of events defined as being the relevant events of the computation.
Section 4 improves this protocol by providing the general condition that allows a message to carry control information whose size can be smaller than n. Section 5 provides instantiations of this condition.
Usually , according to the problem he focuses on , a designer is interested only in a subset of the events produced by a distributed execution ( e.g. , only the checkpoint events are meaningful when one is interested in determining
