From these figures, we observe that, whatever the time distribution  followed by the relevant events, both IPT2 and IPT3 exhibit a behavior better than IPT1 (i.e., the total number of  piggybacked triples is lower in IPT2 and IPT3 than in IPT1), even in the worst case (see Figure 3.d).
In fact, as discussed in Section 5.3, the  management of matrix Mi within IPT2 does not allow a transitive transmission of information but only a direct transmission of this information.
On the one hand , when observing Figure 3.b where a large number of relevant events are taken in a very
