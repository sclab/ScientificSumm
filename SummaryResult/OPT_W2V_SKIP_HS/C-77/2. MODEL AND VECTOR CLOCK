Throughout the paper, we will use the following notation: if e ∈ Hi is not the first event produced by Pi, then pred(e) denotes the event immediately preceding e in the sequence Hi.
If e is the first event produced by Pi, then pred(e) is denoted by ⊥ (meaning that there is no such event), and ∀e ∈ Hi : ⊥ < e. The partial order bH = (H, hb →)  constitutes a formal model of the distributed computation it is associated with.
The sequence of relevant events produced by process Pi is denoted by Ri , and R = ∪n
