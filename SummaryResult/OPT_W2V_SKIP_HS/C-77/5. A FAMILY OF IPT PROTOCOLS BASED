ON EVALUABLE CONDITIONS It results from the previous theorem that, if Pi could evaluate K(m, k) when it sends m to Pj, this would  allow us improve the previous IPT protocol in the following way: in rule R2, the triple (k, V Ci[k], IPi[k]) is  transmitted with m only if Â¬K(m, k).
In fact , as explained Section 5.1 , the predicate c ( locally implemented by the matrix M ) was based on the existence of a message m sent by Pj to Pi , piggybacking the triple ( k , m .V C [
