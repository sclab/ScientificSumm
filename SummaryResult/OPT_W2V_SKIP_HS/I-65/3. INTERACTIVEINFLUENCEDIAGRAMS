As we  mentioned previously, the values of the node Mod[Mj] denote the  different models of the other agent, and its distribution is the agent i"s belief over the models of j conditioned on the physical state.
Given the distributions over the actions within the different chance nodes (one for each model of the other agent), the level 1 I-ID is transformed as shown in Fig.
node , I-IDs differ from IDs by having a dashed link ( called the policy link in [ 15 ] ) between the model node and a chance node , Aj ,
