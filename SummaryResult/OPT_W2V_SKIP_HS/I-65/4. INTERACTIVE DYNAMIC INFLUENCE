Expansion of the I-DID over more time steps requires the  repetition of the two steps of updating the set of models that form the 2 Note that Oj represents j"s observation at time t + 1.
The probability that j '' s updated model is , say mt+1,1 j , lâˆ’1 , depends on the probability of j performing the action and receiving the observation that led to this model , and the prior distribution over the models at time step t. Because the chance node At j assumes the distribution of each of the action nodes based on
