I-DIDs address this gap by allowing the representation of other agents" models as the values of a special model node.
They generalize POMDPs [13] to multiagent settings by including the other agents" computable models in the state space along with the states of the physical environment.
Furthermore, we clarify the semantics of the special purpose policy link introduced in the representation of I-DID by [15], and show that it could be replaced by traditional dependency links.
In the previous representation of the I-DID , the update of the agent '' s belief over the models of others as
