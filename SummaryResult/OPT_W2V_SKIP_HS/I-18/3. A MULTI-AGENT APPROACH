3.4 Problem formalization Then, our problem is the following: we would like each agent to build request allocations (i.e a plan) dynamically such as if these requests are carried out their number is the highest possible or the global cost is minimal.
In the sequel , we will note Rt si the set of the requests that are known by agent si at time t ∈ T. For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value , noted costsi ( R ) ∈ R , representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg (
