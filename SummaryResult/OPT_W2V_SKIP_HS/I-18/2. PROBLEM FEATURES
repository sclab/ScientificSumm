A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar  areas, and thus can communicate without the ground  intervention.
Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.
The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.
The features of the problem are the following : - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation ; -
