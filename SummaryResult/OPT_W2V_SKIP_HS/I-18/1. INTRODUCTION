Much research has been undertaken to increase satellite autonomy such as enabling them to solve by themselves problems that may occur during a mission, adapting their behaviour to new events and transferring planning on-board ; even if the development cost of such a satellite is increased, there is an increase in performance and mission possibilities [34].
The objective of this work is to use intersatellite connections , called InterSatellite Links or ISL , in an Earth observation constellation inspired from the Fuego
