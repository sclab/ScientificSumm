Although agents constrain themselves on the number of observations, the average cost is widely reduce. 
For each scenario, six simulations have been performed: one with centralized planning (all requests are planned by the ground station before the simulation), one where agents are isolated (they cannot communicate nor coordinate with one another), one informed simulation (agents only  communicate requests) and three other simulations implementing the instanciated collaboration strategies (politics): - neutral politics: α, and λ are set to average values; - drastic politics: α and λ are set to higher values, i.e.
In the general case , using communication and strategies allows
