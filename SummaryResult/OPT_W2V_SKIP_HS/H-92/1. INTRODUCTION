To this end, we explore different approaches for ranking web search results using real user behavior obtained as part of normal interactions with the web search engine.
Our paper explores whether implicit feedback can be helpful in realistic environments, where user feedback can be noisy (or adversarial) and a web search engine already uses hundreds of features and is heavily tuned.
â€¢ An application of a robust implicit feedback model derived from mining millions of user interactions with a major web search engine (Section 4).
While it is intuitive that user interactions with the web search engine should reveal at
