Hence, we will also use RankNet as a generic ranker to explore the contribution of implicit feedback for different ranking alternatives. 
The main reason for ignoring the original scores is that since the feature spaces and learning algorithms are different, the scores are not directly comparable, and re-normalization tends to remove the benefit of incorporating classifier scores.
We now relax this assumption by integrating implicit feedback features directly into the ranking process.
3.1 Implicit Feedback as Independent Evidence The general approach is to re-rank the results obtained by a web search engine according to observed clickthrough and other user interactions
