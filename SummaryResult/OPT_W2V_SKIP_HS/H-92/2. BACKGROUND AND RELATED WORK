Other studies of user behavior in web search include Pharo and JÃ¤rvelin [19], but were not directly applied to improve ranking.
Closely related to our work, Joachims [11] collected implicit measures in place of explicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.
Implicit relevance measures have been studied by several research groups.
At the same time, while recent work (e.g., [26]) on using clickthrough information for improving web search ranking is promising, it captures only one aspect of the user interactions with web search engines.
We build on existing research to develop robust user
