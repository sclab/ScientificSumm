When implicit feedback is available, the BM25F+All system returns relevant document at top 1 almost 70% of the time, compared 53% of the time when implicit feedback is not considered by the original BM25F system.
We first present the results over all 1000 test queries (i.e., including queries for which there are no implicit measures so we use the original web rankings).
We compare alternative methods of exploiting implicit feedback , both by re-ranking the top results ( i.e. , the BM25F-RerankCT and BM25F-RerankAll methods that reorder BM25F results ) , as well as by integrating the implicit features directly
