We propose a cluster-based method for  selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback.
With term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without  interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query expansion process.
In this paper we study term-based feedback for information  retrieval in the language modeling approach.
Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback.
