Second, how to compute an updated query model based on this term feedback evidence, so that it captures the user"s information need and translates into good retrieval performance. 
We adopt this view, and cast our task as updating the query model from user term feedback.
With this model, the retrieval task involves estimating a query language model θq from a given query, a document language model θd from each document, and calculating their KL-divergence D(θq||θd), which is then used to score the documents.
[ 25 ] treats relevance feedback as a query model re-estimation problem , i.e.
