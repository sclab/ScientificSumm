Although techniques for adjusting query term weights exist for vector space models[17] and probablistic relevance models[9], most of the aforementioned works do not use them, choosing to just append feedback terms to the original query (thus using equal weights for them), which can lead to poorer retrieval performance.
The user is found to be not good at identifying useful terms for query expansion, when a simple term presentation interface is unable to provide sufficient semantic  context of the feedback terms.
In a simulated study carried out in [ 18 ] , the author compares the retrieval performance of
