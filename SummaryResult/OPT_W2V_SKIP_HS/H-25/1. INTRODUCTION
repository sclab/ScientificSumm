We can consider a more direct way to involve a user in query model improvement, without an intermediary step of document feedback that can introduce noise.
During our participation in the TREC 2005 HARD Track and continued study afterward, we explored how to exploit term  feedback from the user to construct improved query models for  information retrieval in the language modeling approach.
Finally, by comparing term feedback with document-level feedback, we found it to be a viable alternative to the latter with competitive retrieval performance.
Section 4 outlines our general approach to term feedback.
