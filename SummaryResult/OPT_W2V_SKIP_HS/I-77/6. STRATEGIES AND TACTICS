It is reasonable to  expect β to progress towards her target at the same rate and Nα(Ψt ) is calculated by replacing β by α in Equation 6.
If the set of options is empty then α will quit the negotiation.
Following from Equation 5 , α will want to achieve a negotiation target , Nβ ( Ψt ) such that : ν · Nβ ( Ψt ) + ( 1 − ν ) · V ∗t β is a bit on the T∗t β side of V ∗t β : Nβ ( Ψt ) = ν − κ ν
