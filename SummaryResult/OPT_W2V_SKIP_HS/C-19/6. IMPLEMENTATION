All these features made it easy to implement dynamic replacement of network protocols.
A Service object t is compatible with another Service object s if the type of the arguments of requests (and responses) of t is a subtype of the arguments of requests (and responses) of s. In practice, if a protocol module Pi can issue a request to a protocol UDP, then it may also issue a request to TCP (compatible with UDP) due to the subtyping relation on parameters of communicating modules.
Finally , we present an example protocol stack that we have implemented to validate the
