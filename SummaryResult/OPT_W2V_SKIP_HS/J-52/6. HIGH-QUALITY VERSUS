LOW-QUALITY FORWARDING So far, we have considered the agents" strategy space to be  limited to the drop (a = 0) and forward (a = 1) actions.
Therefore, it may be possible for the principal to  maximize its utility by contracting with only m of the n nodes along the path.
Under the optimal contract, sB i = (1−k+q)i c(k−1) q < 0 Therefore, under any other contract the sender will have to  compensate each node with an expected payment that is higher than its expected transit cost.
124 There is an additional difference between the two models.
