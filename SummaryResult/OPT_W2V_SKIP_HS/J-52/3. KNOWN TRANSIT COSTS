Because the expected benefit when all nodes forward is the same under both scenarios, we only need to show that the expected total payment is identical as well.
Under the optimal contract that induces high-effort behavior from all intermediate nodes in the Nash  Equi118 librium2 , the expected payment to each node is the same as its  expected cost, with the following payment schedule: sB i = si(x = xB ) = 0 (2) sG i = si(x = xG ) = c (1 − k)n−i+1 (3) PROOF.
Given two paths with respective lengths of n1 and n2 hops , per-hop transit costs of c1 and
