From 1 and 2, we get that if a node i can increase its expected utility by deviating from bi under M , it can also increase its utility by deviating from bi in M, but this is in contradiction to bi being an equilibrium in M. 4.
In addition to the generalization of FPSS into FPSS , we can also consider the generalization of the first-price auction (FPA) mechanism, where the principal determines the LCP and pays each node on the LCP its bid, pi(b) = bi.
We will show that FPSS induces an equilibrium in which all nodes truthfully reveal
