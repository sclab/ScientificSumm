We claim that an optimal strategy to commit to gives the leader an expected utility of at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | if and only if there is a solution to the INDEPENDENT-SET instance.
Then, this strategy must induce the follower to play t0 whenever it has a type of the form θe (because otherwise, the utility could be at most |E|−1 |E|+1 + |V | (|E|+1)|V | = |E| |E|+1 < |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | ).
However , if the leader has only a single type , then the problem becomes easy again ( # types is the number of types for
