Recently methods of â€˜learning to rank" have been applied to ranking model construction and some promising results have been obtained.
[19] also propose a method of directly maximizing rank-based metrics for ranking on the basis of manifold learning.
[3] employ Relative Entropy as a loss function and Gradient Descent as an algorithm to train a Neural Network model for ranking in document retrieval.
For other  approaches to learning to rank, refer to [2, 11, 31].
It is a common practice in IR to tune the parameters of a ranking model using some labeled data and one performance measure [
