The objective of learning is to create a ranking function f : X â†’ , such that for each query the elements in its corresponding  document list can be assigned relevance scores using the function and then be ranked according to the scores.
At each round, it increases the weights of those queries that are not ranked well by ft, the model created so far.
For example, a weak ranker can be created by using a subset of queries (together with their document list and label list) sampled according to the distribution Pt.
Ideally we want to maximize the ranking accuracy in
