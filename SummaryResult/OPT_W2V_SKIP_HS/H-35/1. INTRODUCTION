[8] take a similar approach and perform the learning by using boosting,  referred to as RankBoost.
Several methods for learning to rank have been developed and applied to document retrieval.
All the existing methods used for  document retrieval [2, 3, 8, 13, 16, 20] are designed to optimize loss functions loosely related to the IR performance measures, not loss functions directly based on the measures.
In training, a ranking model is constructed with data  consisting of queries, their corresponding retrieved documents, and  relevance levels given by humans.
As the number of features in the ranking model gets larger and the
