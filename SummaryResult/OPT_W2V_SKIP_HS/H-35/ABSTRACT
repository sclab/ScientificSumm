Ideally a learning  algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data.
Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by  minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures.
We prove that the training process of AdaRank is exactly that of enhancing the  performance measure used.
To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures.
In the task , a model is automatically created with some training data
