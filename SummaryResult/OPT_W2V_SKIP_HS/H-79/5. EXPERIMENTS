In Figure 1 we show the performance of fRank trained with only the popularity feature set vs. the amount of data we have for the popularity feature set.
For example, the fourth line of the table shows that fRank using the page, popularity, and anchor features outperformed any network that used the page, popularity, and some other feature set, and that the performance of this network was 67.25%.
Shown is the decrease in accuracy when we train a network that has all but the given set of features.
Further experiments found that , of the page features , those based
