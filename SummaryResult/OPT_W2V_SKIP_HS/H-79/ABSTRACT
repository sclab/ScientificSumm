We gain a further boost in accuracy by using data on the frequency at which users visit Web pages.
We use RankNet, a ranking machine learning algorithm, to combine these and other static features based on anchor text and domain characteristics.
We show that we can significantly outperform PageRank using features that are independent of the link structure of the Web.
Since the publication of Brin and Page"s paper on PageRank, many in the Web community have depended on PageRank for the static (query-independent) ordering of Web pages.
