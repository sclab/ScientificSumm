In the case where the set of servers predicted having free resources available is not empty (line 13), the agent selects one of those for allocation.
This is the standard case at the beginning of the agent life-cycle as there is no information about the environment available.
In the case, no free resources are expected (line 9), the agent will explore resources by  allocating the task at a randomly selected server from all not predictable servers to gather resource load information.
Therefore , each agent keeps track of the performance of a private collection of its predictors and selects the
