Another mainly unsolved problem of those approaches is the fine-tuning of price and time, budget constraints to enable efficient resource allocation in large, dynamic systems [22].
In this paper we propose a distributed solution of the  resource allocation problem based on self-organisation of the resource consumers in a system with limited resources.
All control needed for our algorithm is distributed among the agents in the system.
This can be achieved by the mutual interactions between agents by applying techniques from complex system theory.
Selforganisation of all agents leads to a self-organisation of the 74 978-81-904262-7-5 ( RPS ) c 2007
