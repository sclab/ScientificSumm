An adaptive, multi-agent approach is an ideal fit to this naturally distributed problem where the complex interaction among the aircraft, airports and traffic controllers renders a pre-determined centralized solution severely suboptimal at the first deviation from the expected plan.
Finally, in Section 5, we discuss the  implications of these results and provide and map the required work to enable the FAA to reach its stated goal of increasing the traffic volume by threefold. 
In this approach, the agents" actions are to set the separation that approaching aircraft are required to keep.
Unlike many other flow problems where the increasing
