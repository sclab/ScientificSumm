Finding reliable and adaptive solutions to the flow management problem is of paramount importance if the Next Generation Air Transportation  Systems are to achieve the stated goal of accommodating three times the current traffic volume.
In this paper we use FACET - an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry - to test a multi-agent algorithm for traffic flow management.
Agents use reinforcement learning to set this separation and their actions speed up or slow down traffic to manage congestion.
Our FACET based results show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up
