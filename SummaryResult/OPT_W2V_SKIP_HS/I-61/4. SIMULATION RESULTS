This experiment also shows that estimating the difference reward is not only possible, but also quite effective, when the true value of the difference reward cannot be computed.
Figure 9 shows the results which lead to three interesting observations: â€¢ First, there is a zero congestion penalty solution.
The methods are then tested on a more difficult problem, where a second point of congestion is added with the 100 remaining aircraft going through this second point of congestion.
The computation cost of the system evaluation , G ( Equation 1 ) is almost entirely dependent on the computation of
