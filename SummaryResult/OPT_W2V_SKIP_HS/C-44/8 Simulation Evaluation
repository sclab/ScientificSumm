Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we compare sequence-based MSP with basic MSP under different number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.
Clearly the mean error in  basic MSP is not affected by the number of target nodes, as shown in Figure 15(c).
The results shown in Figure 14(b) indicate that (i) as the number of anchor nodes increases, the localization error decreases, and (ii)  statistically, regular scan obtains better results than random scan with identical number of anchors.
In general , the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly
