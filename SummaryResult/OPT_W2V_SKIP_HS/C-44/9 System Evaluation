Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.
We note that with a 0.35 feet protection band, the percentage of unlocalized nodes is very small, e.g., in the worst-case with 11 anchors, only 2 out of 46 nodes are not localized due to flipping.
Figure 19 shows that a long tilted line is generated by the projectors.
9.2 Outdoor System Evaluation The outdoor system evaluation contains two parts : ( i ) effective detection distance evaluation , which shows that the node sequence can be readily obtained , and
