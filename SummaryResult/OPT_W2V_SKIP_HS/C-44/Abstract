To overcome limitations in  existing solutions, we present a Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments.
Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and  effective range of sensor devices.
We have evaluated the MSP system through theoretical analysis, extensive simulation as well as two physical systems (an indoor version with 46 MICAz motes and an outdoor version with 20 MICAz motes).
This evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot , requiring neither additional costly
