To extend this process, suppose we have M anchor nodes and perform d scans from different angles, obtaining d node  sequences and dividing the area into many small parts.
Basic MSP only makes use of the order information  between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence.
Since the locations of the anchor nodes are available, the anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area vertically and horizontally into 16 parts, as shown in Figure 2.
