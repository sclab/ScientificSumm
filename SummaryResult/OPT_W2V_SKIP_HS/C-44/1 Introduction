To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in  deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors.
Realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the large-scale outdoor environment, researchers have recently proposed solutions (e.g., Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18]) for sensor node localization using the spatiotemporal  correlation of controlled events (i.e., inferring nodes" locations based on the detection time of controlled events).
â€¢ To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of
