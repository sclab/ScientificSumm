Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave  propagation scenario.
The only thing the  system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval  between two successive localization events.
Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event.
In Figure 11 , if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line , which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of
