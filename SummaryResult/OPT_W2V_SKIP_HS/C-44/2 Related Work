Although the received signal strength  indicator (RSSI) related [2, 24] methods were once considered an ideal low-cost solution, the irregularity of radio  propagation [26] seriously limits the accuracy of such systems.
StarDust [21], which works much faster, uses label relaxation algorithms to match light spots  reflected by corner-cube retro-reflectors (CCR) with sensor nodes using various constraints.
In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be  precise in both time and space.
The main idea is to correlate the event detection time at a sensor node with the known space-time relationship of controlled events at the generator so that detection time-stamps
