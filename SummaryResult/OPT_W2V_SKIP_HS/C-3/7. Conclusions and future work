Another line of research that we wish to investigate is using feedback control to refine the adaptation strategy during the application run.
The performance monitoring allows us to learn certain application requirements such as the number of processors needed by the application or the application"s bandwidth  requirements.
We start the application on an arbitrary set of resources and monitor its performance.
Our simple adaptation strategy allows us to handle multiple scenarios typical for grid environments : expand to more nodes or shrink to fewer nodes if the application was started on an inappropriate number of processors , remove
