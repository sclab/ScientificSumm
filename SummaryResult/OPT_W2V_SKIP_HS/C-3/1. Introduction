In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an alternative approach to application adaptation and resource selection which does not need a performance model.
It handles all of the following cases : • automatically adapting the number of processors to the degree of parallelism in the application , even when this degree changes dynamically during the computation • migrating ( part of ) a computation away from overloaded resources • removing resources with poor communication links that slow down the computation • adding new resources to replace resources that have crashed Our work assumes the application is malleable and can run
