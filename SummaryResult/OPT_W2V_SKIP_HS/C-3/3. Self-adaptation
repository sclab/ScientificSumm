This simple adaptation strategy allows us to improve application performance in several situations typical for the Grid: • If an application is started on fewer processors than its degree of parallelism allows, it will automatically expand to more  processors (as soon as there are extra resources available).
Adaptation strategy • If the application degree of parallelism is changing during the computation, the number of nodes the application is running on will be automatically adjusted.
In the heterogeneous world , it is hardly beneficial to add processors if the efficiency is lower than 50 % unless the added processor is faster
