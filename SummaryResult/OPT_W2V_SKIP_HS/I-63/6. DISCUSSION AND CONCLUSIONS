While there are many domains where this  assumption is valid, in many cases agents arrive and  depart dynamically and their arrival and departure times can only be predicted probabilistically, leading to online resource-allocation problems.
Relaxing the assumption about deterministic arrival and departure times of the agents is a focus of our future work.
It is easy to extend the model so that the agents incur an explicit penalty for idling by assigning a non-zero negative reward to the start state sb .
This is a consequence of our MDP-augmentation procedure from Section 4.1.
Finally , we have assumed that agents ''
