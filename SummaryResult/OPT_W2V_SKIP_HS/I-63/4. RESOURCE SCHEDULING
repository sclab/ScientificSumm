Using this LP as a basis, we augment it with constraints that ensure that the resource usage implied by the agents" occupation measures {xm} does not violate the global  resource requirements bϕ at any time step τ ∈ [0, bτ].
To summarize, Table 1 together with the  conservationof-flow constraints from (12) defines the MILP that  simultaneously computes an optimal resource assignment for all agents across time as well as optimal finite-horizon MDP policies that are valid under that resource assignment.
This constraint is not used for the dynamic problem formulation , where resources can be reallocated between agents at
