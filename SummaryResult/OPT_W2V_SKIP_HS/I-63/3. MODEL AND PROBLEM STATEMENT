Notice that an agent is not allowed to stop and restart its MDP, so agent m1 is only able to continue executing in the interval τ ∈ [3, 4] if it has actions that do not require any resources (ϕm(a, ω) = 0).
on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) (a) (b) Figure 1: Illustration of a solution to a resource-scheduling problem with three agents and three resources: a) static resource assignments (resource assignments are constant within agents" lifetimes; b) dynamic assignment (resource assignments are allowed to change at every time step). 
Given the above input , the
