At starting node related to the first concept, the similarity value is constant and equal to one.
In our system, whereas the list of services that can be  offered by the producer are each a feature vector, the most specific set S is not a feature vector.
This means that we have to consider the effect of n when measuring similarity.
Otherwise, we compute the common parent of the two nodes and the distance of each concept to the common parent without considering the sibling (lines 5-7).
We find the similarity by dividing the weighted sum of the similarities of
