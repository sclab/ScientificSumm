For instance, if the example continues with a negative sample (Full, Strong, Red), we can specialize the previous rule such as {(?-Full), ?, (?-Red)}.
As the name suggests, it is a  generalization and contains all possible values unless the values have been identified not to represent the concept.
from the general set while having a positive sample such as (Full, Strong, White).
Accordingly, the consumer generates a request where the color feature is set to red and other features are set to arbitrary values, e.g.
During the interactions , each request of the consumer can be considered as a positive example
