Equation (2) is the ad relevance model that we consider in this paper, with unknown parameters P(Cj|q) for each query q.
We assume that a person searches an ad a by constructing a query q: the person first picks a concept Cj according to the weights P(Cj|a), and then constructs a query q with probability P(q|Cj) based on the concept Cj.
Thus, we only need to obtain estimates of P(Cj|q) for each query q.
The search engine can then be represented by a function f = similarity ( q , d ) that quantifies the affinity
