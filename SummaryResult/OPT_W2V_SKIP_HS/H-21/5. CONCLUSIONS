When using search results, one can either use only summaries of the results provided by 3 Since the field of query classification does not yet have  established and agreed upon benchmarks, direct comparison of results is admittedly tricky.
For a classifier that is external to the search engine, retrieving full pages may be prohibitively costly, in which case one might prefer to use summaries to gain computational efficiency.
In this study we used two major search engines, A and B. Interestingly, we found notable distinctions in the quality of their output.
These results are consistent with prior studies [ 5
