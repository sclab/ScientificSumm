The main research questions of this approach the are (1) how to build a  document classifier, (2) how to translate its classifications into the target taxonomy, and (3) how to determine the query class based on document classifications.
In this approach, the problem of not having a document classifier for web results is solved by using a training set available for documents with a different  taxonomy.
Studies in the field pursue different approaches for  obtaining additional information about the queries.
More recently , studies in query augmentation focused on classification of queries , assuming such classifications to be beneficial for
