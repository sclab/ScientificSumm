The whole computation is made by a process, which uses a parallel controller to start and dispatch several concurrent activities of the same type, in order to find prime numbers.
It receives, through its input  parameters, a range of integers in which prime numbers have to be found, the number of primes to be returned, and the number of activities to be executed in order to perform this work.
The advantage of using controllers is the possibility of the support infrastructure determines the point of execution the process is in , allowing automatic recovery and monitoring , and also the
