Finally, it is  interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of  processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 
This support  infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive  distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of  process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.
In order to address such subject , this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure
