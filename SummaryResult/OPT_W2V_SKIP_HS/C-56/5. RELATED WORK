Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture  contains widely distributed process coordinators, which  coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.
The grid architectures generally have services that  manage computing resources and distribute the execution of  independent tasks on available ones.
There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide  interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous  networks.
