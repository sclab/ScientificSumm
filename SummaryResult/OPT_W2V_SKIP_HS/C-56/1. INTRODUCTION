Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed  processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and  steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.
However, such infrastructures contain  scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13].
Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities.
The programming model and the support infrastructure , named X avantes , are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the
