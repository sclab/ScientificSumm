The algorithm forms Ω as a set that is  conflict-freethis means that prohibitions are annotated with a conflict set that indicates which bindings for variables have to be avoided.
In order to provide an Ω that reflects all these conflicts for a specific prohibition, we have to form ΣMAX c containing all conflict sets σc for a given  prohibition ω.
We define below how we obtain the set of conflicting norms of a normative state Ω: DEF.
Our algorithm is correct in that it provides , for a given Ω , a new Ω in which i ) all ground
