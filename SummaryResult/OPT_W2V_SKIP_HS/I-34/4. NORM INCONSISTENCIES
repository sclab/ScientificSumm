The conflict resolution algorithm can be applied without change to accumulate a maximal conflict set ΣMAX c for each prohibition in Ω that unifies with obligations. 
The obligation demands that an agent performs an action that is forbidden.
We can reuse the machinery, introduced above for  resolving conflicts between permissions and prohibitions, in order to a) detect and b) resolve such inconsistencies.
Similarly, a situation of inconsistency can be defined reusing this definition and replacing the P deontic modality with O.
With Definition 7 , we 3 The combinatorial effort is not necessary anymore if instead we maintain a set
