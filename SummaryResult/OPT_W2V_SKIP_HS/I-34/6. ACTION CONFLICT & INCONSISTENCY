Rather than making use of sophisticated formalisms for ontology construction, we employ a set of domain axioms, defined below: DEF.
Relationships among actions are domain-dependent.
The domain axioms, denoted as Δ, are a finite and  possibly empty set of formulae ϕ → (ϕ1 ∧ · · · ∧ ϕn) where ϕ, ϕi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are atomic first-order formulae.
For instance , if p ( X ) amounts to q ( X , X ) , then norms PA : Rp ( X ) and FA : Rq ( X , X ) are in conflict since PA
