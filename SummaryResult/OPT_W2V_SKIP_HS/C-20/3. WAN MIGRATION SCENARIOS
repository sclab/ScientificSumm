Second, we deal with the more general case where the service also requires the  migration of data storage to the new data center.
To achieve this, we allow the storage to be replicated asynchronously, prior to any initiation of the maintenance event, or, assuming the amount of data to be transfered is relatively small, asynchronous replication can be started in anticipation of a migration that is  expected to happen shortly.
Note that while we have described the live server migration process as involving the service provider for the networking part , it is possible for a data center provider to
