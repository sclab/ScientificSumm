In this case, it is clear that the two offers o1 and o2 are  nonsupported.
The argumentation system AC , DefC of this agent will return a2 as an accepted argument, and a1 as a rejected one.
P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o1, 2 Note that in the above example, since there is no exchange of arguments, the theories of both agents do not change.
The following dialogue may take place between the two agents : P : m1 = P , θ , o1 , 0 C : m2
