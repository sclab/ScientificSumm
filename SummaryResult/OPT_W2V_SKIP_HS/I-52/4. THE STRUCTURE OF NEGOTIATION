The previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations  sanction extensions that support exactly one offer.
Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A.
Let A be a set of arguments, R the  attacking relation of A defined as R ⊆ A × A, and an acyclic relation on A.
Let A, F, R, , Def be a negotiating agent such that A = AO and is an acyclic relation.
