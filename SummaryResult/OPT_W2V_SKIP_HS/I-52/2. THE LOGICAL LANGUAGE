The idea behind this  assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose only one at a given step of the dialogue.
Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the  arguments of Argsb(L).
In what follows, the set Args(L) is then divided into two subsets: a subset Argso(L) of  arguments supporting offers, and a subset Argsb(L) of arguments supporting beliefs.
Indeed , an argument in favor of a decision , built both on an agent '' s beliefs and goals , tries to justify the choice ; whereas an argument
