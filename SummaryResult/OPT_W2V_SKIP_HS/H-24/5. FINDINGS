We then look at the effect on the browsing features of increasing the value of padvanced required to be considered advanced from 1% to 100%.
As we increase the value of padvanced as in previous sections, the average relevance score across all metrics also increases (all Pearson"s R â‰¥ .654), suggesting that more advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their searching.
We have also shown that the greater the proportion of queries that contain advanced syntax, the larger the differences in query and clickthrough behaviors become.
