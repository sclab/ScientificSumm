For future work, Apocrita will have a smart content distribution model in which a single instance of a file can intelligently and transparently replicate throughout the network to ensure a copy of every important file will always be available regardless of the availability of specific nodes in the network.
A proof of concept prototype has been constructed, but the results from measuring the network transport mechanism and the indexing time were not as impressive as initially envisioned.
Finally , the current implementation has some overhead and redundancy due to the fact that the entire index is maintained on each individual
