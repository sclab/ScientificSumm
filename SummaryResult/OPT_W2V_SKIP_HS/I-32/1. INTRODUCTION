In addition, we use the results presented in [9] to  discuss the importance of opponent modeling in our  ConnectFour adversarial domain.
However, none of this research dealt with adversarial domains and their implications for agent behavior.
We explore environment properties and the mental states of agents to derive  behavioral axioms; these behavioral axioms constitute a formal model that serves as a specification and design guideline for agent design in such settings.
In these latter environments especially , using a utility-based adversarial search ( such as the Min-Max algorithm ) does not always provide an adequate solution ; the payoff function
