The results we presented are a first step towards an  expanded model that will cover all types of adversarial  environments, for example, environments that are non-zero-sum, and environments that contain natural agents that are not part of the direct conflict.
The model is meant to be used as a guideline for  designing agents that need to operate in such adversarial  environments.
We presented an Adversarial Environment model for a 2 These were later removed from the final analysis.
We presented empirical results , based on ConnectFour log file analysis , that exemplify the model and the axioms for a bilateral
