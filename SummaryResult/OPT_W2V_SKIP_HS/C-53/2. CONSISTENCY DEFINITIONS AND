If De(i, j, t) > De(l, k, t), it can be stated that, at time point t, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. Similarly, De(i, j, t1, t2) can been used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency in a certain time period.
De(i, j, t) can be used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency at a certain time point.
If De ( i , j , t1 , t2 ) > De ( l ,
