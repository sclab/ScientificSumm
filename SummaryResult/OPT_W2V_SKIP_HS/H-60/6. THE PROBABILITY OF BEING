The setting 位 = ln N is special in the sense that the frequency-based and the Poisson-based informativeness have the same denominator, namely ln N, and the Poisson sum converges to 位.
The Poisson probabilities approximate the independence probabilities for large n(t); the approximation is better for larger 位.
INFORMATIVE We showed in the previous sections that the disjointness assumption leads to frequency-based probabilities and that the independence assumption leads to Poisson probabilities.
For the informativeness, we observe that the radical  behaviour of Poisson is preserved.
The noise figure shows the lifting for the value 位 : = ln N
