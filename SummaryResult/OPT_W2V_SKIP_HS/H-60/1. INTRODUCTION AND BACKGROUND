When investigating the probabilistic interpretation of the 227 normalised idf , we made several observations related to  disjointness and independence of document events.
Can we interpret Pfreq , the normalised idf , as the probability that the term is informative?
We show in section 3.1 that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N used in the classic idf -definition can be explained by three assumptions: binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document containment events.
With N being the total number of documents , and n ( t ) being the number of documents in which term t occurs , the
