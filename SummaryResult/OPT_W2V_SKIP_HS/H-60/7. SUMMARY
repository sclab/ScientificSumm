We discussed that the absence of those parameters is compensated by a leverage effect of the within-document term occurrence probability and the document containment probability.
The links between indepence-based noise as document frequency, probabilistic interpretation of idf , information theory and Poisson described in this paper may lead to variable  probabilistic idf and tf definitions and combinations as required in advanced and personalised information retrieval systems.
of documents in a collection, or the different nature of terms (coverage, importance,  position, etc.)
By applying an independence rather a disjointness assumption for the document containment , we could establish a link between the
