Master SlaveSlaveSlave Internet database segment but only part of it is processed in each node The database is replicated in the nodes, Figure 2: PackageBLAST segmentation and  distribution mechanism. 
GBTK is a master/slave application that receives the sequences and the name of the genetic database.
It distributes sequences among the grid nodes using two allocation policies: FCFS and minmax.
Grid Blast Toolkit (GBTK) [12] is a web portal to execute BLAST searches in Globus 3.
Having decided which sequences will be compared by each node , GridBlast sends the sequences , the executable files and the whole database to the
