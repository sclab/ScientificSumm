This led to the idea of grid computing, which involves  cooperative and secure sharing of non-dedicated and  heterogeneous resources that are geographically distributed [5].
As far as we know, this is the first grid service that runs BLAST with multiple task policies with a segmented database in a heterogeneous non-dedicated platform.
This paper is organized as follows.
Biological sequence comparison (or sequence alignment) is one of the most important problems in computational  biology, given the number and diversity of the sequences and the frequency on which it is needed to be solved daily.
The choice of the best allocation policy
