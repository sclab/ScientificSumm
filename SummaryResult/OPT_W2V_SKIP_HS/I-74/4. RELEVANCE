Proposition 3.1 tells us that to affect the status of an argument A , the node v representing the argument A that is effecting the change has to be connected to v , the node representing A , and so it follows that every new node added as a result of an  R1relevant move will be connected to the argumentation graph.
For example, to restate a case from the proof of Proposition 4.2, a move that is R3-relevant by definition has to add a node to the argument graph that is connected to the last node that was added.
This , as we
