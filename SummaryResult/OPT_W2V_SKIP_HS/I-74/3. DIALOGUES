In all such cases, a sequence of undercut relations relates the two arguments, and if they are both in an argumentation graph, this means that they are connected.
Thus a dialogue corresponds to an argumentation graph if and only if every argument made in the dialogue corresponds to a node in the graph, and every node in the graph  corresponds to an argument made in the dialogue.
If a dialogue D always picks its moves m from the set M identified by protocol P , then D is said to conform to P. Even if a dialogue conforms to a
