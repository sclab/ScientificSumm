Finally, we show that the relationship  between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is natural and reflects the initial intuition well.
In our approach, plausibility can be seen as a temporal property of behaviors.
In this paper, we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior: this notion is added to the language of CTLK [19], which is a  straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic CTL [4, 3] and standard epistemic logic [9, 5].
Our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that allows the study of strategies , time ,
