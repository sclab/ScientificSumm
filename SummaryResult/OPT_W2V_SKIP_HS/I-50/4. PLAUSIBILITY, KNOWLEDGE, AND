In that case we have Baϕ ∧ Ba¬ϕ for all formulae ϕ, because the set of states to be considered becomes empty.
Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all CTLKP models.
A CTLKP model is plausibly serial (or p-serial) for agent a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path  according to a, i.e.
Then Kaϕ → Baϕ is strongly valid, and in the class of p-serial models we have even that |≡ Kaϕ ↔ Baϕ.
It is easy to see that the axiom is not valid in general : as
