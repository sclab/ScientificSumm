We assume that relation R is serial and that all ∼a are equivalence relations.
A path λ in M refers to a possible behavior (or  computation) of system M, and can be represented as an infinite sequence of states that follow relation R, that is, a sequence q0q1q2... such that qiRqi+1 for every i = 0, 1, 2, ... We  denote the ith state in λ by λ[i].
a sequence q0q1 ... such that q = q0 and there are q0 , ... , qi such that q0 ... qi q0q1 ... ∈ ΛM.2 The semantics of CTLK is
