The semantics of CTL are given with respect to the satisfaction relation |=, which holds between pairs of the form K, s, (where K is a Kripke structure and s is a state in K), and formulae of the language.
We have two states , s and t , and two corresponding Boolean variables p1 and p2 , which are 1 In the branching time temporal logic literature , a relation R ⊆ S × S is said to be total iff ∀s ∃s : ( s , s ) ∈ R. Note that the term total relation is sometimes
