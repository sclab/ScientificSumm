We have proposed a logical framework to reason about such scenarios, and we have given some computational costs for settling some of the main  questions about them.
And, for a system designer, how to be sure that the system will behave socially, that is, according to its norm.
The question then, for an agent is, how to be sure that others will comply with a norm.
Game theory is a very natural tool to analyse and answer these questions , which involve strategic considerations , and we have proposed a way to translate key questions concerning logic-based normative systems to
