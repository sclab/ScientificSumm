, γn where K is a Kripke structure, and for each agent i in K, γi is a goal hierarchy over K. 4.1 The Utility of Normative Systems We can now define the utility of a Kripke structure for an agent.
A particular Kripke structure K is said to satisfy a goal at index x in goal hierarchy γ if K |= γ [ x ] , i.e. , if γ [ x ] is satisfied in all initial states S0 of K. An obvious potential property of goal hierarchies is monotonicity : where goals at higher levels in the hierarchy
