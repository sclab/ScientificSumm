Although the various approaches to normative systems proposed in the literature differ on technical details, they all share the same  basic intuition that a normative system is a set of constraints on the behaviour of agents in the system; by imposing these constraints, it is hoped that some desirable objective will emerge.
In this paper, we develop a model of normative systems in which agents are assumed to have multiple goals, of increasing priority.
Using this scheme , we define a model of ordinal utility , which in turn allows us to interpret our Kripkebased normative systems as games ,
