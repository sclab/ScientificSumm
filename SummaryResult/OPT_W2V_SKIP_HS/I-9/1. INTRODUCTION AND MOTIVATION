To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints.
This provides a natural manipulation and reasoning mechanism as well as internal enforcement mechanisms for commitments based on proof search.
Both  commitments and protocol actions can then be reasoned about in one consistent system.
In order to achieve that, we specify protocols in a declarative manner, i.e.
The agent paradigm has become well suited as a design metaphor to deal with complex systems comprising many components each having their own
