However, as we argue in this paper, few existing representation languages are both modular, compact and computationally grounded on the one hand, and allow for representing properties of both knowledge and strategic ability, on the other.
The semantics of logics like the ones presented in Section 2 are usually defined over explicit models (Kripke structures) that enumerate all possible (global) states of the system.
First, in Section 2, we present the background of our work - that is, logics that combine time, knowledge, and strategies.
The structure of the paper is as follows.
Lately , an increasing amount of research has
