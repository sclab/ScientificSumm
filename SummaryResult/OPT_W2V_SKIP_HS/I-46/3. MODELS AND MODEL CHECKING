A slightly different variant of  concurrent programs can be defined via synchronous product of programs, so that all agents play simultaneously.5 Unfortunately, under such interpretation, no direct interaction between agents" actions can be modeled at all.
It is easy to see that such a representation is modular and  compact as far as we are concerned with states.
On the other hand, they are in many ways difficult to use to describe an actual system: â€¢ Exponential size: temporal models usually have an  exponential number of states with respect to any higher-level  description (e.g.
And it is almost as difficult
