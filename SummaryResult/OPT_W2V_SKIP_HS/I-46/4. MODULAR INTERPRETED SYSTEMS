, ∼k for some arbitrary  accessibility relations ∼i over St. By Proposition 3, there exists a MIS S ˆM with global states Q such that ˆM = cegs(S ˆM , Q) is isomorphic to ˆM.
When  constructing a modular interpreted system S such that M = cegs(S, Q), we have that Sti must be isomorphic with St. 902 The Sixth Intl.
