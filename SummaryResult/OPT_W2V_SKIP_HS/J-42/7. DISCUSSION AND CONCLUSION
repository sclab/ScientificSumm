In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.
We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few  products, but reflects well the general tendency of  recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.
Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.
Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of â€˜converting '' every time they interact
