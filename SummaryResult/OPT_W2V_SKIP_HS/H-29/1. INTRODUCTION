For example, the document vectors may be combined with equal weighting, as in Rocchio, or by query likelihood, as may be done using the Relevance Model1 .
With this in mind, we wish to treat many important quantities calculated by the  retrieval system, whether a relevance score for a document, or a weight for a query expansion term, as random  variables whose true value is uncertain but where the  uncertainty about the true value may be quantified by replacing the fixed value with a probability distribution over possible values.
