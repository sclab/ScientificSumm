Second, sampling is an effective way to estimate basic properties of the feedback posterior distribution, which can then be used for improved model combination.
Like the document scoring function f(D, Q), the feedback algorithm may implement a complex, non-linear scoring formula, and so as its inputs vary, the resulting feedback models may have a complex distribution over the space of feedback models (the sample space).
The language model that would have been chosen by the baseline expansion is at the center of each map.
Although the Dirichlet is a unimodal distribution , and in general quite limited in its
