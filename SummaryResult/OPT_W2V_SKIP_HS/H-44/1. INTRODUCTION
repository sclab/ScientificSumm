Time-travel text search, as we develop it in this paper, is a crucial tool to explore these collections and to unfold their full potential as the following example demonstrates.

This paper presents an efficient solution to time-travel text search by making the following key contributions: 1.
Given a keyword query q and a time t our goal is to identify and rank relevant
