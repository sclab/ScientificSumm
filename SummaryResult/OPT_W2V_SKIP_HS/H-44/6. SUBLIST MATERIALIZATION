In detail, the technique, which we refer to as PG (Performance  Guarantee) in the remainder, finds a set M that has minimal required space, but guarantees for any elementary time  interval [ti, ti+1) (and thus for any query q t with t ∈ [ti, ti+1)) that performance is worse than optimal by at most a factor of γ ≥ 1.
6.1 Performance/Space-Optimal Approaches One strategy to eliminate the problem of skipped postings is to eagerly materialize sublists for all elementary time intervals , i.e. , to choose M = E. In doing so , for every query q t only
