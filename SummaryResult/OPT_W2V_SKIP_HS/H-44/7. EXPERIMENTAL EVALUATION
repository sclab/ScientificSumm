Note that EPC values are smaller on WIKI than on  UKGOV, since terms in the query workload employed for WIKI are relatively rarer in the corpus.
ii) For the PG method we see that for an acceptable performance degradation of only 10% (i.e., Î³ = 1.10) the required space drops by more than one order of magnitude in comparison to Popt on both datasets.
Index size continues to reduce on both datasets, as we increase the value of .
iii ) The SB approach achieves close-to-optimal performance on both datasets , if allowed to consume at most three times the optimal amount
