Results unequivocally show that our methods make it  possible to build an efficient time machine scalable to large versioned text collections.
In order to further improve the performance of time-travel queries, we  introduce two principled techniques to trade off index size for its performance.
As a consequence, there is no scalable and principled solution to search such a collection as of a  specified time t. In this work, we address this shortcoming and propose an efficient solution for time-travel text search by extending the inverted file index to make it ready for  temporal search.
