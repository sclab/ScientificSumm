the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.
This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].
The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.
A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the
