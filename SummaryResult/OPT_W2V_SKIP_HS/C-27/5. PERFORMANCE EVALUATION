Figures 26 and 27 show the localization error versus the event size at two different ranges: 46m and 170m.
Event Size for the Point Scan EDF 20 An interesting trade-off is between the localization accuracy (usually the most important factor), and the localization time (important in environments where stealthiness is paramount).
As shown in Figure 16, it can be observed that an event size of approximately 10-15cm (depending on the scanning speed) minimizes our Cost function.
The parameters that we varied during the performance evaluation of our system were : the type of scanning ( Point , Line and Area
