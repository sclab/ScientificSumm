At t = 4 the section where each node resides can be determined A more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the plane, hence the number of bits in the code will increase.
Returning to the example shown in Figure 5, if a sensor node is located in the section with code 0000, and due to the noise, at time t = 3, it thinks it detected an event, it will incorrectly conclude that its code is 1000, and it positions itself two squares below its correct position.
It is important to remark that the localization error is independent of the
