In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.
In a similar approach, MoteTrack [17] distributes the reference RSSI values to the beacon nodes.
The RADAR system [2] uses the RSSI to build a centralized repository of signal strengths at various positions with respect to a set of beacon nodes.
