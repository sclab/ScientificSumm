Figure 10. μSpotlight system implementation With this implementation of the Spotlight system, we were able to generate Point, Line and Area Scan events.
The first implementation, called μSpotlight, had a short range (10-20 meters), however its capability of generating the entire spectrum of EDFs made it very useful.
This allowed us to bypass the windowing system and more precisely estimate the time when an event is displayed by the projector, hence a higher accuracy of timestamps of events.
The Spotlight system uses the timestamp received from a sensor node j , to obtain the angular measures Altj and Azj for
