This system employs an asymmetric architecture, in which sensor nodes do not need any additional hardware, other than what they currently have.
While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.
All the sophisticated hardware and computation reside on a single Spotlight device.
Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 23 ] [
