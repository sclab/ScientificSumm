4.3 Theta threshold We have determined empirically a detection threshold θ per source type and the hard decision of the occurrences having a score less than θ is set to false; false occurrences returned by the system are not considered as retrieved and therefore, are not used for computing ATWV, precision and recall.
Note that retrieval performance has been  evaluated separately for each source type since the accuracy of the speech differs per source type as shown in Section 4.2.
We measure precision and recall by comparing the results obtained over the automatic transcripts ( only the results having true
