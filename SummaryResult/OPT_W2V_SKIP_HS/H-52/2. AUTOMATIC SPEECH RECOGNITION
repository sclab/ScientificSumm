As explained in [13], the three main steps for building a WCN from a word lattice are as follows: 1.
As stated in [18], although WCNs are more compact than word lattices, in general the 1-best path obtained from WCN has a better word accuracy than the 1-best path obtained from the corresponding word lattice.
Each vertex in a lattice is associated with a timestamp and each edge ( u , v ) is labeled with a word or phone hypothesis and its prior probability , which is the probability of the signal delimited by the timestamps of the vertices
