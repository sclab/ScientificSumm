, en}, which is the set of vectors in Rn with nonnegative coordinates that sum to 1.
x and the open line segment zx is assigned outcome a, y and the open line segment xy is assigned outcome b, and z and the open line segment yz is assigned outcome c. Clearly, δab = −δba = δbc = −δcb = δca = −δac = −1, W-MON (the nonnegative  twocycle property) holds.
It is easy to see that D is a convex subset of the set of all functions from Sn to R. The outcome graph Gf is an infinite graph whose vertex set is the outcome set
