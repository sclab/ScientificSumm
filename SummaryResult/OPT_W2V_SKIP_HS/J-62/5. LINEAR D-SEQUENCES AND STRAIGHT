Clearly we can apply the above conclusion to v ∈ Db, w ∈ Dc and get a compatible pair (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCv w bc with −→a simple and δ(−→a ) ≤ v (b) − v (c).
PATHS For v, w ∈ D we write vw for the (closed) line segment joining v and w. A D-sequence −→u of order k is linear provided that there is a sequence of real numbers 0 = λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ .
