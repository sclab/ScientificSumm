For v, w ∈ D and b, c ∈ A, we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) such that −→a ∈ Pbc and −→u ∈ Svw .
A compatible pair is a pair (−→a , −→u ) where −→a is a path and −→u is a D-sequence satisfying ord(−→u ) = |−→a | and for each i ∈ [k], both ui−1 and ui belong to Dai .
We write C(−→a ) for the set of D-sequences −→u that are compatible with −→a .
A D-sequence of order k is a sequence −→u = (u0, .
For v , w ∈ D we write
