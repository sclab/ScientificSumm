Now we are ready for the zero three-cycle property: Lemma 17. ρab + ρbc + ρca = 0 for all a, b, c ∈ A.
Now suppose w is between u and v. By the above  argument, we have ρac + ρcb + ρba = 0 and by lemma 15, ρab + ρbc + ρca = −ρba − ρcb − ρac = 0.
Lemma 15. ρbc + ρcb = 0 for all b, c ∈ A.
First, we prove for the case where v is between u and w. From lemma 8, there are compatible pairs (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCuv ab , (−→a , −→u ) ∈ LCvw bc .
Lemma 14. ρbc ≤ δbc for
