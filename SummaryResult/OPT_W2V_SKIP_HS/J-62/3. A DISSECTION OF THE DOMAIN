Therefore S a∈A Da = D. Also, by proposition 5, any point v in Da ∩ Db satisfies v(a) − v(b) = δab = −δba. 
v ∈ Ra implies v(a) − v(b) ≥ δab and v ∈ Rb implies v(b)−v(a) ≥ δba which, by the nonnegative two-cycle property, implies v(a) − v(b) ≤ δab.
Thus v(a) − v(b) = δab and by symmetry v(b) − v(a) = δba.
In this section , we construct a family of closed convex sets { Da : a ∈ A } with disjoint interiors whose union
