It is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set D of real  matrices is a WM-domain.
Turning to parametric representations, let us say a set D of P × A matrices is an AM-domain if any truthful  social choice function with domain D is an affine maximizer.
What are the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is an AM-domain?
Let us say that a set D of P × A real valuation matrices is a WM-domain if any social choice function on D  satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful.
