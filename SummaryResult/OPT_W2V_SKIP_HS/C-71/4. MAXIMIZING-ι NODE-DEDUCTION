When a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage quality if its sensing area, except what overlaps the network margin, cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are grouped into the same group as itself, the algorithm stops.
It  calculates the resulting group sensing neighbors of it based on the above procedure.
Under the constraint that the coverage quality of its sensing area should be ensured, node i deletes nodes in this sub-network one by one.
The above procedure is handed over as what MIND does and new groups are thus formed
