We assume that the communication range of a sensor node is larger than 2 Â· R, which is also a general assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.
We assume that a sensor node can only be responsible to monitor a circular area centered at the node with a radius equal to R. This is a usual assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.
Based on this notion , to be more reasonable , researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements : Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes : For
