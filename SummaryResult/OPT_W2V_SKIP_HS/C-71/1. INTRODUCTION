This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to  select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the  surveillance work of the network area.
We show that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the  network.
We also introduce another greedy solution called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) for this problem, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate MIND.
It is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be working in sleeping mode ( i.e. , major power-consuming units such as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be
