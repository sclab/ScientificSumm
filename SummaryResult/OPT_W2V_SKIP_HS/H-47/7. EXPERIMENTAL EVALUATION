We also examined counting only the pairs judged with 1 as positive examples and did not find a significant change in the relative performance of the tested methods.
Therefore we could not use standard pooling as an evaluation method since we did not control the way the pairs were selected and could not precisely establish the set of ads from which the placed ads were selected.
We then used these judgments to evaluate how well our methods distinguish the positive and the negative ad assignments for each page.
Each different method was applied to this set and the ads were
