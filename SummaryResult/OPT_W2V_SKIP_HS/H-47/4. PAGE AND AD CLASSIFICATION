However, we obtained the best performance by using the third document classifier, based on the information in the source taxonomy queries only.
Given the taxonomy of queries (or bid-phrases - we use these terms interchangeably) described in the previous  section, we tried three methods to build corresponding page and ad classifiers.
It is an area of current investigation how to improve the classification using a noisy training set.
Figure 1 provides some statistics about the taxonomy used in this work.
As the score of the max class is normalized with regard to document length , the scores for different documents are
