Given that zi is true and ni = ¯xi (without loss of generality), it follows from the construction of SC that the setting of the yis causes SC to pay off iff it satisfies C. This establishes the reduction from T∃∀BF to the matching problem, when the securities are constrained to be a conjunction of polynomially many base events or their negations.
5.4.4 Reducing to clauses of at most 2 variables If we allow securities to have variable payoffs and prices , we can reduce to the case where each security '' s payoff clause is a conjunction of at most
