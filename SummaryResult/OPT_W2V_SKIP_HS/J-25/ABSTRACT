The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents" and  auctioneer"s optimization problems.
We develop and motivate the concept of a compound  securities market, presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples.
A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk  exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum.
We then analyze in  detail the auctioneer"s matching problem.
We show that , with n events ,
