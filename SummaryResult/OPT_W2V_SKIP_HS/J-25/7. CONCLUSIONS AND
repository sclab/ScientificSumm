A natural question is to determine whether a market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances this may occur.
We may consider a market to be in computational  equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find a strategy that increases utility.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have analyzed the computational complexity of  matching for securities based on logical formulas.
• How do make the above choices in a game  theoretically sound way, taking into account the choices of other traders, their reasoning about other traders, etc.
