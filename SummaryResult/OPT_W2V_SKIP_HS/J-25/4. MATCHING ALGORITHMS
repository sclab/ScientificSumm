For example, in some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction techniques, without writing down the full payoff vectors.
The straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible matching problem is linear programming; we set up an  appropriate linear program in Section 5.1.
There is some hope that specialized algorithms that  exploit structure among bids can perform better in terms of average-case time and space complexity.
Formalizing a logical-reduction algorithm for matching, or other algorithms that can exploit special  structure among the bids, is a promising avenue for future work. 
With n events , to set up the appropriate linear or
