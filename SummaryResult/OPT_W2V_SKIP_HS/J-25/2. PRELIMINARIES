Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments  cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore  conditions under which a smaller securities market may be  operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto  optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.
If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].
