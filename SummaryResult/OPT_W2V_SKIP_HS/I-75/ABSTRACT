As this assumption cannot be made in most situations though, we then set up an experimental framework aiming at  comparing the relative efficiency and effectiveness of different interaction protocols for hypotheses exchange.
We investigate the properties of a multiagent system where each (distributed) agent locally perceives its environment.
However, we further assume that communication opportunities are severely constrained and change dynamically.
We first show that ( for a wide class of protocols that we shall define ) , the communication constraints induced by the topology will not prevent the convergence of the system , at the condition that the
