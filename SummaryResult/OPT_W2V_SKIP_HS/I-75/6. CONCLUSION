There are many possible extensions to this work, the first being to further investigate the  properties of different global protocols belonging to the class we identified, and their influence on the outcome.
There are in particular many heuristics, highly dependent on the context of the study, that could intuitively yield interesting results (in our study, selecting the recipient on the basis of what can be inferred from his observed actions could be such a  heuristic).
In  particular we have exhibited conditions allowing convergence, and experimentally investigated a typical situation where those conditions cannot hold.
