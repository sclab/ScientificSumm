Since the number of documents that are discovered and downloaded from a textual database depends on the selection of the words that will be issued as queries5 to the search interface of each site, we compare the various selection policies that were described in section 3, namely the random, generic-frequency, and adaptive algorithms.
In order to further investigate how the quality of the potential query-term list affects the random-based algorithm , we construct two sets : one with the 16 , 000 most frequent words of the term collection used in the generic-frequency policy ( hereafter , the random policy
