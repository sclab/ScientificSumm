(1) the number of new  documents that can be obtained from the query qi and (2) the cost of issuing the query qi.
Now assume that we submit query qi to the Web site, but due to a limitation in the number of results that we get back, we retrieve the set qi (small circle in Figure 8) instead of the set qi (dashed circle in Figure 8).
We note that the query statistics table needs to be updated  whenever we issue a new query qi and download more documents.
Intuitively , the efficiency of qi measures how many new
