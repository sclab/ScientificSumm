While generating queries for multi-attribute databases is clearly a more difficult problem, we may exploit the following observation to  address this problem: When a site supports multi-attribute queries, the site often returns pages that contain values for each of the query attributes.
We proposed three different query generation policies for the Hidden Web : a policy that picks queries at random from a list of keywords , a policy that picks queries based on their frequency in a generic text collection , and a policy which adaptively picks a good query based on the content of the pages downloaded from
