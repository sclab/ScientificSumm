2.3 Problem formalization Theoretically, the problem of query selection can be formalized as follows: We assume that the crawler downloads pages from a Web site that has a set of pages S (the rectangle in Figure 5).
For simplicity, we assume that the Hidden-Web crawler issues single-term queries only.3 The crawler first decides which query term it is going to use (Step (2)), issues the query, and  retrieves the result index page (Step (3)).

Our algorithm leverages the observation that although
