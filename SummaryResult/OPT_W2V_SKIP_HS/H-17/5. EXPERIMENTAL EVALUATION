Based on this figure, we can see that our document pruning algorithm performs well across the scale of index sizes s: for all index sizes larger than 40%, we can guarantee the correct answer for about 70% of the queries.
The results of Figure 11, are very encouraging: we can answer a significant fraction of the queries with a small fraction of the  original index.
Therefore, in our next experiment we will measure the fraction of the results coming from an p-index that are contained within the results of the full index.
From the figure , we can see that
