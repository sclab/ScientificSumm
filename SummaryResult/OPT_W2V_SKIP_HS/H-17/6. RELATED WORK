The works in [1, 5, 7, 20, 27] are the most related to ours, as they describe pruning techniques based on the idea of keeping the  postings that contribute the most in the final ranking.
Similarly, there are a number of works that measure the quality of the documents,  typically as captured through link-based analysis [17, 28, 26].
Query-dependent relevance can be calculated in a variety of ways (see [3, 30]).
This thread of work is also orthogonal to ours because a caching scheme may operate on top of our p-index in order to minimize the answer  computation cost.
