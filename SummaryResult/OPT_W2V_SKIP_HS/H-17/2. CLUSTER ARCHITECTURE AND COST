Now, the real challenge is to find out (1) how we can compute the correctness indicator function C and (2) how we should prune the index to make sure that the majority of queries are handled by IP alone.
However , the two-tier architecture may have a significant drawback in terms of its result quality compared to the full replication of IF ; given the fact that the p-index contains only a subset of the data of the full index , it is possible that , for some queries , the p-index may not contain the top-ranked document according to
