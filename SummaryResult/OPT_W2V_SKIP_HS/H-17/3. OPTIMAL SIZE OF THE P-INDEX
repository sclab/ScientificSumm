We use s to denote the size of the p-index relative to IF (i.e., if s = 0.2, for example, the p-index is 20% of the size of IF ).
2 The above example shows that the cost of the two-tier  architecture depends on two important parameters: the size of the p-index and the fraction of the queries that can be handled by the 1st tier index alone.
We can do similar analysis when we use IP 2 and see that a total of 14 machines are needed when IP 2 is used.
Also suppose that if IF is pruned by 50
