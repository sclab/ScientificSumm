This suggests the algorithm in Figure 10 that computes the top-k result A from IP together with the correctness indicator function C. In the algorithm, the correctness indicator function C is set to one only if all documents in the top-k result A appear in all inverted lists I(ti) with ti ∈ q, so we know their exact score.
2 Proof Assume we create IP based on the GPR policy  (generalizing the proof to LPR is straightforward) and that every  document D with pr(D) > τp is included in IP .
Since the exact form of tr ( D ,
