In the same mixing interval, it also receives the best NMax audio packets (out of possibly M2) from CS 2, similarly the best NMax (out of possibly MP) from CS P. For simplicity, we ignore propagation delay between CSs which indeed can be taken into account; it is beyond the scope of this presentation.
This change implies that at most three intermediate entities exist for each audio packet, instead of two in the conventional setup.
Note that even if the SIP specification enables direct UA-to-UA media communication in a one-to-one call , it is also possible to use the Conference
