We believe this new generation of virtual conferencing environments will gain more popularity in the future as their ease of deployment is assured thanks to readily available technologies and scalable frameworks. 
Interactivity is achieved by adapting a recent stream selection scheme based on Loudness Number.
The traffic in the WAN (Internet) is upper-bounded by the square of the number of domains, -- further reduced by using heuristic algorithms -- which is far below the total number of clients in the conference.
We have argued that the distributed nature of deployment here makes it scalable.
