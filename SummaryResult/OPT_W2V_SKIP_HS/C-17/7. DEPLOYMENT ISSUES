Contour Plot of Capacity versus Optimum number of domains for various conference sizes 7.2 Conferencing with Two Levels of CSs Now considering the case where the number of clients in a particular domain is too large, i.e., d M Mi ≥ (9) one has to avoid the denial of service for new clients due to overloading of Conference Server.
We can then calculate the maximum theoretical number of active clients CUMi ⋅= in each domain as well as M, for the whole conference as CUdM ⋅⋅= .
We can specify no more than an upper bound on the number of clients
