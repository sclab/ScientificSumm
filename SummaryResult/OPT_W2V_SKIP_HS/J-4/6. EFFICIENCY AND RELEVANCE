We would expect efficiency to be maximized at q = 1, since in this case a bidder"s weight is exactly his relevance.
Proposition 2 confirms that efficiency is indeed maximized at q = 1.
After the swap, total relevance will have changed by the amount esxk−1 + etxk − etxk−1 − esxk = (es − et)(xk−1 − xk) > 0 As relevance strictly increases with each swap in the sort, total relevance is strictly greater when using q + rather than q.
Perform an exchange sort to obtain the ranking that arises with q + starting from the ranking that arises with q
