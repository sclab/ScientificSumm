There are K positions to be allocated among N bidders, where N > K. We assume that the (expected) click-through rate of bidder s in position t is of the form esxt, i.e.
A weight ws is associated with agent s, and agents bid for position.
Bidders have  quasilinear utility, so that the utility to bidder s of obtaining position t at a price of p per click is esxt(vs âˆ’ p).
If agent s bids bs, his corresponding score is wsbs.
> xK > 0 and let xt = 0 for t > K. We also refer to es
