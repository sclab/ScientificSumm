We used a Gaussian copula to create dependence between value and relevance.7 Given the marginal distributions for value and relevance together with this copula, we simulated the revenue effect of varying q for different levels of  Spearman correlation, with 12 slots and 13 bidders.
Figure 2 also shows that in principle, the optimal q may be negative.
To add a measure of reality to our simulations, we fit distributions for value and relevance to Yahoo!
The reason why efficiency and relevance suffer more with a reserve score is that this approach will often exclude bidders entirely , whereas this never
