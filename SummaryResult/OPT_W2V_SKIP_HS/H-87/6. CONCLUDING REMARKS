Our main conclusions from this study are the following: • Parameter optimization in AF is an open challenge but has not been thoroughly studied in the past.
• We found Rocchio performs strongly when a good validation corpus is available, and a preferred choice when optimizing Ctrk is the objective, favoring recall over precision to an extreme.
• We found LR more robust than Rocchio; it had the best results (in T11SU) ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11 without extensive tuning.
We presented a cross-benchmark evaluation of incremental Rocchio and incremental LR in adaptive filtering , focusing on their
