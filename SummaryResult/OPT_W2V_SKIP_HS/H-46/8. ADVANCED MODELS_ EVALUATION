First, we evaluated the models of the organizational units, using all topics (ALL) and only the main topics (MAIN).
8.2 Experimental setup Given that the self-assessments are also sparse in our collection, in order to be able to measure differences between the various  models, we selected a subset of topics, and evaluated (some of the) runs only on this subset.
