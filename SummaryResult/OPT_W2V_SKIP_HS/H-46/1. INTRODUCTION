For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is  representative of the type of intranet that we described above.
We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms?
This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.
In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from
