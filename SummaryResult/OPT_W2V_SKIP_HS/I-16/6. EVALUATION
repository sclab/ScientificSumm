Finally,  increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any  advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain.
In addition, we present results of experiments performed over a range of parameter values, and also with a mixed population of  advertising agents using both the advanced and simple bidding  strategies.
Figure 9 shows the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when the population is composed of different fractions of the two bidding
