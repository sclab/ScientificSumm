Rather than sending identical copies of the same data stream to all nodes in a tree and designing a scalable mechanism for recovering from loss, we propose that participants in a multicast overlay cooperate to strategically 282 transmit disjoint data sets to various points in the network.
For example , the failure of a single node should result only in a temporary reduction in the bandwidth delivered to a small subset of participants ; no single failure should result in the complete loss of data for any significant fraction of nodes , as might be the case for a single
