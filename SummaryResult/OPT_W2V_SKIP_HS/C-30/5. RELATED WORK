On the other hand, the fundamental goal of Bullet is to  increase bandwidth through download of disjoint data from multiple peers.
In this system, all nodes join at the root and migrate down to the point in the tree where they are still able to maintain some minimum level of bandwidth.
Since its foremost emphasis is reliability, the system does not attempt to improve the bandwidth delivered to the overlay participants by sending disjoint data at each level.
The key design goal of the tree construction mechanism is to have each node be an intermediate node in at most one
