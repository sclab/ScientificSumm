In the general case, our owning strategy attempts to make data disjoint among children subtrees with the guiding premise that, as much as possible, the expected number of nodes receiving a packet is the same across all packets.
When a data packet is received by a parent, it calculates the proportion of the total data stream that has been sent to each child, thus far, in this epoch.
To this end, Bullet distributes incoming packets among one or more children in hopes that the expected number of nodes receiving each packet is approximately the same.
It is important to realize
