Specifically, this  paper makes the following contributions: • We present the design and analysis of Bullet, an  overlay construction algorithm that creates a mesh over any distribution tree and allows overlay participants to achieve a higher bandwidth throughput than  traditional data streaming.
As a related benefit, we  eliminate the overhead required to probe for available  bandwidth in traditional distributed tree construction  techniques.
• We provide a technique for recovering missing data from peers in a scalable and efficient manner.
This paper presents the design and implementation of Bullet , a scalable and efficient overlay construction algorithm that overcomes this challenge
