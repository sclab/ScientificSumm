Since there is currently ample bandwidth available throughout the PlanetLab overlay (a characteristic not necessarily  representative of the Internet at large), we designed this experiment to show that Bullet can achieve higher bandwidth than an overlay tree when the source is constrained, for instance in cases of congestion on its outbound access link, or of  overload by a flash-crowd.
Thus, in this section we present a simple greedy oï¬„ine  algorithm to determine the connectivity of a tree likely to deliver a high level of bandwidth.
By not explicitly choosing which data to send its child , this approach deprives Bullet
