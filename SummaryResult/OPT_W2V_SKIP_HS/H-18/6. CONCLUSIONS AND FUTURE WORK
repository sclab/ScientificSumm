Our results also illustrated that  using weighted mutual information can utilize the information of multiple documents to reach a better performance.
More previous methods should be compared with.
Moreover, we also showed that doing  segmentation among multiple documents can improve the  performance tremendously.
We only tested our method on limited data sets.
Our approach outperforms all the previous methods on  singledocument cases.
Moreover,  natural segmentations like paragraphs are hints that can be used to find the optimal boundaries.
More data sets especially complicated ones should be tested.
We proposed a novel method for multi-document topic segmentation and alignment based on
