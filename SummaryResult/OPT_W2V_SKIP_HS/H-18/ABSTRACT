In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual information (MI) and weighted mutual information (WMI) that is a combination of MI and term weights.
Utilizing information from multiple documents can tremendously improve the  performance of topic segmentation, and using WMI is even better than using MI for the multi-document segmentation.
It can find the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among  documents at the same time.
Our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove
