We have a 3D matrix of term frequency , in which the three dimensions are random variables of D , Sd , and T. Sd actually is a random vector including a random variable for each d âˆˆ D. The term frequency can be used to estimate the joint probability distribution P ( D , Sd , T ) , which is p ( t , d , s ) = T ( t , d , s ) /ND , where T ( t , d , s ) is the number of t in d '' s sentence
