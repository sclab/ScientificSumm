Note that the size of Hv is bounded by (|E(H)| + 1)k , since each node in λ(v) is either left uncovered in a  packing or is covered with precisely one of the hyperedges in χ(v) ⊆ E(H).
Therefore , h∗ is a packing for H. It remains then to show that it has the maximum weight over all the packings for H. To this aim , we can use structural induction on T to prove that , in the bottom-up phase , the variable v hv is updated to contain the weight of the packing on
