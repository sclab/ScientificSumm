Based on this observation, and by exploiting the  properties of the hyperedges in DG, it is not difficult to show that any pair of consecutive vertices p and q must share two nodes of HG forming a pair in PG, and must both touch Sx (resp., Ty).
3) finally, we denote by DG the set containing the  hyperedges in E(HG) of the third kind.
Let G be an arbitrary item graph for HG , and let TD = T , Ï‡ be a 3-width tree decomposition of G ( note that , because of the cliques , e.g. ,
