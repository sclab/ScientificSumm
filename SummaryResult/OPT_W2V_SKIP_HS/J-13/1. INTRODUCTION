Let us note that the hypergraph representation H I,B of a combinatorial auction I, B is also useful to make the analogy between the winner  determination problem and the maximum weighted-set packing problem on hypergraphs clear (e.g., [17]).
Currently , the most general class of tractable combinatorial auctions has been singled out by modelling interactions among bidders with the notion of item graph , which is a graph whose nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with items , and edges are such that for any 152 Figure 1 : Example MaxWSP problem : ( a ) Hypergraph H I0 ,
