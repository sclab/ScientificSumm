Note that, as far as the maximum weighted-set packing problem is concerned, given a hypergraph H, we can always assume that for each node v âˆˆ N(H), {v} is in E(H).
In fact, if this hyperedge is not in the hypergraph, then it can be added without loss of generality, by setting w({v}) = 0.
Therefore, letting C(shw, k) denote the class of all the  hypergraphs whose dual hypergraphs (associated with maximum 2 The term +1 only plays the technical role of taking care of the different definition of width for tree decompositions and hypertree decompositions.
