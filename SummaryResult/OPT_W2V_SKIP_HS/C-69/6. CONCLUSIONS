Our results on multiple  mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.
We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.
pTHINC transparently supports traditional  desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with  ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.
We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs.
pTHINC provides key architectural and
