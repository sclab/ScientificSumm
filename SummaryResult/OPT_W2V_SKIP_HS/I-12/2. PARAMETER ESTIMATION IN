Consequently, in fast-paced environments, an agent needs a sampling strategy by which the CA samples its owner"s interruptibility level (with some cost) and decides whether to initiate an interaction at this specific time or to delay until a lower cost is observed in future samplings.
Figure 1 : The distribution structure affecting the expected cost '' s calculation 2.2 Estimating the Probability of Having Information One way an agent can estimate the probability a user will have information it needs ( e.g. , will know at a specific interruption time , with some level of reliability , the
