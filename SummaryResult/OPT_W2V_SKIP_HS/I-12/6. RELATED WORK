However, the method will perform poorly in scenarios in which the functions  alternate between different levels while keeping the general  structure and moments.
Similarly, clustering algorithms  designed for the task of class identification in spatial databases (e.g., relying on a density-based notion [4]) are not useful for our case, because our data has no spatial attributes.
In spite of the richness of available clustering algorithms ( such as the famous K-means clustering algorithm [ 11 ] , hierarchical methods , Bayesian classifiers [ 6 ] , and maximum entropy ) , various characteristics of fast-paced domains do not align well
