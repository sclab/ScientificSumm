In particular, our techniques would be useful in any setting in which a group of agents undertakes a task in a new environment, with each agent obtaining observations at a similar rate of individual  parameters they need for their decision-making.
The  characteristic to be learned is (or is clearly related to) an important  factor in the agent"s decision making.1 The basic setting we consider is one in which an agent accumulates observations about a  specific user characteristic and uses them to produce a timely estimate of some measure that depends on that characteristic"s distribution.
