The most straightforward method for the CA to learn the  distribution functions associated with the different parameters  characterizing an owner is by building a histogram based on the  observations it has accumulated up to the estimation point.
The number of additional  observations to be taken from each other agent is a function of the number of observations it currently has from former interactions with its owner and the level of confidence the CA has in the  similarity between its owner and other owners.
Any improvement that can be achieved in predicting the cost values , especially in the initial stages
