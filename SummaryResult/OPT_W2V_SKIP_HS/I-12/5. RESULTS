Since all simulation runs used for generating Figure 6 are based on the same seed, the performance of the self-learning mechanism is constant regardless of the number of types in the environment.
Finally, we measured the effect of the number of types in the environment.
For the Figure 4 environment , average-all is a good strategy for agents of type II , IV and V , because the theoretical reservation value of each of these types is close to the one obtained based on the aggregated distribution function ( i.e. , 21.27 ) .4 However , for types I and
