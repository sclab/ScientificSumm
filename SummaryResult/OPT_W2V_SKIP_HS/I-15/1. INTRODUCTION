However, as far as we know there is no work that demonstrates the effectiveness of a gradual tuning process in large-scale dynamic networks that studies the impact of the information gathered by agents as more and more queries are issued and served in concurrent sessions in the network.
Specifically, this paper proposes a method for information searching and sharing in dynamic and large scale networks, which combines routing indices with token-based methods for information sharing in large-scale multi-agent systems.
This fact , has resulted to efforts that either require agents to have a global view of the system [ 15
