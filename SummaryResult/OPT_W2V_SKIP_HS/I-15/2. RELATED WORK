However, this approach can not scale to large and dynamic networks, as it would be highly inefficient for each agent to compute and determine its potential needs and information provision abilities given its potential interaction with 100s of other agents.
Exploiting the models of other agents in the network, agents construct their view of the network which is being used for forming routing decisions.
In accordance to this approach, in [12,13,14], information sharing is considered only for static networks and self-tuning of networks is not demonstrated.
A major question concerning information searching is what information has to be shared between
