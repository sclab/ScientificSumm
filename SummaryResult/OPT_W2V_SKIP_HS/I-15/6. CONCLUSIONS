Specifically, the paper demonstrates through extensive performance experiments: (a) How networks of agents can be â€˜tuned" so as to provide requested information effectively, increasing the benefit and the efficiency of the system.
(b) How different types of local knowledge (number, local information repositories, percentage, interests and information provision abilities of acquaintances) can guide agents to effectively answer queries, balancing between efficiency and efficacy.
(d) That the information gathered and maintained by agents supports efficient and effective information searching and sharing: Initial information about acquaintances information provision abilities is not necessary and a small percentage of acquaintances suffices.
