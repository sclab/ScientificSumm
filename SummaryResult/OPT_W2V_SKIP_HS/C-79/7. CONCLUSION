However, deploying overlay over MANETs may result in either a large number of flooding operations triggered by the routing process, or inefficiency in terms of bandwidth usage.
On the other hand, if a proactive routing protocol is adopted, each peer has to periodically broadcast  control messages, which leads to poor efficiency in terms of  bandwidth usage.
In the case of a reactive routing protocol, routing on the overlay may cause a large number of flooded route discovery message since the routing path in each routing step must be  discovered on demand.
To facilitate resource discovery and distribution over MANETs ,
