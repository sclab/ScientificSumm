From Figure 8, we know the delay increases as the speed increases, which is due to the fact that with increasing speed,  clients will move out of mesh with higher probability.
Figure 6 shows that overhead also almost remains the same under various maximum number of concurrent updates.
Figure 7 shows that if updates happen more frequently, the  overhead is higher.
That"s because one more node just means one more flood over the mesh during update process so that the impact is limited.
