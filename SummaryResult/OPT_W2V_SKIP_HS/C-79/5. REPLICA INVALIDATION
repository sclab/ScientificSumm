Although validation mesh provides a conceptual topology that (1) connects all replicas together, (2) coordinates concurrent updates, and (3) disseminates invalidation packets, the technical issue is how such a mesh topology could be effectively and efficiently maintained and evolved when (a) nodes request and cache a  resource, (b) when nodes update their respective replicas and  invalidate other replicas, and (c) when nodes move.
Now we assume node G updates its replica of the file and informs the other nodes by sending an  invalidation packet over the validation mesh.
If a node holding a valid/updated replica doesn '' t hear a
