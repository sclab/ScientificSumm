In certain situations, it is also beneficial to make a resource readily available at multiple nodes when the  resource can be relocated and/or replicated, such as data files.
To realize this feature, the hybrid resource distribution scheme employs a different type of control packet, called resource  replication packet, which is responsible for finding an appropriate place to create a replica of a resource.
Furthermore , in MANETs , we should consider not only the amount of load handled by a resource provider , but also the load on those intermediate nodes that are located on the communication paths between the
