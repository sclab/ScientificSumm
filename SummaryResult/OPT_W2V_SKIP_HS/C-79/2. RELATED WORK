Our proposed resource replication mechanism, in contrast, attempts to replicate a data item in appropriate areas, instead of a large area around the server, where the item is requested frequently. 
Despite the mechanism to reduce control packets, high overhead may still be unavoidable, especially when there are many clients trying to locate different services, due to the fact that the algorithm relies on flooding, For resource replication, Yin and Cao [6] design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for MANETs.
For instance , Konark [ 2 ] makes use of a underlying multicast protocol such that service providers and queriers advertise
