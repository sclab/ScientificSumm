In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to title extraction from general documents.
In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models.
It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents.
Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain , and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and
