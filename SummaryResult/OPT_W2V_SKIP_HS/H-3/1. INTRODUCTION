So the important question is how we can serve these context words in queries to select the appropriate relations to apply.
However, the use of general knowledge gives rise to an enormous problem of knowledge ambiguity [31]: we are often unable to determine if a relation applies to a query.
So we call them context around query in this paper.
The shortage of domain knowledge has led to the utilization of general knowledge for query expansion [31], which is more available from resources such as thesauri, or it can be automatically extracted from documents [24][27].
It has been demonstrated
