This work can be further improved on several aspects, including other methods to extract term relations, to integrate more context words in conditions and to identify query domains.

Many previous studies have investigated the integration of some contextual factors in IR models, typically by incorporating a user profile.
This work also shows that the language modeling framework is appropriate for
