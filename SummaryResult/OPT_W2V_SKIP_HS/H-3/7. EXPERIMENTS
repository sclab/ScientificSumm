However, when both models are combined, there are additional improvements over the Feedback model, and these improvements are statistically significant in 2 cases out of 3.
First, it is interesting to notice that the incorporation of domain models can generally improve retrieval effectiveness in all the cases.
Table 3 shows the retrieval effectiveness on all the collections.
In this series of tests, each of the queries 51-150 is used in turn as the test query while the other queries and their relevant documents (C1) or top-ranked retrieved documents (C2) are used to create domain models.
We have tested both strategies
