If maximum likelihood estimation is used directly on these documents, the resulting domain model will contain both  domain-specific terms and general terms, and the former do not emerge.
Therefore, we employ an EM process to extract the specific part of the domain as follows: we assume that the documents in a domain are generated by a domain-specific model (to be extracted) and general language model (collection model).
This choice is also motivated by the possibility to compare between manual and automatic assignment of domain to a new query.
MODELS As in previous studies , we exploit a set of documents
