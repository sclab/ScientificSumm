The results for the case of a cheating seller in a second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as endpoints along a continuum.
In addition to providing strategy profiles that are stable against deviations, these  results give us with insights into both first and second-price auctions.
Finally, results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of cheating. 
In this paper we presented the equilibria of sealed-bid  auctions in which cheating is possible.
The case of agents cheating in a first-price auction showed the robustness
