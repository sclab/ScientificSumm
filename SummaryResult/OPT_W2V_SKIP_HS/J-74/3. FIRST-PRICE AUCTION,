Since we have left F(Â·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agent"s bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.
In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.
In fact , if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent j '' s strategy so
