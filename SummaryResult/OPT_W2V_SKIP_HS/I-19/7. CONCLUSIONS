The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.
For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.
For this setting, we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires a single item and derives no additional benefit from having more.
In future work , we intend to extend the
