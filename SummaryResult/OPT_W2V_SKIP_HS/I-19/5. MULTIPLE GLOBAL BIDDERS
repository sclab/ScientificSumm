Thus, our simulation can be used as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the  optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect a combination of local and global bidders. 
We now consider the best response strategies when both  local and global bidders participate and each auction contains the same number of local bidders.
7 Note that the number of possible allocations still increases with the number of auctions and global bids.
5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial
