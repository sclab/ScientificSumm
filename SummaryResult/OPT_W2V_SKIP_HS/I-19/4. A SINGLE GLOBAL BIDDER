4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing  probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.
Now, note that, in order to prove that H−1 (y) has at most two solutions, it is necessary and sufficient to show that H(b) has at most one local maximum for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax.
Therefore , we can ignore the first part , and the second part yields : bi = v bj ∈B\ { bi } (
