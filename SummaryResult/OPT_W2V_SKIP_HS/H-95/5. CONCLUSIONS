In queries where a geographical reference is not explicitly mentioned, we  propose to use the results for the query, exploiting geographic scopes previously assigned to these documents.
In a general purpose search engine, and if a local query is detected, we can forward users to a GIR system, which should be better suited for properly handling the query.
The proposed techniques for handling geographic queries can have many applications in improving GIR systems or even general purpose search engines.
After place references are appropriately disambiguated into ontology concepts , a GIR system can use them to retrieve relevant results ,
