In order to achieve accurate document retrieval results, many previous methods simply use resource selection algorithms that are effective of database recommendation system.
First, the DTF is a framework designed specifically for document retrieval, but our new model integrates two distinct applications with different requirements (database recommendation and distributed document retrieval) into the same unified framework.
The first problem of distributed information retrieval is resource representation.
Thus, in uncooperative environments, one common choice is query-based sampling, which randomly generates and sends queries to individual search engines and retrieves some documents to build the descriptions.
Although the ReDDE algorithm has been
