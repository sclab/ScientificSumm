Distributed information retrieval, also known as federated search [1,4,7,11,14,22] is different from ad-hoc information retrieval as it addresses the cases when documents cannot be acquired and stored in a single database.
This paper presents a unified utility maximization framework to integrate the resource selection problem of both database recommendation and distributed document retrieval together by treating them as different optimization goals.
Two key features make it a more solid model for distributed information retrieval : i ) It formalizes the resource selection problems of different applications as various utility functions , and optimizes the utility functions to achieve the
