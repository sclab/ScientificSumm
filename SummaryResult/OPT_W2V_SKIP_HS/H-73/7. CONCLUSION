This kind of inconsistency has also been observed in previous work, but the prior solutions either used heuristic methods or assumed cooperation by individual databases (e.g., all the databases used the same kind of search engines), which is frequently not true in the uncooperative environment.
Another extension of the framework is to consider the retrieval effectiveness of the online databases, which is an important issue in the operational environments.
One algorithm for resource selection (UUM/HR) and two algorithms for document retrieval (UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL) are derived from this framework.
( Search engines do not return document scores ) Precision at
