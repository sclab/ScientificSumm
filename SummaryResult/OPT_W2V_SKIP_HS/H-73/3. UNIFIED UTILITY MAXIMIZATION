However, in order to calculate the probabilities of relevance, we need to estimate centralized document scores for all documents across the databases instead of only the sampled documents.
The database selection decision is made based on the complete lists of probabilities of relevance for all the databases.
The complete lists of probabilities of relevance are inferred from all the available information specifically sR , which stands for the resource descriptions acquired by query-based sampling and the database size estimates acquired by sample-resample; cS stands for the centralized document scores of the documents in the centralized sample database.
The intuition behind the
