On the representative testbed, CORI is much less effective than other algorithms for distributed document retrieval (Tables 5 and 6).
On the Trec123-100Col testbed, the document retrieval effectiveness of the CORI selection algorithm is roughly the same or a little bit better than the ReDDE algorithm but both of them are worse than the other three algorithms (Tables 3 and 4).
In all of the experiments discussed in this section the results retrieved from individual databases were combined by the  semisupervised learning results merging algorithm.
One main difference between the UUM/HR algorithm and the ReDDE algorithm was pointed out before
