It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ReDDE and UUM/HR algorithms are more effective (on the representative, relevant and nonrelevant testbeds) or as good as (on the Trec123-100Col testbed) the CORI resource selection algorithm.
The database size statistics were estimated by the sample-resample method [21].
Fifty queries (101-150) were used as training queries to build the relevant logistic model and to fit the exponential functions of the centralized document score curves for large ratio databases (details in Section 3.1).
The resource descriptions were created using query-based sampling.
And let Bi and Ei denote the number of relevant documents
