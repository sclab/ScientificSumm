The proof follows trivially from the definition of the costs and payoffs: If we consider a path from point x to point x , both the net change in the vector lengths and the net projection onto the p-line are completely determined by x and x .
We invite them to play the game described below: At any point in the game, there is a current state  described by a pair of parameters, (x, y), which we sometimes write in vector form as x.
Then , the total cost of all the moves is equal to the cost of the single move
