The approach here is to sum the difference between the real value of a state to the maximal Q-value of this state if resource res cannot be used for all states in a trajectory given by the  policy of task ta.
For our problem, a reward of 1 Ã— wta is given when the state of a task (sta) is in an achieved state, and 0 in all other cases.
The global Q-value is the sum of the Q-values produced by each agent managing each task as shown in Line 11,  considering the global action a.
Furthermore , the
