To compute the lower bound of revenue-bound, all available resources have to be separated in many types or parts to be allocated.
Q-decomposition permits to diminish the planning time significantly in our problem settings, and seems a very efficient approach when a group of agents have to allocate resources which are only available to themselves, but the  actions made by an agent may influence the reward obtained by at least another agent.
Indeed, when the number of task to execute is high, the lower bounds by Singh-rtdp takes the values of a single task.
On the other hand , the
