The only  condition on the use of our bounds is to be in the context of stochastic constrained resource allocation.
This efficient trajectory of state updates can be combined to the approach proposed here since this paper focusses on the definition of tight bounds, and efficient state update for a constrained resource allocation problem.
In such problems, a scheduling process suggests the action (i.e.
When implemented with heuristic search , since the number of states and actions to consider when computing the optimal policy is exponentially reduced compared to other known approaches , Q-decomposition allows to formulate the first optimal
