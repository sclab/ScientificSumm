To address this complex resource management problem, a  Qdecomposition approach is proposed when the resources which are already shared among the agents, but the actions made by an agent may influence the reward obtained by at least another agent.
The Q-decomposition allows to  coordinate these reward separated agents and thus permits to reduce the set of states and actions to consider.
On the other hand, when the resources are available to all agents, no  Qdecomposition is possible and we use heuristic search.
This paper contributes to solve effectively stochastic  resource allocation problems known to be NP-Complete.
In particular , the
