However, if we compare a large set of clickthrough inversions to a similar set of pairs for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their  ranking, we would expect to see relatively more pairs where the snippet was missing in caption A.
The first feature concerns the existence of a snippet and the second concerns the relative size of snippets.
In other words, for pairs in this set, the result at the higher rank (caption A) received more clickthroughs than the result at the lower rank (caption B).
We extract a number of features characterizing snippets ( described in detail in
