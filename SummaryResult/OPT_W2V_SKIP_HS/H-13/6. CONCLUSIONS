To our knowledge, this is first methodology validated for  assessing the quality of Web captions through implicit  feedback.
We also hope to directly address the goal of predicting relevance from clickthoughs and other information present in search engine logs. 
Using clickthrough inversions, we have demonstrated that relatively simple  caption features can significantly influence user behavior.
In the future, we hope to substantially expand this work, considering more features over larger datasets.
Clickthrough inversions form an appropriate tool for  assessing the influence of caption features.
