Since the reservoir modeling research involves proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial efforts initially in educating the application researchers on the ability of Grid services in supporting the industry standard data security through role- and privilege-based access using X.509 standard.
The main issues are industry standard data security and QoS comparable to cluster computing.
It is our observation that training and outreach programs that compare and contrast the Grid and cluster computing environments would be a suitable approach for enhancing user participation in Grid computing.
This approach also helps users to match their applications and abilities
