This approach has several advantages over MPI implementation especially when a site specific cluster is heavily loaded and/or the number licenses required for the simulation is more than those available at a single site.
Another aspect of interest in the near future would be managing both compute and license resources to address the job (or processor)-to-license ratio management. 
We have demonstrated that by pooling licenses across TIGRE sites, more geological models can be handled in parallel and therefore conceivably better simulation accuracy.
Towards the future work , it would be interesting to compare the runtime between MPI , and
