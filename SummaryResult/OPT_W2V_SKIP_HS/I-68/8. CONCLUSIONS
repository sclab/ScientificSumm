Beyond OC-DEC-MDP, there are other locally optimal algorithms for DEC-MDPs and  DECPOMDPs [8] [12], [13], yet, they have traditionally not dealt with uncertain execution times and temporal constraints.
Our heuristic solution method, called Value Function Propagation (VFP), provided two  orthogonal improvements of OC-DEC-MDP: (i) It speeded up  OC-DECMDP by an order of magnitude by maintaining and manipulating a value function for each method rather than a separate value for each pair of method and time interval, and (ii) it achieved better solution qualities than OC-DEC-MDP because it corrected the  overestimation of the opportunity cost of OC-DEC-MDP.
