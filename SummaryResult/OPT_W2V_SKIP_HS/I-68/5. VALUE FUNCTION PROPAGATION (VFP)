5.3 Probability Function Propagation Phase Assume now, that value functions and opportunity cost values have all been propagated from sink methods to source nodes and the sets Zj for all methods mj ∈ M have been identified.
Probability Function , denoted as Pi ( t ) , that maps time t ∈ [ 0 , Δ ] to the probability that method mi will be completed before time t. Such functional representation allows us to easily read the current policy , i.e. , if an agent Ak is at method mi at time t , then it will wait as
