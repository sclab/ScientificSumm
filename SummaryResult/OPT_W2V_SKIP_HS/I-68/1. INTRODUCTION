In this context, we present VFP (= Value Function P ropagation), an efficient solution technique for the DEC-MDP model with  temporal constraints and uncertain method execution durations, that builds on the success of OC-DEC-MDP.
Additionally, OC-DEC-MDP is unique in its ability to address both temporal constraints and uncertain method execution durations, which is an important factor for real-world  domains.
Finally , in section 7 we demonstrate empirically the impact of our two orthogonal improvements , i.e. , we show that : ( i ) The new heuristics correct the opportunity cost overestimation problem leading to higher quality policies , and (
