Finally, if Vj0 is split in a way, that for some k, Vj0,ik = 0, it is the method mik that underestimates the opportunity cost of enabling method mj0 , and the similar reasoning applies.
â€¢ Heuristic bH 1,1 : This is a normalized version of the H 1,1 heuristic in that each method [mik ]K k=0 initially gets the full opportunity cost for enabling the method mj0 .
So far , we have taken the same approach as in [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] in that the opportunity cost function Vj0 , ik that the method mik sends back to
