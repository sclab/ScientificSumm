AND JAVA MESSAGE SERVICE (JMS) Message-oriented middleware systems support  communication between distributed components via message-passing: the sender sends a message to identified queues, which  usually reside on a server.
Receivers can be  registered with some specific queues, and can asynchronously retrieve the messages and then acknowledge them.
However, given the way they are implemented, these middleware systems usually require resource-rich devices, especially in terms of memory and disk space, where persistent queues of messages that have been received but not yet processed, are stored.
Clients can send and receive messages , asynchronously , through the JMS provider , which is
