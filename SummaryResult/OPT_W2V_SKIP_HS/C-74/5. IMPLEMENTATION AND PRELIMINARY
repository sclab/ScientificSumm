One consequence of the dimensioning problem is that  scalability may be seriously impacted in peer-to-peer  middleware for mobile computing due to the resource poverty of the devices (limited memory to store temporarily messages) and the number of possible interconnections in ad-hoc  settings.
This problem arises because of the lack of intelligence in the epidemic protocol, and can be addressed by selecting carrier nodes for messages with greater care.
We also evaluated the middleware platform using the OMNET++ discrete event simulator [ 17 ] in order to explore a range of mobile scenarios that incorporated a more realistic number of hosts
