Traditionally, the most frequently used middleware  primitives for communication assume the simultaneous presence of both end points on a network, since the stability and  pervasiveness of the networking infrastructure is not an  unreasonable assumption for most wired environments.
With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and their widespread adoption, there is a clear need to allow the  development of a broad spectrum of applications that operate  effectively over such an environment.
There have been attempts to provide mobile middleware with these properties, including STEAM, LIME,  XMIDDLE, Bayou (see [11] for a more complete review of mobile middleware).
Aside from the
