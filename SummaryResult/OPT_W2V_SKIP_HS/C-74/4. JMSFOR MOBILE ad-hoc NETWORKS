We use acknowledgment messages not only to inform senders about the successful delivery of messages but also to delete the replicas of the delivered messages that are still present in the network.
This mechanism is the one that distinguishes the delivery of persistent and non-persistent messages in our JMS implementation: the deliveries of the former are notified to the senders, whereas the latter are not.
Queues are advertised periodically to the hosts that are within transmission range or that are reachable by means of the underlying synchronous communication protocol, if  provided.
