The direct and random protocols for one-hour TTL had delivery ratios that were too low to be visible in the plot.
The number of message transmissions of  epidemic routing was more than 10 times higher than for the  predictionbased routing protocols.
4.4 Metrics We define a set of metrics that we use in evaluating routing  protocols in opportunistic networks: â€¢ delivery ratio, the ratio of the number of messages delivered to the number of total messages generated.
For direct delivery , random , and the probability-based routing protocols , relatively few messages were delivered for short TTLs , so many
