There are many parameters for prediction-based routing protocols, however, and different parameters may produce different results.
Indeed, there is an opportunity for some adaptation; for example, high priority messages may be given higher transfer and  replication probabilities to increase the chance of delivery and reduce the delay, or a node with infrequent contact may choose to raise its transfer probability.
The prediction-based  routing protocols had a delivery ratio more than 10 times better than that for direct-delivery and random routing, and fewer  transmissions and less storage usage than epidemic routing.
None of these protocols ( direct-delivery , random and epidemic
