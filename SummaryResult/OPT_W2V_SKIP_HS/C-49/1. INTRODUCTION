Note that  traditional Internet routing protocols and ad-hoc routing protocols, such as AODV [20] or DSDV [19], assume that a contemporaneous  endto-end path exists, and thus fail in mobile opportunistic networks.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate the effect of routing protocols in a large-scale mobile opportunistic network, using realistic contact traces derived from real traces of a production network with more than 5, 000 users.
In this paper, we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people.
Opportunistic networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange information
