Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of  different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the  equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour.
Finally , it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement ( reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2 ) , but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of
