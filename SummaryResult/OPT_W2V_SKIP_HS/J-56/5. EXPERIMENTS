The revenues of repair  solutions are bounded by at least 90% of the optimum in our  experiments thereby allowing a direct comparison with robust solutions already found using the same revenue constraint but not providing for backtracking.
An interesting feature of the arbitrary-npv distribution is that optimal solutions can become more brittle as the number of bids increases.
It can be clearly seen from Table 4 that when revenue constraints on repair solutions are tight, there are fewer winning bids in the optimal robust solution on average.
