These bidders may associate a higher value for these items if they were combined with items already awarded to others, hence the bid-taker is left in an undesirable local optimum in which a form of backtracking is required to reallocate the items in a manner that results in sufficient revenue.
We have called this the Bid-taker"s Exposure Problem that bears similarities to the Exposure  Problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items.
Revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such auctions ,
