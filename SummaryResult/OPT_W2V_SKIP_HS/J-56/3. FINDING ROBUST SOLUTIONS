Backtracking may then occur for one of two reasons: we cannot extend the assignment to satisfy the given constraints, or the current  partial assignment cannot be associated with a repair solution whose cost of repair is less than Î² should a break occur.
An (a,b)-super solution is one in which if at most a variables lose their values, a repair solution can be found by changing at most b other variables [10].
A classical super solution ( SS ) is a solution to a CSP in which , if a small number of variables lose their
