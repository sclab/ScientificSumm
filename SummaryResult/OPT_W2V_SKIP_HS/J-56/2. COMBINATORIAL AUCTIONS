Consider the example in Table 1, and the optimal expected  revenue in the situation where a single bid may be withdrawn.
A robust solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution.
This means that the optimal solution need not necessarily sell all of the items.
For example , if the item is a service contract for a given period of time
