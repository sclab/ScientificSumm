We would like to extend our sincerest thanks to Jill Lehman whose efforts in data collection were essential in constructing the corpus, and both Jill and Aaron Steinfeld for their direction of the HCI experiments.
Our empirical analysis has demonstrated that n-grams are of key importance to making the most of  documentlevel judgments.
Further  experiments are needed to see how this interacts with the amount of  training data available.
When finer-grained judgments are available , then a standard bag-of-words approach using a small ( sentence ) window size and automatic segmentation techniques can produce results almost as good as the
