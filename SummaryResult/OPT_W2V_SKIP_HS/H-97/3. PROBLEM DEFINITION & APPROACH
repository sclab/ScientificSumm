The obvious benefit of the document-level approach is that training set collection costs are lower since the user only has to specify whether or not an e-mail contains an action-item and not the specific sentences.
Therefore, in order to consider the prediction to be too short, there will be an additional  preceding/following sentence that is an action-item where we incorrectly predicted no.
Once trained , applying the resulting classifiers to sentence detection is now straightforward , but in order to apply the classifiers to document detection and document ranking , the individual predictions over each sentence must be aggregated in
