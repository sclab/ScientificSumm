This is because, for the normal distribution, μ = 10 ensures that for almost all the players the weight is positive, and ν = 1 is used most commonly in statistical experiments (ν can be higher or lower but PE is increasing in  νsee Equations 4 and 5).
We know that, for a sample of size X, the sum of the players" weights is distributed normally with mean Xμ and variance ν/X.
Since 99 % of a normal distribution lies within two standard deviations of its mean [ 8 ] , player i '' s marginal contribution to a sample of
