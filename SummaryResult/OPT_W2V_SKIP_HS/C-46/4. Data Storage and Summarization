The mechanism works as follows: In addition to the summary of sensor data, each node sends metadata to the proxy containing the time interval corresponding to the summary, as well as the start and end offsets of the flash memory location where the raw data corresponding is stored (as shown in Figure 7).
When a query matches a summary in the index, the sensor uses these offsets to access the relevant records on its local flash by sequentially  reading data from the start address until the end address.
Changing the size of the data summary can be performed in an
