The cost of  implementing this in our system is low - Figure 10(b) shows the overhead of such a redundancy scheme, where a single coarse summary is send to a backup for every two summaries sent to the primary proxy.
Since the previous experiments assumed 32 proxies, we evaluate the impact of the number of proxies on skip graph performance.
Sparse skip graphs require fewer pointer updates ; however , their overhead is dependent on the number of proxies , and is O ( log2Np ) in the expected case , independent of n. This can be seen to result
