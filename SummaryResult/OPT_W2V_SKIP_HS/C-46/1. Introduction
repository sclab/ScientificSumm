Archival storage of past sensor data requires a storage system, the key  attributes of which are: where the data is stored, whether it is indexed, and how the application can access this data in an energy-efficient manner with low latency.
Storage at the remote sensor is in effect treated as appendage of the proxy, resulting in low  implementation complexity, which makes it ideal for small,  resourceconstrained sensor platforms.
Sensors in these applications sense the environment and generate data that must be processed, filtered, interpreted, and archived in order to provide a useful  infrastructure to its users.
