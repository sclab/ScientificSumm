We presented the design of TSAR, a fundamentally different storage architecture that envisions separation of data from metadata by employing local storage at the sensors and distributed indexing at the proxies.
Our experimental  evaluation of TSAR demonstrated the benefits and feasibility of  employing our energy-efficient low-latency distributed storage architecture in multi-tier sensor networks.
At the sensor tier, TSAR supports energy-aware adaptive summarization that can trade-off the energy cost of  transmitting metadata to the proxies against the overhead of false hits  resulting from querying a coarser resolution index structure.
We implemented TSAR in a two-tier sensor testbed comprising Stargatebased proxies and
