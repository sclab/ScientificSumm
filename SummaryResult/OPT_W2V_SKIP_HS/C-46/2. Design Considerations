The key  features of the system design are as follows: In TSAR, writes occur at sensor nodes, and are assumed to  consist of both opaque data as well as application-specific metadata.
Thus, applications see a unified view of distributed data, and can query the index at any proxy to get access to data stored at any sensor.
The proxy uses the summary to construct an index; the index is global in that it stores information from all sensors in the  system and it is distributed across the various proxies in the system.
This metadata is a tuple of known types
