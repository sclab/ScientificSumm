The RISE platform [21] being developed as part of the NODE project at UCR addresses the issues of hardware platform support for large amounts of storage in remote sensor nodes, but not the indexing and querying of this data.
In order to efficiently access a distributed sensor store, an index needs to be constructed of the data.
In addition to storage and indexing techniques specific to sensor networks, many distributed, peer-to-peer and spatio-temporal index structures are relevant to our work.
In this section, we review prior work on storage and indexing techniques for sensor networks.
One such scheme is DCS
