In the case of learning a ranked retrieval function, X  denotes a space of queries, and Y the space of (possibly weak) rankings over some corpus of documents C = {d1, .
Table 3 shows the predictions of the two hypotheses on a single query x. Hypothesis MAP Best Acc.
We can define average precision loss as ∆map ( y , ˆy ) = 1 − MAP ( rank ( y ) , rank ( ˆy ) ) , where rank ( y ) is a vector of the rank values of each document in C. For example , for a corpus
