Tables 9 and 10 present the results of SVM∆ map, SVM∆ roc, and SVMacc when trained on the Indri retrieval functions and TREC  submissions, respectively.
Using this setup, we performed the same experiments while using our method (SVM∆ map), an SVM optimizing for ROCArea (SVM∆ roc) [13], and a conventional classification SVM (SVMacc) [20].
Given that many of these submissions use scoring functions which are carefully crafted to achieve high MAP, it is possible that the best performing submissions use techniques which subsume the techniques of the other submissions.
The W/L columns show the number of queries where SVM∆ map
