The new algorithm also makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for accuracy and ROCArea.
In this paper, we present a general approach for learning ranking functions that maximize MAP performance.
As a  result, finding good probabilities requires solving a more  difficult problem than necessary, likely requiring more training data to achieve the same MAP performance.
Performance measures  optimized include accuracy [17, 15], ROCArea [1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 21] or modifications of ROCArea [4], and NDCG [2, 3].
However , most current approaches do not optimize for the evaluation measure
