We computed the scores of these five retrieval methods over the three indices, giving 15 base functions in total.
We ran our main experiments using four choices of F: the set of aforementioned Indri retrieval functions for TREC 9 and TREC 10, and the Web Track submissions for TREC 9 and TREC 10.
We generated our features using the scores of existing retrieval functions on these queries.
For each F and each function f âˆˆ F , we chose 50 values for Kf which are reasonably spaced and capture the sensitive region of f. Using the four choices of F
