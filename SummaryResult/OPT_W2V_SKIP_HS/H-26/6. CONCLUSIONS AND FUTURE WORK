Our new method makes it conceptually just as easy to optimize SVMs for MAP as was previously possible only for Accuracy and ROCArea.
We have presented an SVM method that directly  optimizes MAP.
The learning framework used by our method is fairly  general.
Since other methods typically require tuning multiple heuristics, we also expect to train fewer models before finding one which achieves good performance.
The computational cost for training is very reasonable in practice.
We have shown  empirically that our method is generally superior to or  competitive with conventional SVMs methods.
A natural extension of this framework would be
