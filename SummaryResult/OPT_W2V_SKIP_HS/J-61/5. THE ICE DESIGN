We can illustrate the formulation (9) on  Example 2, assuming for simplicity that vα = v (i.e.
Fixing the values in ˜vi on nodes satisfied in L∗ i has the effect of removing this consideration when a trade U∗ i is selected that satisfies one of these nodes.
We show in Proposition 1 that the RP rule is satisfied if and only if π∗ l ≥ π∗ u. Constructing the modified valuation as ˜vi recognizes that there is shared uncertainty across trades that satisfy the same nodes in a bid tree.
The α-valuation is a linear combination of the current upper
