Then, we introduce the basic  components for a simple one-shot variation in which bidders state their exact values for trades in a single round.
The main innovation in our design is an expressive yet  concise tree-based bidding language (which generalizes known languages such as XOR/OR [23]), and the tight coupling of this language with efficient algorithms for price-feedback to guide bidding, winner-determination to determine trades, and revealed-preference activity rules to ensure progress across rounds.
For instance , when there exist linear prices we establish soundness and completeness : for straightforward bidders that adjust their bounds to meet activity rules while
