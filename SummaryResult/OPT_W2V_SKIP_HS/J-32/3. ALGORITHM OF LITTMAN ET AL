We will show later that a sufficient condition for the construction of such a data structure is the invariant that, at every level of the upstream pass, Ë†B(W, V ) contains a continuous path from w = 0 to w = 1.
The best response policy for V is not a breakpoint policy (because of how the curve from w = 0 to w = 1 doubles back).
The proof proceeds by ordering the children '' s breakpoints ( i.e. , the respective values of v ) from left to right ( it can be assumed without loss of generality that all these breakpoints
