The values for vi that may occur in a Nash equilibrium are those for which all dependent vj values lie in (0, 1); the latter condition is easy to check by computing the image of the interval (0, 1) under respective fractional linear transforms. 
For the second search, note that if Vi plays a mixed strategy, then vi+1 and vi−1 satisfy an equation of the form vi+1 = (A0 + A1vi−1)/(B0 + B1vi−1).
and ultimately vi itself to obtain a quadratic  equation (for vi) that is simple to derive from the payoffs in the game.
If the equation is non-trivial it has
