, g3n will be the 3n inputs to C. All players in the graphical game G constructed in [4] have 2 actions denoted 0 and 1.
A reduction from search problem S to problem S is a mechanism that shows that any polynomial-time algorithm for S implies a polynomial-time algorithm for S. It consists of functions f and g , computable in polynomial time , where f maps inputs of S to inputs of S , and g maps solutions of S to solutions of S , in such a way that if IS is an input to S , and
