As v = 0, 1, V is, in fact, indifferent between playing 0 and 1, which is only possible if w = f(vj−1).
Since w = f(u), V is indifferent between  playing 0 and 1; in particular, it can play v. Therefore, if we define vj+1 = w, the vector of strategies (v1, .
In this case 0 ∈ pbrV ( w ) for some w ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] if and only if there exists a u ∈ pbrU ( 0 ) such that u ≤ −A0/A1 : if no such u exists , whenever V plays 0 either U
