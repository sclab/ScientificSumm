, n, let the payoffs of Sk and Tk be the same as those for the U and V described in Section 3; recall that the  breakpoint policies for U and V are shown in Figure 2.
As in previous section, we can show that B(W, V ) is equal to ˆf(0) ∪ ˆf(B(V, U1) × · · · × B(V, Uk)) ∪ ˆf(1) [0, 1]2 ; also, any path from w = 0 to w = 1 that is a subset of B(W, V ) constitutes a valid breakpoint policy.
Fix k < n , and let
