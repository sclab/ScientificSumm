3.2 Evaluation Metrics In the experiments, we set the number of clusters equal to the true number of classes C for all the clustering  algorithms.
(31) is used as a performance measure for the given clustering result.
The final  discretization method adopted in these two methods is the same as in [26], since our experiments show that using such method can achieve better results than using kmeans based methods as in [20].
For computational efficiency , in the implementation of CPLR and our CLGR algorithm , we have set all the local regularization parameters { Î»i } n i=1 to
