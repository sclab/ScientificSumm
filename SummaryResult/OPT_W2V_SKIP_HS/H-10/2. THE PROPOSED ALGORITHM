2.2.3 Combining the Local Regularized Predictors After all the local predictors having been constructed, we will combine them together by minimizing Jl = n i=1 w∗T i xi − qi 2 , (10) which stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors.
2 We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold, since it is impossible for them to for ∀x ∈ M, q(x) returns the cluster membership of x.
Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1 , we choose
