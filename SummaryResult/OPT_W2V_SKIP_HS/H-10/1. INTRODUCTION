For  example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches, it generally aims to  optimize some cut value (e.g.
On the other hand, partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually  optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions.
the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix.
The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [ 31 ] , and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show
