In this paper, we propose a novel method for clustering  documents using regularization.
Finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.
Unlike traditional globally  regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer.
So we call our algorithm Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).
We will show that the cluster memberships of the documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix , which
