Therefore, technically, we do not prove the lower bound for (number of candidates, number of voters) pairs (m, n) that do not satisfy these assumptions (for  example, if we make the above assumption, then we technically do not prove the lower bound for any pair (m, n) in which n is even).
For example, for  every one of our lower bounds it is the case that for infinitely many values of m, there are infinitely many values of n such that the lower bound is proved for the pair (m, n). 
It is known that if a fooling set of
