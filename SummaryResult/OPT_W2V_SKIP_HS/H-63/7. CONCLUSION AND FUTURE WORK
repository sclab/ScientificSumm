The mapping of data with locations and the indexing scheme will be used in our DAYS project to create the push based architecture.
In this paper we have presented a scheme for mapping of wireless broadcast data with their locations.
We have used the containment property of LDD in the scheme that limits the search to a narrow range of data in the broadcast, thus saving valuable energy in the device.
We have presented a scheme called LBIS to index this LDD.
We will show that the LDD scheme together with the data staging architecture significantly improves the latency for
