As the length of the broadcast increases, after a certain point, though the tuning time increases as a result of factors which we have described before, the scheme always performs better than the other two schemes.
We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the length of broadcast increases.
The example discussed and Algorithm 1 reveals that to access any data, we need to access the major index only once followed by one or more accesses to the minor index.
Due to the prescribed limit of the number of pages in the paper , we are
