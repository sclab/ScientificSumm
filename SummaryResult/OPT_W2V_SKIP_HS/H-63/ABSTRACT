Access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme.
We prove our argument with the help of simulation results.
None of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data (LDD) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination.

Push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast.
In this paper , we discuss the broadcast of LDD in our project DAta in Your Space ( DAYS ) , and propose
