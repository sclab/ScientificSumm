All of the above mentioned schemes have been applied to data which are non related to each other.
This is based on the containment property of location dependent data.
As such, each node in the non-replicated part appears only once in a broadcast and, hence, reduces the replication cost and access latency while achieving a good tuning time.
In this scheme, a parameterized index, called the exponential index is used to optimize the access latency or the tuning time.
The first bucket in each data segment contains a control index , which is a binary index mapping a given key
