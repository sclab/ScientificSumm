The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.
The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.
Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation , the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several
