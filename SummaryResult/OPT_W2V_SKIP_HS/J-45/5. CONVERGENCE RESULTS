Then n(s) → (s) a.s. uniformly on S. Recall that N is a set of all Nash equilibria of Γ.
Now, let Nn denote all Nash equilibria of the game Γn and let Nδ = [ x∈N BS(x, δ), that is, the union of open balls of radius δ with centers at Nash equilibria of Γ.
We will now show that in the special case when Θ and A are finite and each Γθ has a unique Nash equilibrium, the estimates ˆθ of optimal designer parameter converge to an actual optimizer almost surely.
Then ˆθ is a consistent estimator of
