Our analysis focuses on the setting of storage costs (taking other game modifications as fixed), since this is the most direct  deterrent to early procurement adopted.
Finally, we conclude from our data that it is very unlikely that any reasonable setting of storage costs would  result in acceptable levels of day-0 procurement, so a different design approach would have been required to eliminate this problem.
In response to the problem, the TAC/SCM designers adopted several rule changes intended to penalize large day-0 orders.
Several participants noted that the predominance of day-0 procurement overshadowed other key research issues , such as
