Typically we care about W (N(θ), θ), the worst-case outcome of playing some solution.4 On some problems we can gain considerable advantage by  using an aggregation function to map the welfare outcome of a game 3 We generally adopt Nash equilibrium as the solution concept, and thus take N(θ) to be the set of equilibria.
Alternatively, given a simulator that could produce an  unbiased sample from the distribution of W (N(θ), θ) for any θ, the designer would be faced with another much appreciated problem in the literature: simulation optimization [12].
For example , suppose-as in our
