The success of our analysis in this extremely complex environment with high  simulation costs makes us optimistic that our methods can provide  guidance in making mechanism design decisions in other challenging domains.
A difficult design issue in the TAC/SCM game which the TAC community has been eager to address provides us with a setting to test our methods.
In applying empirical game analysis to the problem at hand, we are fully aware that our results are inherently inexact.
Our techniques are designed specifically to deal with problems in which both the mechanism parameter space and the agent strategy sets are
