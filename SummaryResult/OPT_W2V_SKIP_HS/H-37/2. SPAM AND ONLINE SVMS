Because  previous work (and our own initial testing) indicates that binary feature values give the best results for spam filtering [20, 9], we optimized our implementation of the Online SMO to exploit fast inner-products with binary vectors.
Early work on SVM based spam detection [9] showed that high values of C give best performance with binary features.
We use binary feature scoring, which has been shown to be most effective for a variety of spam detection  methods [20, 9].
A variant for linear SVMs was recently proposed which trains in O ( ns ) time [ 15 ] , but
