Our initial tests showed that the maximum number of iterations used by Online SMO was rarely much larger than 10 on content-based spam detection; thus we tested values of T = {1, 2, 5, âˆž}.
4.1.1 Testing Reduced Size For our first ROSVM test, we experiment on the effect of reducing the size of the optimization problem by only considering the p most recent examples, as described in the previous section.
Here we test the effect that each of these methods has on both effectiveness and efficiency.
For this test , we use the same 4-gram mappings as for the reference
