In contrast to traditional spatial indexing methods that construct an index on the moving objects, it builds an index on the continuous range queries, assuming that the queries move infrequently while the objects move freely.
As long as any object resides in this region, all the query results are guaranteed to be valid in the  system.
However, these algorithms assume that all the candidate visible objects have been stored locally.
Instead of traversing a tree from the root node for frequent update requests ( top-down approach ) , it directly accesses the leaf node of the object to be updated
