The expected time of any single entity update for edge indexing with full update is: T edgefull per update = Èo∈O T edgefull per update (o) |O| = 2(m + 1)(Ta + Td) (5) The analysis of the expected time of any single entity update for edge indexing with incremental update becomes complicated  because the time cost depends both on the side length of the entity AOI and on the moving speed.
In this table , it is evident that while the update cost of the worst-case edge indexing ( single-table edge indexing with full update policy ) depends only on m
