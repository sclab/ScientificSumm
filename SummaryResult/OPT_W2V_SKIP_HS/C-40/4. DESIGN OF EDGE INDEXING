First, we split a single edge structure that  indexes both stationary and moving entities into two separate edge 406 Table 1: Summary of notations for virtual entities and their properties.
Query processing for the spectator S means to search the node structure whose cell region intersects with S. In Figure 3(a), E2 is indexed on the same cell, thus being delivered to the client S after the query evaluation.
We also define two data structures for storing and retrieving the tokens: a node and an edge.
The two-step algorithm can also be used for our edge indexing by updating
