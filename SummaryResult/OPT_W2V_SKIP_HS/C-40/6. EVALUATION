Figure 10 reveals the performance  difference between the exhaustive solutions and the two-table methods, a difference of up to two orders of magnitude.
As a result, we can roughly anticipate that at least the 20Ã—20 grid cell partitioning retrieves a higher quality of visible sets than the RQ-OP.
The program performs intersection tests between all user and all object entities exhaustively and computes the P, R, and E-measure values (shown in Table 5).
If a virtual space is partitioned into tiled cells and a user point belongs to one of the cells , the ACQ-OR searches the objects whose AOI
