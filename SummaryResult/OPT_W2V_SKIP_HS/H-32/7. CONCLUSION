Using this perspective, we have shown that using a combination of a carefully selected external corpus, matching against multiple centroids and taking into consideration rare but highly topic  specific terms, we can build a definitional question answering  module that is more focused on identifying nuggets that are of interest to human beings.
Indeed, this is natural as the two models have been designed to identify two very different types of definition answers using very different types of features.
Our approach may also provide some insight into a few anomalies in past definitional question answering"s trials.
