However, the bounded property is not required here as we are only treating the divergence computed by JS divergence as term weights 5.2 Selecting Web Resources In one of our initial experiments, we observed that the quality of web resources included in the Interest Corpus may have a direct impact on the results we obtain.
We view this as a positive indication that low frequency terms can indeed be useful in finding interesting nuggets.
As a result , we found that KL Divergence has a bias towards highly frequent topic terms as we are measuring direct dissimilarity against a model
