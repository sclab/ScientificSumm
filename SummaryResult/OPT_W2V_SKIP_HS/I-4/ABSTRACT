In order to appropriately order and structure the negotiations occurring in the chain so as to  optimize the expected utility, we present an extension to a  singleagent concurrent negotiation framework.
This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing a better negotiation solution in the global negotiation chain context.
The agent can also use this  information to allocate appropriate time for each negotiation, hence to find a good ordering of all related negotiations.
Using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the  relationship of flexibility and success probability.
