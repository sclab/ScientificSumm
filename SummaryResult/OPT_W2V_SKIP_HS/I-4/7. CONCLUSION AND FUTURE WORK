We also recognize that the current approach of applying the meta-level information is mainly heuristic, so we would like to develop a learning  mechanism that enables the agent to learn how to use such information to adjust its local model from previous experience.
This more accurate model helps the agent in choosing the appropriate negotiation  solution.
Instead of solving the negotiation chain problem in a centralized approach, we adopt a distributed  approach where each agent has an extended local model and  decisionmaking process.
To further verify this distributed approach , we would like to develop a centralized approach , so
