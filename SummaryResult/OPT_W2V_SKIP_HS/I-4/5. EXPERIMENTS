One Purchase Computer task is generated every 15 time units, three Purchase Memory tasks are generated every 2 We only measure the utility collected after the learning phase  because that the learning phase is relatively short comparing to the evaluation phase, also during the learning phase, no meta-level  information is used, so some of the policies are invalid.
To focus on the study of flexibility, in this experiment, the regular rewards for each type of tasks are fixed and not under negotiation.
Therefore , the success probability increases and fewer tasks are rejected or canceled ( 90 % of the
