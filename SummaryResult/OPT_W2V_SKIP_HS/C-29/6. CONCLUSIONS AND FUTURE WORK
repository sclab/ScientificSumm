This can eliminate  unnecessary communication and the initialization at each call in CONFLEX-G. CONFLEX-G can achieves performance comparable to CONFLEX MPI and exploits more computing resources by allowing the use of multiple PC clusters in the grid.
This feature is especially important in large-scale applications which require lengthy calculation in a grid environment.
We need to refine the algorithm used to generate the trial structure in order to improve the load balance optimization for trial structures in CONFLEX.
In grid environments in which the environment changes dynamically, it is also necessary to support fault tolerance.
We plan to refine the
