We implemented the worker program of CONFLEX-G to receive data, such as evaluation parameters of energy, from a client program and to be initialized by the Initialize function.
To call the structure optimization function in a worker program from the client program, we use the OmniRpcCallAsync API, which is  intended for asynchronous RPC.
It is necessary for the application without the OmniRPC AIM facility to initialize at each RPC.
The user can define an  initialization procedure in the remote executable in order to send and store data automatically in advance of actual remote procedure calls.
When the agent and the
