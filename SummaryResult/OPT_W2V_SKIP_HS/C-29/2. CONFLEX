When all of the trial structures related to a given initial structure are optimized, only the master  procedure is used in comparison.
In order to remain in the low-energy region and perform an exhaustive search, the search limit (SEL), which  determines the maximum energy of the initial structures, is pre-defined.
CONFLEX [1] is an efficient conformational space search program, which can predominately and exhaustively search the conformers in the lower-energy region.
Comparison of the successfully optimized (trial)  structures with the other conformers stored in a  conformation database, and preservation of newly discovered unique conformers in the database.
