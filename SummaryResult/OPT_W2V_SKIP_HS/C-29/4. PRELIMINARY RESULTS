â€¢ In this experiment, we used a simple build-in  roundrobbin scheduler of OmniRPC, which is necessary in order to apply the scheduler that allocates structures with long optimization times to a high-performance Table 8: Statistics of elapsed time of trial structure optimization using 28 workers in the Dennis cluster.
Figure 3 also summarizes the amount of data transmission required for initialization of a worker program and for optimization of each trial  structure.
In order to speed up trial structures , hybrid programming using OmniRPC and OpenMP in an SMP ( Symmetric Multiple Processor ) machine may be one of the
