In order to support a typical application for a grid  environment, such as a parametric search application, in which the same function is executed with different input parameters on the same data set.
In this paper, we describe CONFLEX-G, a grid-enabled molecular conformational search program, using OmniRPC and report its performance in a grid of several PC  clusters which are geographically distributed.
In this paper, we propose the OmniRPC persistence model to a Grid RPC system and demonstrate its effectiveness.
Although the parallelized version of CONFLEX was used to calculate in parallel the structure optimization , which takes up over
