Recently, an algorithm has been developed that solves the problems of parallelization and communication in poorly connected processors to be used for simulation.
SETI@home tackles immensely parallel problems, in which calculation can easily be divided among several computers.
SETI@home[14] is a program to search for alien life by analyzing radio telescope signals using Fourier transform radio telescope data from telescopes from different sites.
Most of these efforts explicitly develop a docking  application as a parallel application using a special purpose parallel programming language and middleware, such as MPI, which requires development skills and effort.
