As enumerated in Section 4.2, EMT has a number of  limitations, such as difficulty in dealing with negative dynamic  preference.
Since EMT exhibits the key features of the general DBC  framework, as well as polynomial time complexity, we used the  multitarget version of EMT [15] to demonstrate that the class of area sweeping problems naturally lends itself to dynamics-based  descriptions, as instantiated by our experiments in the Tag Game  domain.
