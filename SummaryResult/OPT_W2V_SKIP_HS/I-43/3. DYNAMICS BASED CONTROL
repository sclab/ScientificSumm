â€¢ Agent Level in turn combines the environment model from the Environment Design level, the dynamics estimation  procedure, the deviation measure and the target dynamics  specification from User Level, to produce a sequence of actions that create system dynamics as close as possible to the  targeted specification.
3.2 DBC View of the State Space It is important to note the complementary view that DBC and POMDPs take on the state space of the environment.
For  example, this level would specify the laws of physics within the system, and set its parameters, such as the gravitation  constant.
Notice how DBC discards
