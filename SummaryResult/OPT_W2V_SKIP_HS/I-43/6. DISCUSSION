The design of the EMT solution for the Tag Game exposes the core difference in approach to planning and control between EMT or DBC, on the one hand, and the more familiar POMDP approach, on the other.
Thus for the Tag Game, we did not search for a reward function that would encode and express our preference over the agent"s  behavior, but rather directly set three (heuristic) behavior preferences as the basis for target dynamics to be maintained.
Experimental data shows that these targets need not be directly achievable via the agent"s actions.
