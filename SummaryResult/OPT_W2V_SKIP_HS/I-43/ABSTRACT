In this paper we introduce Dynamics Based Control (DBC), an approach to planning and control of an agent in stochastic  environments.
We show that a recently developed planning and control approach, Extended Markov Tracking (EMT) is an  instantiation of DBC.
EMT employs greedy action selection to  provide an efficient control algorithm in Markovian environments.
Unlike existing approaches, which seek to optimize  expected rewards (e.g., in Partially Observable Markov Decision  Problems (POMDPs)), DBC optimizes system behavior towards  specified system dynamics.
We show that such problems can be naturally  defined and efficiently solved using the DBC framework, and its EMT instantiation.
