In every run, the initial position of both the agent and its quarry was selected at random; this means that as far as the agent was concerned, the quarry"s initial position was uniformly distributed over the entire domain cell space.
The effects of an action taken by the agent are deterministic, but the environment in general has a stochastic response due to the  motion of the quarry.
In spite of a simple and inefficient Matlab implementation of the EMT algorithm, the decision time for any given step  averaged significantly below 1 second in all experiments.
