EMT-based control is based on the Markovian environment definition, as in the case with POMDPs, but its User and Agent Levels are of the Markovian DBC type of optimality.
The prediction is based on the environment model provided by the Environment Design level , so that if we denote by Ta the environment '' s transition function limited to action a , and pt−1 is the auxiliary Bayesian system state estimator , then the EMT-based control choice is described by a∗ = arg min a∈A DKL ( H [ Ta × pt , pt , τt EMT ] qEMT ×
