For sensor networks, we  assert that a centralized index for multi-dimensional range queries may not be feasible for energy-efficiency reasons (as well as the fact that the access bandwidth to this central index will be limited, particularly for queries emanating from within the network).
Finally, we note that DIMs are applicable not just to sensor networks, but to other deeply distributed systems (embedded networks for home and factory  automation) as well. 
DIMs are inspired by classical database  indices, and are essentially embeddings of such indices within the sensor network.
In detailed simulations , we show that in practice , the
