Unlike these approaches, in our work the data generated at a node are hashed (in general) to different  locations.
More recent work in the Internet context has addressed support for range queries in DHT systems [1, 12], but it is unclear if these directly translate to the sensor network context.
DIMENSIONS and DIFS can be thought of as using the same set of primitives as GHT (storage using consistent hashing), but for different ends: DIMENSIONS allows  drill64 down search for features within a sensor network, while DIFS allows range queries on a single key in addition to other operations.
