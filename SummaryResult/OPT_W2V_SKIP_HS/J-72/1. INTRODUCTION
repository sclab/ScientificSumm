In contrast, our work shows that given a more general (yet still quite standard) version of demand query than the type they consider, the complexity of preference elicitation is no greater than the complexity of learning.
Our focus is on the time and communication complexity of preference elicitation  regardless of incentive constraints, and on the relationship between the complexities of learning and preference elicitation.
The advantage of our scheme is that agents can be viewed as black-boxes that provide incremental information about their valuations.
Of course , a one-shot combinatorial auction where agents provide their entire valuation functions at once
