At the heart of this result is the fact that demand queries may be viewed as modified equivalence queries,  specialized to the problem of preference elicitation.
Our result allows us to apply the wealth of available learning algorithms to the problem of preference elicitation.
Finally, it would be useful to determine whether the ORâˆ— bidding language [11] can be efficiently learned (and hence elicited), given this language"s expressiveness and  succinctness for a wide variety of valuation classes.
This is the  preference elicitation problem.
We also plan to implement the algorithms for learning polynomials and XOR bids as elicitation
