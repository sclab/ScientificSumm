Similarly, the representation class C can be efficiently elicited from value and demand queries if the  algorithm L outputs an optimal allocation with communication p(size(v1, .
More formally , a representation class ( bidding language ) C is polynomially interpretable if there exists an algorithm that given as input some v ∈ C and an instance x ∈ X computes the value v ( x ) in time q ( size ( v ) , m ) , for some fixed polynomial q ( · , · ) .2 In the intermediate rounds of an ( iterative ) auction
