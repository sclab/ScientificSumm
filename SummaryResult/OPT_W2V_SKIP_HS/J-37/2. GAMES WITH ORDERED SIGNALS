A game with ordered signals Γ and an information filter F for Γ defines a new game ΓF .
(Information preservation) If two values of a signal are distinguishable in round k, then they are  distinguishable fpr each round j > k. Let mj = Pj l=1 κl +γl .
The private information  revealed to player i ∈ I in round j is βj i ∈ Θγj and the private information revaled to player i ∈ I in all rounds up through round j is ˜βj i = ` β1 i , .
8. ω : rS j=1 Zj → { over , continue } is a mapping
