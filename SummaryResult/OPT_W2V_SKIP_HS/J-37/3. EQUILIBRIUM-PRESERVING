Associated with every ordered game Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u and information filter F is a  filtered signal tree, a directed tree in which each node  corresponds to some revealed (filtered) signals and edges  correspond to revealing specific (filtered) signals.
Thus, we can uniquely specify this information set using the information  Fj  ˜α∗j , ˜β∗j i  , ˜z  .
Using μ , we will construct a belief system μ for Γ and show that conditions C1 and C2 hold, thus supporting σ as a Nash equilibrium.
For an extensive form game , a belief system μ assigns a probability
