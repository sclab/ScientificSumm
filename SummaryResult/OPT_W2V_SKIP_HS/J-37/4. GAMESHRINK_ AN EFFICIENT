In  general, if an ordered game has r rounds, and each round"s stage game has at least b nonterminal leaves, then the size of the signal tree is at most 1 br of the size of the game tree.
By evaluating this dynamic program from bottom to top, Algorithm 1 determines, in time polynomial in the size of the signal tree, whether or not any pair of equal depth nodes x and y are ordered game isomorphic.
The problem of computing the index in ( either ) one of the dimensions is exactly the problem of computing a
