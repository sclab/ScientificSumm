Also, for any feasible solution to the LP, we can get bounds on the quality of the strategies by examining the primal and dual solutions.
One problem with the simplex method is that it is not a primal-dual algorithm, that is, it does not maintain both  primal and dual feasibility throughout its execution.
For a two-player game, we can always evaluate the worst-case performance of a strategy, thus providing some objective evaluation of the strength of the strategy.
Some games are too large to compute an exact  equilibrium, even after using the presented abstraction technique.
Thus , with this threshold
