We chose a particular poker game as the benchmark problem because it yields an extremely  complicated and enormous game tree, it is a game of imperfect information, it is fully specified as a game (and the data is available), and it has been posted as a challenge problem by others [47] (to our knowledge no such challenge  problem instances have been proposed for electronic commerce applications that require solving sequential games).
Minimax search runs in linear time in the size of the game tree.2 The differentiating feature of games of imperfect information , such as poker , is that they
