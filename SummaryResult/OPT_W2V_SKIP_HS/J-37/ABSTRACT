Finding an equilibrium of an extensive form game of  imperfect information is a fundamental problem in computational game theory, but current techniques do not scale to large games.
We present an  algorithm, GameShrink, for abstracting the game using our isomorphism exhaustively.
For a multi-player sequential game of imperfect information with observable actions and an  ordered signal space, we prove that any Nash equilibrium in an abstracted smaller game, obtained by one or more  applications of the transformation, can be easily converted into a Nash equilibrium in the original game.
To address even larger games , we introduce approximation methods that
