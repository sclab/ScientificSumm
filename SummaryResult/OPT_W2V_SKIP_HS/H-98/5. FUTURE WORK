From the empirical evidence presented in [22], the expectation is that such a distribution might allow more emphasis of the probability mass around the modes (as with the exponential) while still providing more accurate estimates toward the tails.
Finally, extending these methods to the outputs of other  discriminative classifiers is an open area.
We are currently evaluating the appropriateness of these methods for the output of a voted  perceptron [11].
Just as logistic regression allows the log-odds of the posterior distribution to be fit directly with a line , we could directly fit the log-odds of the posterior with a
