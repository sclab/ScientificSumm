In order to find the MLEs, we have two choices: (1) use numerical estimation to estimate all three parameters at once (2) fix the value of θ, and estimate the other two (β and γ or σl and σr) given our choice of θ, then consider alternate values of θ.
Namely, if we have a raw output score that can be used for discrimination, then the empirical  behavior between the modes (label B in Figure 2) is often very different than that outside of the modes (labels A and C in Figure 2).
Then , we can simply consider all
