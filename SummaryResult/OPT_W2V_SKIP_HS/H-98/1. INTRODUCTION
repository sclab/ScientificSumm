Additionally, these models can be interpreted as assuming the scores produced by the text classifier have three basic types of empirical behavior - one corresponding to each of the extremely irrelevant, hard to discriminate, and obviously relevant items.
Text classifiers that give probability estimates are more flexible in practice than those that give only a simple classification or even a ranking.
However, in all of these tasks, the quality of the probability estimates is crucial.
While some of these methods allow the distributions of the documents relevant and irrelevant to the topic to have different variances , they typically enforce the
