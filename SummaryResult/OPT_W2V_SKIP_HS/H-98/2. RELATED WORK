In more recent work [27], they investigate using a semi-parametric method that uses a monotonic  piecewiseconstant fit to the data and apply the method to na¨ıve Bayes and a linear SVM.
Our work is similar in flavor to these previous attempts to model search engine scores, but we target text classifier outputs which we have found demonstrate a different type of score distribution  behavior because of the role of training data.
Parametric models have been employed to obtain probability  estimates in several areas of information retrieval.
There is a variety of other work that this paper extends.
