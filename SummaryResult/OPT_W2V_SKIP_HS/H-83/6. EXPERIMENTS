To provide some anecdotal evidence for the effectiveness of our page  selection methods, we note that the SC-Select method chose 11 pages within the www.educationnext.org domain, the PF-Select method discovered 7 such pages, while the  OutlinkCount and Random methods found only 6 pages each.
In contrast to the â€˜edu" local domains, the Random and OutlinkCount methods were not competitive with  either the SC-Select or the PF-Select methods.
Among all datasets and all node selection methods , the stochastic complementation method was most impressive in this dataset , realizing a final estimate that differed only .0279 from the global PageRank
