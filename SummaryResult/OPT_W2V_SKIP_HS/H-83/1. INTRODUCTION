In order to provide 116 Research Track Paper a good approximation to the global PageRanks, care must be taken when choosing which pages to crawl next; in this paper, we present a well-motivated page selection algorithm that also performs well empirically.
By restricting themselves to smaller, more manageable sections of the web, localized search engines can also provide more precise and complete search capabilities over their respective domains.
Finally, we empirically demonstrate that, given a local domain of size n, we can provide good approximations to the global PageRank values by crawling at most n or 2n additional pages.
Consequently
