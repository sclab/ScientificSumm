Whereas our framework seeks to minimize the difference between the global and local PageRank, the  objective used in [6] is to crawl the most highly (globally) ranked pages first.
also experiment within a similar crawling framework in [2], but quantify their results by comparing Kendall"s rank  correlation between the PageRanks of the current set of crawled pages and those of the entire global graph.
Many algorithmic improvements for computing exact  PageRank values have been proposed [9, 10, 14].
Gan , Chen , and Suel propose a method for estimating the PageRank of a single page [ 5 ]
