Without loss of generality, we will partition G as: G = L Gout Lout Gwithin , (2) where L is the n Ã— n local subgraph corresponding to links inside the local domain, Lout is the subgraph that  corresponds to links from the local domain pointing out to the global domain, Gout is the subgraph containing links from the global domain into the local domain, and Gwithin  contains links within the global domain.
Since the PageRanks are computed in each iteration of the algorithm , which is an O ( n ) operation , we will also assume that the number of
