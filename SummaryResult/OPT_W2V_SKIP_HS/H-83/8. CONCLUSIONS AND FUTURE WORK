In this work, we contend that the use of global PageRank in a localized search engine can improve performance.
The results of such a study can then be analyzed to determine the added benefit of using the global PageRanks computed by our methods, over just using the local PageRanks.
To determine the  benefit of using global PageRanks in a localized search engine, we suggest a user study in which users are asked to rate the quality of search results for various search queries.
One way to integrate these pages into our framework is to start the FindGlobalPR algorithm with the
