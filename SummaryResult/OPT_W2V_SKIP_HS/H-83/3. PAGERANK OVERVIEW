This method first chooses a random starting vector r(0) , and iteratively multiplies the current vector by the PageRank matrix PU ; see Algorithm 1.
We define the PageRank matrix PU to be: PU = αUD−1 U + (1 − α)veT , (1) where DU is the (unique) diagonal matrix such that UD−1 U is column stochastic, α is a given scalar such that 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, e is the vector of all ones, and v is a non-negative,  L1normalized vector, sometimes called the ‘random surfer"  vector.
Finally , the total space needed is also O ( km ) ,
