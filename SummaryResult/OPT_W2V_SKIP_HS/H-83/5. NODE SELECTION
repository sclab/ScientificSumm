Specifically, the addition of page k does not change the PageRanks of the pages in F , and thus fk = f. By construction of the stochastic complement, fk = Sfk, so the approximation given in equation (11) will yield the exact solution.
(18) The first term x is a sparse vector, and takes non-zero values only for local pages k that are siblings of the global page j.
The L1NormDiff method is called on the components of these vectors which correspond to the pages in L , and it estimates the value of EL ( y + ( ËœuT j f )
