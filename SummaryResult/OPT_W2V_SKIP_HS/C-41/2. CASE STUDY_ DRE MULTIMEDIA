In contrast, we treat QoS  requirements such as video frame rate and picture resolution as softer QoS requirements and modify these video properties adaptively to handle dynamic changes in resource  availabil2 Although hard and soft are often portrayed as two discrete requirement sets, in practice they are usually two ends of a continuum ranging from softer to harder rather than two disjoint points.
Effective resource utilization is the desired system condition since it ensures that end-to-end QoS requirements of the UAV-based multimedia system are met and utilization of both system resources , i.e. , network bandwidth and computational power ,
