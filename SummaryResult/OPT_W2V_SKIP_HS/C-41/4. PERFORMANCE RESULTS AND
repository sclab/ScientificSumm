Figure 4 shows that HyARM maintains system utilization close to the desired utilization set point during fluctuation in  input work load by transmitting video of higher (or lower) QoS for QoS-enabled (or best-effort) class of applications during over (or under) utilization of system resources.
To evaluate the QoS provided by HyARM, we monitored CPU utilization at the two UAVs, and network bandwidth utilization between the UAV and the base station.
We also used application QoS as a metric to evaluate HyARM '' s capabilities to support end-to-end QoS requirements of the various classes of applications in the DRE multimedia system
