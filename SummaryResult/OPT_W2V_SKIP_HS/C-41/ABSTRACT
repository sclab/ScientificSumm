A challenging problem faced by researchers and developers of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems is  devising and implementing effective adaptive resource  management strategies that can meet end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements in varying operational conditions.
First, we describe the structure and functionality of the Hybrid Adaptive  Resourcemanagement Middleware (HyARM), which provides  adaptive resource management using hybrid control techniques for adapting to workload fluctuations and resource  availability.
Second, we evaluate the adaptive behavior of HyARM via experiments on a DRE multimedia system that distributes video in real-time.
This paper presents two contributions to research in adaptive resource management for
