Application adapter(s), that are collocated with the application, modify the input parameters to the  application - in our case video encoder - to modify the application resource utilization and QoS.
Figure 3 shows the interaction of various parts of the DRE multimedia system developed with HyARM, TAO, and TAO"s A/V Streaming Service.
The central controller maintains the system resource utilization below a desired bound by (1) processing periodic updates it receives from resource monitors and (2)  modifying the execution of applications accordingly, e.g., by  using different execution algorithms or operating the  application with increased/decreased QoS.
