Although existing FCS algorithms have shown promise, these algorithms often assume that the system has continuous control variable(s) that can continuously be adjusted.
HyARM can therefore be applied to system that support continuous and/or discrete set of control variables.
These variables are modified by HyARM to achieve efficient resource utilization and improved  application QoS. 
The DRE multimedia system as described in Section 2 is an example DRE system that offers both  continuous (picture resolution) and discrete set (frame-rate) of control variables.
These techniques aid in overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly
