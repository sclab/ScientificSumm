The local decisions (1 for target present and 0 otherwise) from the sensors are totaled at a sensor and the sum is  compared to another threshold to arrive at the consensus  decision.
A target traversing the sensor field using path P is detected if it is detected at some point u âˆˆ P. The exposure of path P is the net probability of detecting a target that traverses the field using P. The target is assumed to be able to follow any path through the field and the problem is to find the path P with the least exposure.
Therefore
