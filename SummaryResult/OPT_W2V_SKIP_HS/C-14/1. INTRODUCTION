The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target  detection in a region of interest.
In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random which corresponds to many practical applications where the region to be monitored is not accessible for precise  placement of sensors.
This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor networks performing target detection over a region of  interest.
An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4 and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in section 6 to determine the optimum solution for
