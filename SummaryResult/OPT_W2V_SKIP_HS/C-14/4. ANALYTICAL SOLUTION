For the proposed solution, we assume that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the minimum exposure ed is not reached.
To evaluate the  probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor deployment, we make the following approximation: the  distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the  exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
If the desired exposure is obtained after the first step , the cost of deployment is Cd + n1Cs , and this
