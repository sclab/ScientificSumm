We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to  deployment and sensors.
A  mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths through the region.
The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment.
In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in steps is developed.
These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment
