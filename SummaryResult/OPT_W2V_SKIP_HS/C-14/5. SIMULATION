For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure.
As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases.
The confidence for ed when  deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the  distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 
The region monitored is of size 20Ã—20 with a noise ( AWGN ) of variance 1 , so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when
