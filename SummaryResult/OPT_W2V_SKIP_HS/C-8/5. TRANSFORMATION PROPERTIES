4 There is another Inverse Property 1 (IP1) that is required in an OT system for achieving the correct undo effect [21], but IP1 is not related to IT functions.
284 There are generally two ways to achieve OT correctness with respect to these transformation properties: one is to design transformation functions capable of preserving these properties; the other is to design control algorithms capable of breaking the pre-conditions for requiring these properties.
PC-IP2 : IP2 is required only if the OT system allows an operation Ox to be transformed against a pair of do and undo operations ( O
