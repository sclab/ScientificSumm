They are insufficient because an OT system may need to preserve additional properties/conditions, such as IP2, IP3, and those summarized in [21].
COT is simpler than GOTO-ANYUNDO (and prior OT algorithms based on the causality theory) because of the use of a single theory of operation context for capturing all  OTrelated conditions (CC1-CC6), the uniformity of  contextbased conditions for treating all types of operation, and the conciseness of these context-based conditions.
In our view, the false-tie problem is an issue at the transformation function level and its solution could and should be localized at this level as well.
