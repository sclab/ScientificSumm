In this paper, we report the main results of this effort: the theory of operation  context and the COT (Context-based OT) algorithm.
The dOPT algorithm was the first OT algorithm and was based solely on the concurrency relationships among operations [4]: a pair of operations are transformable as long as they are  concurrent.
After having designed , implemented , and experimented with a series of OT algorithms of increased complexity , we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a uniformed theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems , reducing its complexity , and
