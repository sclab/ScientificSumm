The heart of COT-DO is transform(O, CD), whose task is to transform O against operations in CD, which represents the context difference between C(O) and a new context on which O is to be defined.
In Step 2, it must be that C(O) = DS (CC3), so O is executed as-is, and the original of O is added to DS (according to Definition 3-Item 2).
Then, COT-DO is invoked with parameters O2 and DS.
C(O1) = {O2}, which is the key step in detecting the dOPT-puzzle.
This is to  upgrade the context of O to DS.
C (
