When O is an original  normal operation, all operations which are causally before O must be included in C(O) (according to Definition 1 and Definition 5), so CC1 preserves the causal  ordering among original normal operations [4, 22].
﻿3.1 Basic concept Conceptually, each operation O is associated with a  context, denoted by C(O), which corresponds to the document 280 state on which the operation is defined.
To achieve the undo effect in [ 21 ] , an original inverse operation O should be defined on the document state DS = C ( O ) ∪ { O }
