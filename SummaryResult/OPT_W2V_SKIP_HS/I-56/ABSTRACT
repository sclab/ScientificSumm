By anchoring the DCSP search on automated negotiation, we show that several well-known DCSP algorithms are actually mechanisms that can reach agreements through a common Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) protocol, but using different strategies.
A major motivation for this BDI  framework is that it not only provides a conceptually clearer  understanding of existing DCSP algorithms from an agent model  perspective, but also opens up the opportunities to extend and  develop new strategies for DCSP.
The Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem ( DCSP ) is one that entails several agents to search for an agreement , which is a consistent combination of actions that
