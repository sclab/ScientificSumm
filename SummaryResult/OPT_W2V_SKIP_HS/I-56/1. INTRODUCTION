Therefore, in  cooperatively searching for a DCSP solution, the agents would need to communicate with one another, and adjust and re-adjust their own variable assignments in the process.
As with an agent, a constraint can also be associated with a priority value.
The search can be realized via a negotiation mechanism (or algorithm) by which the agents follow a high level protocol prescribing the rules of interactions, using a set of strategies devised to select their own preferences at each negotiation step.
In order to engage in cooperative behavior , a DCSP agent needs five fundamental parameters , namely ,
