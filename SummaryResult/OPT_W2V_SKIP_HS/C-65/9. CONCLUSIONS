The system proved to be very robust when increasing the node location and orientation errors and decreasing the number of available sensors all the way down to a couple.
Experiments with a previous  generation sensor board indicated that this could provide a 10x increase in battery life.
We believe that with the lessons learned in the test, a consecutive field experiment could have showed significantly improved results especially in range estimation beyond 100 m and weapon classification for the remaining two weapons that were mistaken for each other the majority of the times during the test.
While the overall localization
