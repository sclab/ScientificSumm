Note that almost all of these shots were still accurately localized by the networked system, i.e.
The  percentages are relative to the number of shots localized and not all shots, as the classification algorithm needs to know the trajectory and the range.
There are several disadvantages of the single sensor case compared to the  networked system: there is no redundancy to compensate for other errors and to perform outlier rejection, the  localization rate is markedly lower, and a single sensor alone is not able to estimate the caliber or classify the weapon.
Since all the sensors were in approximately a
