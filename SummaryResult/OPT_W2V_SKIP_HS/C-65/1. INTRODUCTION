As it is primarily the soldiers that the system protects, a natural extension is to mount the sensors on the soldiers themselves.
As soldiers may work in groups of as little as four people, the number of sensors measuring the acoustic phenomena may be an order of magnitude smaller than before.
This capability is due to the widely distributed sensing and the unique sensor fusion approach [8].
PinPtr is characterized by high precision : 1m average 3D accuracy for shots originating within or near the sensor network and 1 degree bearing precision for both azimuth and elevation and 10 %
