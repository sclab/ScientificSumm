Mays  concludes that the DWT is the best method for classifying  signals as either shockwaves or muzzle blasts because it works well and is less expensive to compute than the SPWVD [10].
The problem with this and similar centralized  systems is the need of the one or handful of microphone arrays to be in line-of-sight of the shooter.
A sensor networked based solution has the advantage of widely distributed  sensing for better coverage, multipath effect compensation and multiple simultaneous shot resolution [8].
The edges of the shockwave are typically well defined and the shockwave length is directly related to the
