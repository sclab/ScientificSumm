The shockwave has a characteristic shape resembling a capital N. The rise time at both the start and end of the signal is very fast, under 1 Î¼sec.
A hybrid sensor fusion algorithm then estimates the trajectory, the range, the caliber and the weapon type based on all available observations.
The firing of a typical military rifle, such as the AK47 or M16, produces two distinct acoustic phenomena.
Also, this method does not estimate a trajectory.
The muzzle blast is generated at the muzzle of the gun and  travels at the speed sound.
However , the sensorboards are also connected
