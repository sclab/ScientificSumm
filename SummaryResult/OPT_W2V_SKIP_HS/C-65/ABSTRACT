A sensor node consists of a  helmetmounted microphone array, a COTS MICAz mote for  internode communication and a custom sensorboard that  implements the acoustic detection and Time of Arrival (ToA)  estimation algorithms on an FPGA.
A 3-axis compass provides self orientation and Bluetooth is used for communication with the soldier"s PDA running the data fusion and the user interface.
The heterogeneous sensor fusion algorithm can work with data from a single sensor or it can fuse ToA or Angle of Arrival (AoA) observations of muzzle blasts and ballistic shockwaves from multiple sensors.
The paper presents the system design
