For each sensor, we considered the shockwave length estimation valid if at least three out of four microphones agreed on a value with at most 5 microsecond variance.
Since it is a box and not a single point, this gives us an interval for the shot time.
To avoid this error sensitivity problem, we consider shockwave  measurement pairs only if the direction of arrival difference is larger than a certain threshold.
Some sensors report only ToA , some has bearing estimate ( s ) also and some has range estimate ( s ) as well , depending on the number
