If f < m, then Γ achieves a value of at most lf +δ (the value of job f if it were perturbed), while Γoffline achieves a value of at least k·( f h=1 lh −2δ)+lf+1 +lf by executing minor jobs until rf+1, followed by job f +1 and then job f (we subtract two δ"s instead of one because the last minor job before rf+1 may have to be abandoned).
No major job is released after job m. In order to achieve the desired competitive ratio , Γ must complete some major job f , because Γoffline
