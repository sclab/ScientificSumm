The only other paper we are aware of that addresses the issue of incentive compatibility in a real-time system is [11], which considers several variants of a model in which the center allocates bandwidth to agents who declare both their value and their arrival time.
In [2], a  general method is presented for converting an online algorithm into an online mechanism that is incentive compatible with respect to values.
For a survey of this and other topics in distributed algorithmic mechanism design, see [9].
This paper also launched the area of algorithmic mechanism design , in which the mechanism must
