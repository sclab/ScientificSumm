The setting addressed by these papers is completely  nonstrategic, and the algorithm is assumed to always know the true characteristics of each job upon its release.
Two papers paint a complete picture in terms of  competitive analysis for this setting, in which the algorithm is assumed to know k, the maximum ratio between the value densities (value divided by processing time) of any two jobs.
A basic solution concept of mechanism design is incentive compatibility , which , in our setting , requires that it is always in each agent '' s best interests to immediately submit its job upon
