Similar prediction accuracy on the GOV2 collection using another technique is reported in [2], confirming the difficult of predicting query performance on a large web collection.
Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.
Current prediction models devised for content-based queries will be less effective for NP queries considering the fundamental differences between the two.
For instance, we may need to incorporate a query classifier into prediction models.
In fact , according to the report on the NP
