In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).
We believe that this is the main reason for the low accuracy of the clarity score on the second data set.
We divide the queries in the pool into classes: good (better than 50% of the queries of the same type in terms of retrieval performance) and bad (otherwise).
We find that the robustness score , though originally proposed
