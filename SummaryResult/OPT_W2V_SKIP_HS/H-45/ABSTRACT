We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding.
Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.
Consequently, our paper provides a practical approach to performance prediction in  realworld web settings.
In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately , we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types
