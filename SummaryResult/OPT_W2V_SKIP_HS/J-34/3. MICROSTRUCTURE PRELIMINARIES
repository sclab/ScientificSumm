Now regardless the state that we were in, b1 is still only in one buy book (but with a different price), and thus we remain in the same state in S. The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows from the above lemmas. 
Shortly we show that if we change only one order"s value (price), we remain in this set for any sequence of limit orders.
For the case when the order appears only in one set of books, without loss of generality we assume that the cancellation cancels a buy order at b1.
If the current order book state
