• If Ai cannot generate any counterargument or  counterexample, the token is sent to the next agent, a new round t + 1 starts, and the protocol moves to state 2.
The agent Aj that has received the counterexample c retains it into its case base and generates a new argument αt+1 j that takes into account c, and informs the rest of the agents by sending assert(αt+1 j ) to all of them.
• If βt i is a counterargument , then , Ai locally compares αt i with βt i by assessing their confidence against its individual case
