Figure 6 contains three plots, where NL (not learning) shows accuracy of an agent with no learning at all; L (learning), shows the evolution of the individual classification accuracy when agents learn by retaining the training cases they individually  receive (notice that when all the training cases have been retained at 100%, the accuracy should be equal to that of Figure 5 for  individual agents); and finally LFC (learning from communication) shows the evolution of the individual classification accuracy of learning agents that also learn by retaining those counterexamples received during argumentation (i.e.
For instance , the joint accuracy for
