A justification built by a CBR method after determining that the solution of a particular problem P was Sk is a description that contains the relevant information from the problem P that the CBR method has considered to predict Sk as the solution of P. In particular , CBR methods work by retrieving similar cases to the problem at hand , and then reusing their solutions for the current problem , expecting that
