Specifically, we have presented AMAL, a framework that allows a group of learning agents to  argue about the solution of a given problem and we have shown how the learning capabilities can be used to generate arguments and counterarguments.
Finally, in the experiments presented here a learning agent would retain all counterexamples submitted by the other agent; however, this is a very simple case retention policy, and we will like to  experiment with more informed policies - with the goal that individual learning agents could significantly improve using only a small set of cases proposed by other agents.
