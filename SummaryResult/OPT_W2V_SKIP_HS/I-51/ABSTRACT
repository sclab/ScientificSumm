For learning from  communication, an agent engages into arguing with other agents in  order to contrast its individual hypotheses and receive  counterexamples; the argumentation process improves their learning scope and individual performance.

We experimentally show that the argumentation among committees of agents improves both the individual and joint performance.
For join deliberation, learning agents share their experience by forming a committee to decide upon some joint decision.
The AMAL framework is completely based
