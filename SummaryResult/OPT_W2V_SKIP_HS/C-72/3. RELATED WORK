As mentioned earlier, the FCC has already identified new regimes for spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users and a variety of systems have been proposed in the literature to support such sharing [4, 17].
[11] consider a centralized access point (or base station) architecture in which  sensing information is forwarded to APs for spectrum allocation purposes.
More recently, some researchers have proposed approaches for radio coordination.
This has been shown by Sahai et al.
Research in cognitive radio has increased rapidly [ 4 , 17 ] over the years , and it is being projected as one of
