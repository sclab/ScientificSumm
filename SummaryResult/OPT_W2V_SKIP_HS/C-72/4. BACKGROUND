This  aggregate is then communicated to other nodes in the  network and this process repeats until the aggregate at all nodes has converged to the same value, i.e.
More accurate aggregates can be computed by maintaining multiple bit vectors at each node, as explained in [7].
Although such aggregates are very compact in nature,  requiring only O(logN) state space (where N is the number of nodes), they may not be very accurate as they can only approximate values to the closest power of 2, potentially causing errors of up to 50%.
Gossip protocols have been shown to provide exponentially
