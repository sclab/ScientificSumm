However, such coordination is non-trivial due to: (1) the limited bandwidth available for coordination, (2) the need to communicate this information on short timescales, and (3) the large amount of sensory data that needs to be exchanged.
Coordination which does not support rapid dissemination of information will not be able to account for such RF variations.
As we show in Section 7, 1 Convergence time is correlated with the connectivity topology of the devices, which in turn depends on the environment.
Exchanging this information among even a small group of 50 devices each second would require ( 50 time-steps Ã—
