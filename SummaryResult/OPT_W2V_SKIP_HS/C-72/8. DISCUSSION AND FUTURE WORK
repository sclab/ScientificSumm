One challenge with this approach is that propagation distance cannot be determined ahead of time and more importantly, exhibits spatio-temporal variations.
The trade-offs of different approaches to implementing GUESS is a subject of future work. 
Weighted Readings: Although we argued that most devices will likely be equipped with low-cost sensing  equipment, there may be situations where there are some special infrastructure nodes that have better sensing abilities than others.
As well, we also require the use of a control channel to disseminate sensing  information.
Therefore , we recommend the use of spatially decaying aggregates [ 6 ] , which
