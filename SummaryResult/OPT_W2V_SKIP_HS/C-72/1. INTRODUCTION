These algorithms are well suited to coordinated spectrum sensing due to the unique characteristics of the problem: i.e.
In this paper, we propose strategies for coordinated spectrum sensing that are low cost, operate on timescales comparable to the agility of the RF environment, and are resilient to network failures and alterations.
Section 2 motivates the need for a low cost and efficient approach to coordinated spectrum sensing.
Approximate summaries are sufficient for coordination: Approximate statistical summaries of sensed data are sufficient for correlating sensed information between radios, as relative usage information is more  important than absolute usage data.
