These improvements carry over to a PLRG topology as well (as shown in Figure 4(c)), where IRWP is 1.33 times faster than random walk.
Finally, in order to isolate the effect of protocol  operation on performance, we do not model the complexities of the wireless channel in our simulations.
A run ends when the new average signal level has converged in the network.
Although random walk and IRWP both use k random walks (in our simulations k = number of nodes), IRWP initiates walks only from  updated nodes (as explained in Section 5.2), resulting in faster information convergence.
We use
