The agent is then recommended to improve of coalition C for which ωC (Hk, x) is maximum.
The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , .
All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the  introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].
In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts  substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].
Hk on some criteria C ⊆ Nk as follows ωC ( Hk , x
