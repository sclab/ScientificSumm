Interestingly, one of these forms is degenerate with respect to one of the players; that is, it can be described as a mechanism with k − 1 actions for this player.
A corollary from the proof of Theorem 1 is that the optimal 2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the players has only k − 1 different actions).
The rightmost table show an example for a diagonal allocation scheme where one of the player has only k − 1 possible actions.
For optimizing the expected social
