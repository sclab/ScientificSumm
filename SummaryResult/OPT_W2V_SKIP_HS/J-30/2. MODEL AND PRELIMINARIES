Note that the definition above requires that g will be  single crossing with respect to every player i, given her  individual order i on the alternatives.
That is, the social value function g will be compatible in this sense with the  singlecrossing conditions on the players" preferences.
A player"s valuation function will be single-crossing if the effect of an increment in the player"s type on the player"s valuation for 2 We will show that, w.l.o.g., we can focus on deterministic allocation schemes.
When the action space is discrete , the order can be
