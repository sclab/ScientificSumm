For proving that the  informationtheoretically optimal result is achieved with threshold  strategies, it is sufficient to show that the social-choice function exhibits a single-crossing condition on expectation: given any allocation scheme, and fixing the behavior of the other players, the expected social value in any two actions (as a function of Î¸i) is single crossing.
Therefore, an immediate conclusion from Theorem 1 is that the  optimal social welfare, which is achievable with k actions, is implementable when the valuations are linear.
The basic intuition for the proof is that even for this general framework , we can construct mechanisms where
