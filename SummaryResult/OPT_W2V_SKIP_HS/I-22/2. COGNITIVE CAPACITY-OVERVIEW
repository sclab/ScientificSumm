Although physiological measures are sometimes highly  sensitive for tracking fluctuating levels of cognitive load, costs and work place conditions often favor task- and  performancebased techniques, which involve the measure of a secondary task as well as the primary task under consideration.
Hence, the allocation of the limited cognitive resources has to be balanced in  order to enhance human performance.
It seems that the notation of instantaneous load , which represents the dynamics of cognitive load over time , is especially useful for monitoring the fluctuation trend so that free capacity can be exploited at the most appropriate time to enhance
