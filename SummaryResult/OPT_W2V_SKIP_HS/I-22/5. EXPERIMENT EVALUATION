To get insights on how load predictions and multi-party communication may affect the performance of forming SMM, we designed 3 Agent teams (TA1, TA2, TA3) and 3 HAP teams (TH1, TH2, TH3), where all agents adopt the strategy in Table 1 to send and process information.
When sharing information , teams of type 1 ( TA1 , TH1 ) ignore load predictions ; teams of type 2 ( TA2 , TH2 ) consider load predictions ; teams of type 3 ( TA3 , TH3 ) follow load predictions more strictly in the sense that the agents will further group the
