In particular, we argue that to favor  humanagent collaboration, an agent system should be designed to allow the estimation and prediction of human teammates" (relative) cognitive loads, and use that to offer improvised, unintrusive help.
Humans and autonomous systems (agents) are generally thought to be  complementary: while humans are limited by their cognitive capacity in information processing, they are superior in spatial,  heuristic, and analogical reasoning; autonomous systems can  continuously learn expertise and tacit problem-solving  knowledge from humans to improve system performance.
Therefore , there is a clear demand for investigations to broaden and deepen our understanding on the
