In this paper, we consider the problem of managing and executing schedules in an uncertain and distributed environment as defined by the DARPA  Coordinators program.
In the following sections, we  describe the components of the architecture in more detail, considering in turn issues relating to executing agent  schedules, incrementally revising agent schedules and  coordinating schedule changes among multiple agents.
Such factors as geographical separation of executing agents , limitations on communication bandwidth , constraints relating to chain of command and the high tempo of execution dynamics may all preclude any single agent from obtaining a complete global view of the
