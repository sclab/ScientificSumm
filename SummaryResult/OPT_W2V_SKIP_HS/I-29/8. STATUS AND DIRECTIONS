Our current research efforts are aimed at extending the  capabilities of the Year 1 agent and scaling up to significantly larger problems.
In addition to verifying that the performance on Year 1  problems is matched or exceeded, we have recently run some successful tests with the agent on a few 100 agent problems.
To fully address various scale up issues, we are  investigating a number of more advanced coordination mechanisms.
To provide more global perspective to local scheduling  decisions, we are introducing mechanisms for computing,  communicating and using estimates of the non-local impact of remote nodes.
To better address the
