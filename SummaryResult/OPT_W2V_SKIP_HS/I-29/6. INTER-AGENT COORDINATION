When found, a non-local option is used by a  coordinating agent to formulate queries to any other involved agents in order to determine the impact of such constraint relaxations on their local schedules.
In many cases,  however, a larger-scoped change to the schedules of two or more agents can produce a higher-quality response.
If successful, a non-local option is generated, specifying the value of the new, higher quality local schedule, the temporal constraints on the local target activity, and the set of must-schedule enabler activities that must be scheduled by remote agents in order to achieve this local quality.
