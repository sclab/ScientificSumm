Then, as time permits, the core local problem solving infra-structure is used to drive an inter-agent option generation and query process, aimed at identifying  opportunities for solution improvement through joint change.
We describe an agent architecture for solving this problem that couples two basic mechanisms: (1) a flexible times representation of the agent"s schedule (using a Simple Temporal Network) and (2) an incremental rescheduling procedure.
We assume a team of  collaborative agents, each responsible for executing a portion of a globally pre-established schedule, but none possessing a global view of either the problem or solution.
We consider the
