The quality propagator analyzes the activity hierarchy and collects a set of methods that (if scheduled) would maximize the quality of the agent"s local problem.
As new methods are inserted into a schedule or  external state updates require adjustments to existing constraints (e.g., substitution of an actual duration constraint,  tightening of a deadline), the network propagates constraints and maintains lower and upper bounds on all time points in the network.
Since an and task accumulates quality only if all its children are scheduled , this biases the scheduling process towards failing early ( and regenerating contributors ) when
