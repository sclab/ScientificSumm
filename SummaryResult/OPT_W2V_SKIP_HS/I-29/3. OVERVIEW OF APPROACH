In its most basic form, an agent comprises four principal components - an Executor, a Scheduler, a Distributed State Manager (DSM), and an  Options Manager - all of which share a common model of the current problem and solution state that couples a  domainlevel representation of the subjective c taems task structure to an underlying STN.
First is the use of a STN-based flexible times  representation of solution constraints, which allows execution to be driven by a set of schedules rather than a single point solution.
This provides a basic hedge against temporal uncertainty and can be used to modulate the need
