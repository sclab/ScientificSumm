a may also inherit these constraints from ancestor tasks at any higher level in the task structure, and its effective execution window will be defined by the tightest of these constraints.
Methods appear at the leaf level of C TAEMS task structures and are those that are directly executable in the world.
As execution proceeds , agents must react to unexpected results ( e.g. , task delays , failures ) and changes to the mission ( e.g. , new tasks , deadline changes ) generated by the simulator , recognize when scheduled tasks are no longer feasible or desirable ,
