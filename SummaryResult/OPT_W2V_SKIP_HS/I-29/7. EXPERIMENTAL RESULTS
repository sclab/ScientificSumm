These classes,  summarized in Table 1, were designed to evaluate key aspects of a set of Coordinators distributed scheduling agents, such as their ability to handle unexpected execution results, chains of nle"s involving multiple agents, and effective scheduling of new activities that arise unexpectedly at some point  during the problem run.
Only simple tactics were adopted to explicitly address such uncertainty, such as the use of expected durations and quality for activities and a policy of excluding from consideration those activities with failure likelihood of >75%.
These results are particularly notable given that each agent '' s STN-based
