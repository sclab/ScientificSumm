The confidence estimates are rather low overall; that is because we have built a test collection from only two initial systems.
The distribution of confidence scores shows that at least 80% confidence is achieved more than 35% of the time, indicating that neither algorithm is being too conservative in its confidence estimates.
The results in Table 5 show everything about each set, including binned accuracy, W, mean Ï„, and median number of judgments to reach 95% confidence on the first two systems.
We calculated this for all pairs, then looked at  performance on pairs with low similarity.
Overfitting is difficult
