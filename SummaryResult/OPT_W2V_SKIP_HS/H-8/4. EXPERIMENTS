Finally, for our hypothesis that RTC is more accurate than MTC, we will look at Kendall"s Ï„ correlation between a ranking of k systems by a small set of judgments and the true ranking using the full set of judgments.
To put our method to the test, we selected c = 2: we will build a set of judgments from evaluating only two initial systems.
We can also use a paired t-test to test for a difference in mean.
4.4 Experimental Evaluation Recall that a set of judgments is robust if the accuracy of the predictions it makes is
