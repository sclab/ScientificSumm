For the confidence estimates to be  accurate, we need at least α · |Zα| of these pairs to actually have ΔMAP = −1 after we have judged every document.
We argue that the best possible distribution of relevance p(Xi) is the one that explains all of the data (all of the observations made about the retrieval systems) while at the same time making no unwarranted assumptions.
In our previous work, we defined confidence as the  probability that the difference in an evaluation measure calculated for two systems is less than zero [8].
By that we mean that if we have
