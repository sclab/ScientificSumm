In this work, we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments.
Low-cost methods for acquiring relevance judgments can be a boon to researchers who need to evaluate new retrieval tasks or topics but do not have the resources to make  thousands of judgments.
Using this method practically guarantees reusability: with as few as five judgments per topic taken from only two systems, we can reliably  evaluate a larger set of ten systems.
While these judgments are very useful
