In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of  calculating the Banzhaf power index within a particular multiagent  domain, a network flow game.
The relative power of each edge/agent reflects its significance in enabling such a flow, and in real-world networks could be used, for example, to allocate resources for maintaining parts of the network.
We also show that for some restricted network flow domains there exists a polynomial algorithm to calculate agents" Banzhaf power indices.
The Banzhaf power index is one of the most popular; it is also well-defined for any simple coalitional game.
We show that calculating
