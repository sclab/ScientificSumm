In all of this section, we take the input to the #MATCHING problem to be G =< U, V, E > with |U| = |V | = k, the network flow graph constructed in the reduction to be G =< V , E > with capacities c : E â†’ R as defined in Section 4.3, the edge for which to  calculate the Banzhaf index to be ef , and target flow values of k and k + .
If Ec fails to match a vertex in V ( the right side of the partition ) , the maximal possible flow that Ec allows in G is less than k. If it
