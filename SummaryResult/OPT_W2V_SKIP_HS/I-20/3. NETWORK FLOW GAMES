In such a scenario, the goal of a coalition is to have at least one path from s to t: v(C) = 1 if EC contains a path from s to t; 0 otherwise; Given a network flow game (or a connectivity game), we can compute the power indices of the game.
Given a coalition C , which controls the edges EC = { ei|i âˆˆ C } , we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins
