The Shapley-Shubik index [19] is the direct application of the Shapley value to simple coalitional games.
Since the Shapley value of any simple game has the same value as its Shapley-Shubik index, this shows that  calculating the Shapley-Shubik index in weighted majority games is  #Pcomplete.
However, they  introduced a non-simple game, where the value a coalition of agents achieves is the maximal total flow.
In his seminal paper, Shapley [18] considered coalitional games and the fair allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition (the coalition of all agents) to its members.
In this paper , we have considered
