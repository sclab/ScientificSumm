Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows (up to 1000 in our experiments), we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to  measure the results with different metrics.
Figure 10 is the percentage of accessed service providers (that is, the percentage of service providers represented in Figure 9) that had more assigned business processes than their advertised maximum concurrency.
This algorithm represents a naive  approach based on greedy, local observations of each workflow without taking into consideration all workflows.
As expected , the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because
