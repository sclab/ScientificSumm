So according to the theorem 1, we can know that nodes A, I1,…,It-1, B form a correct key path between node A and B.
If any two neighboring nodes in the nodes series A, I1,…,It-1, B can communicate directly, then node A can establish indirect pairwise key with node B through those t-1 intermediate nodes.
According to theorem 1 , we present the detailed description of the direct pairwise key discovery algorithm as follows : Step 1 : Obtain the node IDs and cluster IDs of the source node A and destination node B ; Step
