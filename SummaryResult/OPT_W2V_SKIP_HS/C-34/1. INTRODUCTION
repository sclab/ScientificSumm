In this paper, we present a kind of new cluster-based distribution model of sensor networks, and for which, we propose a new pairwise key pre-distribution scheme.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Combining the deployment knowledge of sensor networks and the polynomial pool-based key pre-distribution, we setup a  clusterbased topology that is practical with the real deployment of sensor networks.
All of those schemes above improve the security over the basic probabilistic key pre-distribution scheme.
The key contribution is that our scheme dose not require the assumption of all nodes can directly communicate with each other as
