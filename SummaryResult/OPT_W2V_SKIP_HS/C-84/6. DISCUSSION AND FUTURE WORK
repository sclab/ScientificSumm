Another  observation we made was that the number of replicas in a Nash  equilibrium can be more than the number of replicas in the social  optimum even without payments.
In our analyses, we assume that all nodes have the same demand.
We want to investigate whether there are certain distance constraints that guarantee O(1) price of anarchy.
As studied in [12], one way to formulate this problem is to find the best response of a server by solving a knapsack problem and to compute Nash equilibria.
However , if we aggregate n âˆ’ 1 nodes into one node with
