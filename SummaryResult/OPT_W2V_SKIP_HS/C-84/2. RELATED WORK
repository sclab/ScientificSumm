Our caching game is different from all of these in that the optimization process is performed among distributed selfish servers.
Douceur and Wattenhofer describe a hill-climbing algorithm to  exchange replicas for reliability in FARSITE [8].
Their results are not  directly applicable to our problem, however, because we consider each server to be tied to a particular location, while in their model an agent is able to open facilities in multiple locations.
Cost sharing in the facility location problem has been studied using cooperative game theory [7, 13, 29].
