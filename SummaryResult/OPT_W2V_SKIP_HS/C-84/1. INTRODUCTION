It has been an open question whether these caching scenarios and protocols maintain their desirable global properties (low total social cost, for example) in the face of selfish behavior.
â€¢ If pure strategy Nash equilibria do exist, how efficient are they (in terms of the price of anarchy, or its optimistic  counterpart) under different placement costs, network topologies, and demand distributions?
The price of anarchy bounds the worst possible behavior of a selfish system, when left completely on its own.
We also define a more elaborate payment model , in which each server bids for having an object replicated at
