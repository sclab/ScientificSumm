We observe in Figure 5 that more replicas are placed with payments than without when Î± is between 0.7 and 1.3, the only range of significant undersupply in the power-law case.
This can be explained by the observation in Figure 5(a) that there is no significant undersupply problem here like there was in the transit-stub graph.
As p decreases, the number of replicas placed in the social optimum decreases, but the number in Nash equilibria changes little.
The details of the simulations including protocols and a discussion of convergence are presented in Appendix C. In our evaluation , we
