dkj < α (5) The first condition guarantees that there is a server that places the replica within distance α of each server i.
In this analysis we use simply α in place of αij , since we deal with a single object and we assume placement cost is the same for all servers.
Network (c) shows a Nash equilibrium in the payment game, where two replicas, one for each cluster, are placed.
The placement cost can be further divided into first-time installation cost and maintenance cost : αij = k1i + k2i UpdateSizej ObjectSizej 1 T Pj k wkj , (
