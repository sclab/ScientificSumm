This paper presents the first investigation on utility-based information distillation with a system that learns the  longlasting information needs from fine-grained user feedback over a sequence of ranked passages.
We also proposed an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a weighted combination of relevance and novelty.
We developed a new scheme for automated evaluation and feedback based on a semi-automatic  procedure for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.
Our system, called CAFÂ´E, combines adaptive filtering, novelty detection and  antiredundant passage ranking in a unified framework for utility optimization.
