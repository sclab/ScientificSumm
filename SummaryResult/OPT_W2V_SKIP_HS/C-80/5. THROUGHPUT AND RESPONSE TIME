For the Authoring mix, at 800 test clients at 5 Mb/s, Figure 7 (a) shows that Native"s throughput increase by 85% when compared to the original benchmark while Ganesh"s improvement is smaller at 15%.
While the throughput for both remains the same at 800 test clients, Figure 8 (d) shows that Ganesh"s  average response time is 62% lower than Native.
Compared to Native, Figure 6 (b) shows that Ganesh"s response times are substantially lower with sub-second response times at 400 clients.
