To the best of our knowledge, Ganesh is the first system that combines the use of hash-based techniques with caching of database results to improve throughput and response times for applications with dynamic content.
Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching  solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in query planing and distributed query processing.
Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web pages.
This and other hash-based systems such as the CASPER [ 37 ]
