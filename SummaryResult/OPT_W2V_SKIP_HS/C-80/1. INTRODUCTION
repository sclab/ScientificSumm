This is in contrast to previous work which presumed availability of source code.
Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use of hash-based techniques.
Even when database content remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors.
This causes user  experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to  insulate the client from bursty loads.
However, these techniques have not been used for relational databases.
