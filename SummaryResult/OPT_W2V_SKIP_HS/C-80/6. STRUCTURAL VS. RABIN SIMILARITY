As Ganesh always performed better than Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in the interests of brevity.
With the order of the rows changing in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning  different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.
Figure 8: AUCTION Benchmark - Throughput and Average Response Time the chunking algorithm and the second with Ganesh"s row-based algorithm.
At 5 and 20 Mb/s , the addition of test clients decreases the normalized response time as Ganesh '' s average response time increases faster than Rabin '' s. However
