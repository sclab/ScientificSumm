The only exception to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds to the average response time.
Looking at the Authoring mix of the original BBOARD  benchmark, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s.
Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput  improvement at lower bandwidths.
It is only at higher bandwidths that latency , measured by the average response time for a client request , and throughput , measured by the number of
