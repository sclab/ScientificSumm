Furthermore, Browsing features alone have higher precision (with lower maximum recall achieved) than considering all of the features in our UserBehavior model.
Our UserBehavior strategy achieves recall of over 0.43 with precision of over 0.67 (with much higher precision at lower recall levels), substantially outperforms the current search engine preference ranking and all other implicit feedback interpretation methods. 
Because of the skewed distribution of user clicks our clickthrough-only strategies have high precision, but low recall (i.e., do not attempt to predict relevance of many search results).
Nevertheless , our CD+CDiff clickthrough strategy outperforms most recent state-of-the-art results by a large
