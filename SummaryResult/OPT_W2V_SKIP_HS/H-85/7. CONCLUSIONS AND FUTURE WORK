While our techniques perform well on average, our assumptions about clickthrough distributions (and learning the user behavior models) may not hold equally well for all queries.
As we showed in this paper, using the wisdom of crowds can give us accurate interpretation of user interactions even in the inherently noisy web search setting.
A natural application of our preference prediction models is to improve web search ranking [1].
Alternatively, our models could be used directly to detect anomalies in user behavior - either due to abuse or to operational problems with the search engine.
