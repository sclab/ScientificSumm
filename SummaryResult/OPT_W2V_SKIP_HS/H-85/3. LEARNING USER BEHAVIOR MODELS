This reflects the fact that search engines do a reasonable job of ranking results as well as biases to click top results and  noisewe attempt to separate these components in the analysis that follows.
In order to reduce the effect of individual user variations in behavior, we average observed feature values across all users and search sessions for each query-URL pair.
Hence , in addition to basic features , which we will describe in detail in Section 3.2 , we compute derived features that measure the deviation of the observed feature value for a given search result from the expected
