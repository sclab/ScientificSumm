By using the aggregated behavior of large numbers of users (and not treating each user as an individual expert) we can correct for the noise inherent in individual interactions, and generate relevance judgments that are more accurate than techniques not specifically designed for the web search setting.
If we could turn these interactions into relevance judgments, we could obtain large amounts of data for evaluating, maintaining, and improving information retrieval systems.
Relevance measurement is crucial to web search and to information retrieval in general.
We discuss our results and outline future directions and various applications of this work in Section
