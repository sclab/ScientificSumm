Hence, all strategies except for UserBehavior were tested on the full set of queries and associated relevance preferences, while UserBehavior was tested on a randomly chosen hold-out subset of the queries as described above.
â€¢ CDiff: Our generalization of the CD strategy that explicitly uses the relevance component of clickthrough probabilities to induce preferences between search results (Section 4.2).
In addition for these queries we also had user interaction data for more than 120,000 instances of these queries.
We compared our UserBehavior model ( Section 4.3 ) to previously published implicit feedback interpretation techniques and some variants of these approaches
