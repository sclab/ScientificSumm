ln }) ⇒ l = arg max l ∈L g(l )(h(l )) but since it will usually be unrealistic to compute the  optimal next learning step in every situation, it is more useful 2 Note that our outlook is not only different from common, cooperative models of distributed machine learning and data mining, but also delineates our approach from multiagent learning systems in which agents learn about other agents [25], i.e.
We denote the set of all possible learning processes by L ( ignoring , for ease of notation , the fact that this set depends on H , D and
