In our experiments, g and g are calculated by an additional agent that acts as a global  validation mechanism for all agents (in a more realistic setting a comparison mechanism for different g functions would have to be provided).
As for (iii), each agent uses a single model merging  operator taken from the following two classes of operators (hj is the receiver"s own model and hi is the provider"s model): • ph→h (hi, hj) : - m-join: The m best clusters (in terms of coverage of Dj) from hypothesis hi are appended to hj.
We assume that agents
