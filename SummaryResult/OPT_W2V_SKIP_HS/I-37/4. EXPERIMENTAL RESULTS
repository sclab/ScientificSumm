Apart from these obvious performance benefits,  integrating partial learning results can also have other advantages: The m-filter operation, for example, decreases the number of learning samples and thus can speed up the learning  process.
We can see that the quality of these operations is very close to the Single Agent that has access to all training data.
For m-join and m-filter we assume m = 3 to limit the extent to which models increase over time.
k-means k-medoids filtering 30-40 % 10-20 % m-filtering 20-30 % 5-15 % The overall conclusion we can draw from these initial experiments with our architecture
