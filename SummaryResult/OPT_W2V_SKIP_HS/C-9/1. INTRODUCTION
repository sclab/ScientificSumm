Current grid computing infrastructures don"t  provide sufficient support for the execution of distributed,  useraccessed, long-term services as they are designed to solve compute- or data-intensive tasks with a more or less fixed set of parameters.
The overall goal is to provide a generic service architecture that allows to implement the service functionality once, and then, ideally, run this  service with different service models and adapt it at run-time, thereby scaling from a single user local instance to a  multidomain-spanning scalable service.
To provide resources as needed , our approach automatically rededicates evenly free or not needed resources between
