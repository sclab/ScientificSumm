Our experiments also show that we can do fairly well on dependencies using only surface-features such as  cosinesimilarity and time-stamps of news stories as long as true events are provided to the system.
In this paper, we also proposed a few approaches for both clustering stories into events and constructing dependencies among them.
We developed a  timedecay based clustering approach that takes advantage of  temporallocalization of news stories on the same event and showed that it performs significantly better than the baseline approach based on cosine similarity.
Our results indicate modeling dependencies can be a very hard problem especially when
