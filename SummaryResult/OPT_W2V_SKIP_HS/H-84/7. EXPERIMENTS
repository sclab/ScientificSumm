On the whole, we observe that the surface-level features we used capture the dependencies to a  reasonable level achieving a best value of 0.72 DF on the test set.
As a baseline, we use a combination of the baselines in each  components, i.e., cos for clustering and complete-link for dependencies.
The results on the test set present a very similar story as shown in table 7.
The results on the training set , also presented in table 6 , indicate that cos+TD+Simple-Thresholding is significantly better than the baseline in terms of the joint F-value JF , using a one-tailed paired
