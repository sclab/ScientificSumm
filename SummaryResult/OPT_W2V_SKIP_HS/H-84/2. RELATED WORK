However, in TDT-2003, a hierarchical structure of topic detection has been proposed and [2] made useful attempts to adopt the new structure.
In a work closest to ours, Makkonen [8] suggested modeling news topics in terms of its evolving events.
Also their algorithms are tuned to work on specific genres of topics such as earthquakes, accidents, etc., while we expect our algorithms to generalize over any topic.
Our work differs from theirs in that we do not  constrain the dependency to be linear.
The hierarchy within a topic does impose a structure on the topic , but we do not
