We supervised the annotator on a set of three topics that we did our own annotations on and then asked her to annotate the 28 topics from TDT2 and 25 topics from TDT3.
If the topic contained more than 30 CNN stories, we picked only the first 30 stories to keep the topic short enough for  annotators.
Annotation includes defining the event membership for each story and also the  dependencies.
The reason for choosing only CNN as the source is that the stories from this source tend to be short and precise and do not tend to digress or drift
