In the realm of software architectures, the paper proposes a connector-based model of multi-agent interactions which attempts to identify the essential structure underlying multi-agent interactions.
The main hypothesis motivating this paper is that the variety of multi-agent  interaction mechanisms - both, organizational and  communicative, share a common semantic core.
The social stance advocated by institutional frameworks and most multi-agent system methodologies has resulted in a wide spectrum of organizational and communicative  abstractions which have found currency in several programming frameworks and software platforms.
Still , these tools and frameworks are designed to support a limited range of interaction capabilities that constrain
