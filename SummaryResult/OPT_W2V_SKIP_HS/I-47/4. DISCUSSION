Thus, the proposed model is not intended to capture every organizational or communicative feature of multi-agent interactions, but to reveal their roots in basic interaction mechanisms.
In the realm of software architectures, this core has been formalised as an operational model of social  connectors, intended to describe both the basic structure and  dynamics of multi-agent interactions, from the largest (the agent society itself) down to the smallest ones  (communicative actions).
Thus, top-level interactions may represent the kind of agent-web pursued by large-scale initiatives such as the Agentcities/openNet one [25].
