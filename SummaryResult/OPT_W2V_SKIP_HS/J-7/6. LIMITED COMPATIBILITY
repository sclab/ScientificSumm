In particular, we consider a situation in which initially, two technologies B and C with zero compatibility are at a stable state.
By a stable state, we mean that no finite  perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either B or C. We also have a technology A that is superior to both B and C, and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose A.
However , once these nodes have adopted B , the best-response for each node of the form u ( 1 , y ) is A ( A generates
