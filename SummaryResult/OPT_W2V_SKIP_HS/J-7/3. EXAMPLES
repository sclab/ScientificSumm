change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2,  every agent will switch to strategy A, and hence A becomes an  epidemic.4 4 Strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as a single infinite sequence of vertices in V (G) \ T, the order 1, −1, 2, −2, .
Figure 2 shows a picture of L6 Now, assume that starting from a position where every node uses the strategy B, we endow all agents in a group (say, group 0) with the strategy A.
3 Note that we assume agents in the seed set T cannot change their strategy.
However
