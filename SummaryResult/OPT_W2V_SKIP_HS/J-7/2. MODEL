For T ⊆ V ( G ) , we denote by sT the strategy profile that assigns A to every agent in T and B to every agent in V ( G ) \ T. We say that technology A can become an epidemic in the game ( G , q , r ) if there is a finite set T of nodes in G ( called the seed set ) and a sequence S of vertices in V ( G ) \ T ( where each vertex can appear more than once ) such that sT S → sV
