Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite; we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has degree Δ.1 We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of whether a new technology A can spread through a network where almost everyone is initially using B.
Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied: the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility (encoded by c).
We describe it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario
