Allowing such equilibria with crossing bids we can find the minimum profit a trader or set of traders can make, by minimizing the value yt (or sum P tâˆˆT yt) over all optimal  solutions that satisfy pi = 0 whenever i is connected to only a single trader.
Note that a seller or buyer i connected to a single trader t cannot have profit at equilibrium, so possible equilibrium profits are in one-to-one correspondence with dual solutions for which pi = 0 whenever i is monopolized by one trader.
Thus there is an optimal solution in which pi = 0 for
