Eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the  utility (wtp) of one full outcome (the reference outcome Î¸0 ), and then obtaining the function over each maximal clique using monetary differences between its possible assignments (technique known as pricing out [17]), keeping the variables in the conditional set fixed.
We assume that the agent has a preference order over outcome space, represented by a set of attributes A, and an attribute p representing monetary consequence.
We note that the wtp function is used extensively in economics , and that all the development in Section 3 could be performed directly in
