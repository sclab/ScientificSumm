It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of  preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyer"s information revelation and the time required for convergence. 
It is therefore essential only that the buyer"s preference structure is accurately modeled.
Of course, capturing sellers" structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.
The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of
