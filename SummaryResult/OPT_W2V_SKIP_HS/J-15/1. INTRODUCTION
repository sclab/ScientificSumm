To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.
Constructing and  communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical  multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some  simplified form.
After laying out this  infrastructure, we employ this representation tool for the development of a multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to  express their complex preferences in GAI format.
On the other hand , fully general
