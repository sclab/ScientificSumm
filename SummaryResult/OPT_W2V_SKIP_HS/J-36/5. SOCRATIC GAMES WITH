A Bayesian game is strategically zero sum if the classical game A, u(·, t) is strategically zero sum for every t ∈ T. Whether a Bayesian game is strategically zero sum can be determined as in Theorem 3.1.
By Lemma 5.5, we can also compute correlated equilibria in any observable-query Socratic game for which Nash  equilibria are computable in the induced Gstage2(q) games (e.g., when Gstage2(q) is of constant size).
Define an unobservable-query Socratic game G∗ with one possible world for each t ∈ T , one available zero-cost query qi for each Player i so that
