When one can infer a polynomial bound on the number of queries made by a rational player, then our results yield efficient solutions.
Our techniques allow us to compute equilibria in such a stochastic-query model provided that each query is represented as a table that, for each world/signal pair, lists the probability that the query outputs that signal in that world.
Conversely, it is NP-hard to compute a Nash  equilibrium for such a game when every δ({γ}) ≤ 1/|W|2 , even when the worlds are constant sum and Player II has only a single available strategy.
In a correlated equilibrium
