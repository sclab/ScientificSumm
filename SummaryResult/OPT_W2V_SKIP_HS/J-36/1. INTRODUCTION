This approach contrasts with traditional game theory, in which players are usually modeled as having fixed, exogenously given  information about the structure of the game and its payoffs.
Compared to traditional game theory, the distinguishing feature of our model is the introduction of explicit costs to the players for learning arbitrary partial  information about which of the many possible worlds is the real world.
Worse yet, a Socratic game with  strategically zero-sum worlds is not itself classically strategically zero sum-indeed, there are no known efficient  algorithmic techniques to compute Nash equilibria in the resulting class of classical games.
In this
