A key point from our perspective is that the complexity of the matching is similar to the complexity of optimizing a single  function, since the sum function is in the form (2) as well.
Associating a  single quantity and payment with a set of configurations expresses indifference among them; hence we refer to such a set as an  indifference range.3 Indifference ranges include the case of attributes with a natural ordering, in which a bid specifies a minimum or maximum acceptable attribute level.
First , as noted above , the theory is developed for utility functions , which may behave
