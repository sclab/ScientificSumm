In particular, we use the framework to  explore tradeoffs between expressive power of agent bids and  computational properties of auction clearing.
Constructing an optimal overall matching may require consideration of many different  combina1 In the interim between clears, call markets may also disseminate price quotes providing summary information about the state of the auction [24].
The role of the auction is to elicit these functions (possibly approximate or partial versions), and identify the surplus-maximizing deal.
This problem can be translated into the more familiar auction for a single good without attributes by computing a score for each attribute vector based
