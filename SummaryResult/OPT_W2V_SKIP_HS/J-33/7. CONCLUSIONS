The extent to which the space of feasible mechanisms may be quantified a priori will facilitate the search for such exchanges in the full mechanism design problem.
In this work, we investigate the space of two-sided multiattribute auctions, focusing on the relationship between constraints on the offers traders can express through bids, and the resulting  computational problem of determining an optimal set of trades.
The implementation and deployment of market exchanges requires the development of bidding languages , information feedback policies , and clearing algorithms that are suitable for the target domain , while paying heed to the incentive properties
