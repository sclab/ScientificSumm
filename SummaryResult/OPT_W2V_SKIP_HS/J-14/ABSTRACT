In this paper, we show that if the underlying graph is a bounded-degree tree and the best response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient  algorithm which constructs a Nash equilibrium that guarantees certain payoffs to all participants.
We show that, while exactly computing the latter is infeasible (we prove that  solving this problem may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily high degree), there exists an FPTAS for finding such an equilibrium as long as the best response policy has polynomial size.
This paper addresses the problem of fair equilibrium selection in graphical games.
These two algorithms can
