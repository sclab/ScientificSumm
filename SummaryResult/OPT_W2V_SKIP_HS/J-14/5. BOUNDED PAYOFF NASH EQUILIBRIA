if such a pair of indices exists, we  instruct Vn to play xk n and use dynamic programming techniques (or, equivalently, the downstream pass of the algorithm of [13]) to find a Nash equilibrium s that satisfies EPVi (s ) ≥ Ti − for i = 1, .
, n. We construct a strategy profile ti = max { xj i | xj i ≤ si } and use the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 3 to show that t is a Nash equilibrium for G. By Lemma 3 , we have |EPVi ( s ) − EPVi ( t
