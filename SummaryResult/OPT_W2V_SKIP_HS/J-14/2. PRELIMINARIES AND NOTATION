For any set A ⊆ [0, 1]2 that is represented as a union of a finite number of rectangles, we say that a point u ∈ [0, 1] on the U-axis is a  Uevent point of A if u = 0 or u = 1 or the representation of A contains a rectangle of the form IV × IU and u is an endpoint of IU ; V -event points are defined similarly.
A mixed strategy of a player V is represented as a single number v ∈ [0, 1], which denotes the probability that V selects action 1.
The proof that
