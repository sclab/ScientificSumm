Further work in this vein could include extensions to the kinds of guarantees sought for Nash equilibria, such as guaranteeing total payoffs for subsets of players, selecting equilibria in which some players are receiving significantly higher payoffs than their peers, etc.
At the moment however, it is perhaps more important to  inves170 tigate whether Nash equilibria of graphical games can be computed in a decentralized manner, in contrast to the algorithms we have  introduced here.
As argued in the introduction, there are several reasons to prefer a solution that constitutes an exact Nash equilibrium.
Then checking if there is a
