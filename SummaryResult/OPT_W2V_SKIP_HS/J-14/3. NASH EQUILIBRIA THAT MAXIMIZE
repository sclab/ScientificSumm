It is easy to check that for any u ∈ [0, 1], the vector (u, 1/2, f(u)) is a Nash equilibrium.
It  follows that to find a Nash equilibrium with the highest total payoff, we have to maximize Pk−1 i=1 Ti subject to conditions u−1 ∈ [0, 1], u0 = (x −x )u−1+x , u1 = u0/(u0+1), and ui+1 = 1/(2−ui) for i = 1, .
The payoff to U−1 is 0, and the  expected payoff to each of the Ui, i = 0, .
Observe that as u−1 varies from 0 to 1, u varies from x to x .
Second , we construct a
