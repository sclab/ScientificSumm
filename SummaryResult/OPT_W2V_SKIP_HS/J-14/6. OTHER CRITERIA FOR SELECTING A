We conclude that whenever such a Nash  equilibrium s exists, our algorithm outputs a Nash equilibrium t that satisfies |EPVi (t) − EPVj (t)| ≤ ξ + 4 for all i, j = 1, .
It is not hard to check that for any p ∈ R, if there is a Nash equilibrium s such that mini=1,...,n EPVi (s) ≥ p, then our algorithm outputs a Nash equilibrium s that satisfies mini=1,...,n EPVi (s) ≥ p−2 .
Finally , as in the proof of Theorem 3 , we use ml , k n to select the best discrete Nash equilibrium
