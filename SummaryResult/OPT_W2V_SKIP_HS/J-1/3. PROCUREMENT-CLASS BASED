As a possible Ei(A, s) is ∪j∈sRj(A, s) one can bound the maximal value of i"s external competition W(Ei(A, s)) by the sum of the maximal values of the rest of the players in s 8 since the domain is a procurement class domain we can use lemma 3.1 24 internal competition i.e., j∈s max W(Rj(A, s)).
By the definition of a critical value pricing scheme 2.2 and the GTR-1 algorithm 3.1 it follows that for every trading player i, vi ≥ 0.
By the critical value pricing scheme definition 2.2 it
