There have been several attempts to circumvent [15] by  trading welfare for BB, e.g., in domains such as double-sided auctions[13], distributed markets[3] and supply chain  problems[2, 4].
It is well known [15] that it is impossible for a mechanism to maximize social welfare whilst also being IR, IC, and BB.
When designing a mechanism there are several desirable properties to maintain such as incentive compatibility (IC), individual rationality (IR), and budget balance (BB).
In particular , our results improve on existing solutions for problems such as double sided markets with homogenous goods , distributed markets and several
