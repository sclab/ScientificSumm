Another interesting example is the open question left by [3]:How can one bound the loss in social welfare that is needed to achieve budget balance in an IR and IC distributed market where the transportation edges are strategic.
A particularly interesting case is one in which the input mechanism is an efficient allocation.
Despite the works discussed above, the question of how to design a general mechanism that achieves IR, IC, and BB independently of the problem domain remains open.
For the homogeneous doublesided auctions the GTR solution procedure improves on the well known solution [ 13 ] by
