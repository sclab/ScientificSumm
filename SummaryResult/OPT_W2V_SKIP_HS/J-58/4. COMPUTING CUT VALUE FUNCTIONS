An agent i is selected if and only if there is a j such that (1) i is selected in ψj (c), and (2) the allocation rule O will select index j under cost profile F(c).
To compute the cut value, we assume that (1) the cut value r for each round r can be computed in polynomial time; (2) we can solve the equation gr(x) = r to find x in polynomial time when the cost vector c−i and b are given.
One way to find an approximation of the Steiner tree is as follows : ( 1
