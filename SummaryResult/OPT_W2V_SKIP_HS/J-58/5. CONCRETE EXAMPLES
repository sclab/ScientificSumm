5: r = r + 1 6: Output R. Let GSC(S) be the sets selected by the Algorithm 7.Notice that the output set is a function of S and c. Some works assume that the type of an agent could be ci, i.e., Si is assumed to be a  public knowledge.
Thus, for an agent i, we first focus on the output of one round r. In round r, if i is  selected by Algorithm 7, then it has the minimum ratio ci |Siâˆ’Tr| among all remaining agents.
In round r , the cut value for a link ei can be
