For any strategy-proof mechanism for a binary demand game G with setting S, if we fix the cost c−i of all agents other than i, the payment to agent i is a constant p1 i if Oi(c) = 1, and it is another constant p0 i if Oi(c) = 0.
When ci = κi(O, c−i), Oi(c) can be  either 0 or 1 depending on the tie-breaker of the allocation rule O. Hereafter, we will not consider the tie-breaker scenario in our proofs.
Now consider the scenario when the actual valuation of agent i is ci = ci2 .
Thus , its
