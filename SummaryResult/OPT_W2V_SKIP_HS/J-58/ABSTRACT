In light of these limitations, it is useful to study whether we can design a truthful non-VCG payment scheme that is computationally tractable for a given allocation rule O.
The family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms is  arguably the most celebrated achievement in truthful mechanism  design.
If we apply VCG mechanisms to polynomial-time algorithms that approximate the optimal solution, the resulting mechanisms may no longer be truthful.
For many optimization problems, finding the optimal output is computationally intractable.
In this paper , we focus our attention on binary demand games in which the agents '' only available actions are to take
