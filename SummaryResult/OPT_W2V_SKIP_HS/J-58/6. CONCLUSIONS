We point out here that the goal of this paper is not to design a better allocation rule for a  problem, but to design an algorithm to compute the payments efficiently when O is given.
Towards this research direction, Theorem 4 can be extended to a general  allocation rule O, whose range is R+ .
It would be of significance to design allocation rules with good approximation ratios such that a given binary  demand game has a computationally efficient payment scheme.
It would be of interest to design algorithms to compute P in optimal time.
Another research direction is to design
