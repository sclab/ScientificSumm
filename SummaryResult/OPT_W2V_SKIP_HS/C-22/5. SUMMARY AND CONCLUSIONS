Future work will also involve the evaluation of a broad range of adaptation scenarios on the MobJeX framework to quantity the gains that can be made via adaptation through object mobility and thus demonstrate in practise, the efficacy of the solution described in this paper.
In addition, further testing provided an initial indication of the characteristics of application objects (based on method execution time) that would be good candidates for adaptation using the worst case implementation of the proposed metrics collection strategy.
One such approach could be based on maintaining metrics history in order to determine the temporal behaviour of
