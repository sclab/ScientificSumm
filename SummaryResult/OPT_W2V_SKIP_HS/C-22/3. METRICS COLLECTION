The primary advantage of aggregating metrics in containers is that it allows them to be propagated easily as a cohesive unit through the components of the mobility framework so that they can be delivered to the adaptation engine, as discussed in the following subsection.
Since a MetricsContainer can have multiple Metric objects, of which it has explicit domain knowledge, it is able to determine if, when, and how many of these metrics should be propagated to the ModelEntity and thus become candidates for being part of the hierarchical ModelEntity push process as described below.
Therefore , due to the presence
