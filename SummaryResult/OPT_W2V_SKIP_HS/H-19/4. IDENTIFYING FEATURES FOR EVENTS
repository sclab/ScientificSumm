The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).
Clearly, the trajectory of your is very different from beenb, which means that the former has to be considered separately.
( Dominant Power Spectrum ) The dominant power spectrum ( DPS ) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS
