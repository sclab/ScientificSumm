(1) Since KL-divergence is not symmetric, we define the  similarity between between fi and fj as the maximum of KL(fi|fj ) and KL(fj |fi).
6.1 Feature Correlation If two features fi and fj are representative of the same event, they must satisfy the following necessary conditions: 1. fi and fj are identically distributed: yfi âˆ¼ yfj .
1 is employed to compute the similarity between two periodic features, Next, we define the overal similarity among a set of  features R using the maximum inter-feature KL-Divergence value as follows.
( 3 ) The burst analysis for event e is exactly the
