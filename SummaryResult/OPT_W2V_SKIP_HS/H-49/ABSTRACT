Previous work addresses the evaluation of systems, the ranking of queries by difficulty, and the ranking of individual retrievals by  performance.
Our focus is on zero-judgment  performance prediction of individual retrievals.
We also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance prediction for a massive number of retrieval systems over a variety of collections in several languages.
One common shortcoming of previous techniques is the  assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments.
When compared to a state of the art baseline, we demonstrate that the spatial analysis of retrieval scores provides significantly better prediction performance.
