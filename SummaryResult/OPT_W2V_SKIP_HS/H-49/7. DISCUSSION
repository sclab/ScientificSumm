It is important before applying this measure to confirm that, given the semantics for some link between two retrieved items, we should expect a correlation between scores. 
We should make it clear that we have selected tasks where topical autocorrelation is appropriate.
With some exceptions, the correlation of document scores has largely been ignored.
For example, a system may need to, at retrieval time, assess its performance before deciding to conduct more intensive processing such as pseudo-relevance feedback or interaction.
Similarly , answer candidates in a question-answering task may or may not exhibit autocorrelation ; in this case , the
