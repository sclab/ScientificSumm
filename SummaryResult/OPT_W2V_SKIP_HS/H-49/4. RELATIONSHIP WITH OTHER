The information introduced by the query, though, is retrieval-independent so that, if two  retrievals return the same set of documents, the approximate Cox-Lewis statistic will be the same regardless of the  retrieval scores.
PREDICTORS One way to predict the effectiveness of a retrieval is to look at the shared vocabulary of the top n retrieved  documents.
The similarity between the retrieval and the combined retrieval may be computed using some  correlation measure.
In Figure 2a, this is roughly equivalent to measuring the area of the set n. Notice that we are throwing away information about the retrieval function y.
