3.3 Correlation with Other Retrievals Sometimes we are interested in the performance of a single retrieval but have access to scores from multiple systems for (a) IM = 0.006 (b) IM = 0.241 (c) IM = 0.487 Figure 1: The Moran coefficient, IM for a several binary functions on a grid.
If we want to quantify the spatial dependencies of a  function, we would employ a measure referred to as the spatial autocorrelation [5, 10].
We use the term function here to mean a mapping from a location to a real value.
We present some examples of autocorrelations of functions on a grid
