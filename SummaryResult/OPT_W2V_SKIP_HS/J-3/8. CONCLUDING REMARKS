If the scenario does not change from day to day, this simple strategy will have the same theoretical properties as our one-bid strategy, and in practice, is likely to be much better.
Finally, we have looked at this system as a black box returning clicks as a function of bid, whereas in reality it is a complex repeated game involving multiple  advertisers.
In [3], it was shown that when a set of advertisers use a strategy similar to the one we suggest here, under a slightly modified first-price auction, the prices approach a well-understood market equilibrium.
Another interesting generalization is
