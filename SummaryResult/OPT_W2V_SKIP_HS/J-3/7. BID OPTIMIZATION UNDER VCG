But, the equation above shows that each piece has its  incremental cpc equal to the bid that achieves it; thus in the case of VCG the pieces are also sorted by bid.
Now consider running the algorithm described in  Section 2.1.4 for finding the optimal bids for a set of queries.
For the sake of the budget optimization problem we can define VCG by just redefining costq(b) (replacing Equation (2)): costq(b) = p−1 X j=i (α[j] − α[j + 1]) · b[j] where i = pos(b).
Observation 1 still holds , and we can construct a landscape
