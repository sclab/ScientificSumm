For any possible bid b, if we use the aggregate landscape just as we would a regular landscape, we exactly represent the cost and clicks associated with making that bid  simultaneously on all queries associated with the aggregate  landscape.
Define a two-bid strategy to be a uniform strategy which puts non-zero weight on at most two bid vectors.
We define a uniform bidding strategy to be a distribution A over bid vectors a âˆˆ R |K| + where each bid vector in the distribution is of the form (b, b, .
Given an instance of Budget Optimization in which there are a
