If the graph G has the laminar property, then, by applying Lemma 11, the dynamic programming recurrence in (5), and Lemma 9, we can find an optimal solution to the Budget Optimization problem in O(B3 U3 n) time.
We can solve this problem by showing that given any laminar ordering, there is an equivalent one in which each keyword has at most 2 children.
In addition, we can apply Lemma 9 to compute the  optimal (randomized) solution.
In this case we say that j is a child of i.
For this definition , we use Z ( b ,
