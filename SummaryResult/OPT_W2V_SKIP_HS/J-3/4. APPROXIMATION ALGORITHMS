4.3.2 Proof of Theorem 3 By Lemma 4, we know that for each r ≤ UΩ, there is a strategy that can obtain traffic r at cost r · h(r).
To calculate the spend of this strategy consider two cases: if u = 0 then we are bidding h(v) with probability pv = α/v.
4.3 A (1 − 1 e )-approximation algorithm The key to the proof of Theorem 3 is to show that there is a distribution over single-bid strategies from Lemma 4 that obtains at least (1 − 1 e )CΩ clicks.
Interestingly , the equivalence between this
