The basic idea: for  determining some unknown value of one bidder we must raise 24 Note that an anonymous ascending auction cannot  necessarily elicit a class that can be fully elicited by an ascending auction.
If every bidder demands a single  bundle in each step of the auction, conservative auctions may run for an exponential number of steps even for additive  valuations.
We also observe that in conservative auctions , allowing the bidders to submit all the bundles in their demand sets ensures that the auction runs a polynomial number of steps - if L is not too high
