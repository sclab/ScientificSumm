This is because that  ascending auctions can usually not achieve such running times (consider even the English auction on a single item).16 Note that all of our results give concrete bounds, where the  dependence on the parameters is given explicitly; we use the standard big-Oh notation just as a shorthand.
Formally, let p be a query made for bidder i, and q be a query made for bidder i at a later stage in the protocol.
Thus, in some parts of the paper we assume without loss of generality that Î´ = 1, hence all valuations are integral.
In such
