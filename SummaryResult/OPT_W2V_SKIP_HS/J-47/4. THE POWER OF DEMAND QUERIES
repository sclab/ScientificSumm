First we note that value queries are not completely powerless: In [19] it is shown that if the m items are split into k fixed bundles of size m/k each, and these fixed bundles are  auctioned as though each was indivisible, then the social welfare bers, thus we may have bundles with arbitrarily close  relative demands.
Any iterative auction that uses only value queries and distinguishes between k-tuples of 0/1 valuations where the optimal allocation has value 1, and those where the optimal allocation has value k requires at least 2 m k queries.
When the relative-demand query prices are
