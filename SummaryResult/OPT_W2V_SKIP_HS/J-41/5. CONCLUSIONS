In general second pricing allows for multiple pure-strategy equilibria, but we showed that the value of such equilibria diverges by only a constant factor from the value obtained if all agents bid truthfully (which in the case of RBR is the efficient value). 
We first studied the short-run setting with incomplete information, corresponding to the case where agents have just approached the mechanism.
We hope that the tools we used to establish these results (revenue equivalence, the form of first-price equilibria, the truthful payments rules) will help others wanting to pursue further analyses of slot auctions.
We also studied the
