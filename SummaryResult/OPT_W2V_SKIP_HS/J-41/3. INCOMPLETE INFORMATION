Because a RBB auction ranks agents by their true values in  equilibrium for any of these payment rules (by Lemma 1), it follows that expected revenue is the same for all these  payment rules, following arguments that are virtually identical to those used to establish revenue equivalence in the  singleitem case (see e.g.
Using Propositions 1 and 2, it is a simple matter to  derive formulae for the expected revenue under both allocation rules.
As a consequence of this lemma , we find that RBB and RBR auctions allocate the slots greedily by the true values and revenues of the
