We consider both the short-run  incomplete information setting and the long-run complete  information setting.
In this paper we analyze the  incentive, efficiency, and revenue properties of two slot  auction designs: rank by bid (RBB) and rank by revenue (RBR), which correspond to stylized versions of the  mechanisms currently used by Yahoo!
We show that there typically exists a multitude of equilibria with second pricing, and we bound the divergence of (economic) value in such equilibria from the value obtained assuming all merchants bid truthfully.
With complete information , we find that no equilibrium exists with first pricing using either RBB
