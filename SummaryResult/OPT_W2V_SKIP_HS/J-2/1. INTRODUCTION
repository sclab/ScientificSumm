Around the same time, the same mechanism has been  independently derived by Moulin [19].1 Moulin actually  pursues a different objective (also based on worst-case analysis): whereas our objective is to maximize the percentage of VCG payments that are redistributed, Moulin tries to minimize the overall payments from agents as a percentage of  efficiency.
One way of trying to  design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the agents" incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained), and that will maintain the other properties.
