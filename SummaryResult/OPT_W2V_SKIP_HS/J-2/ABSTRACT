Here we propose a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents.
We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and show how to cast this model as a linear program.
However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among  themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents.
The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special
