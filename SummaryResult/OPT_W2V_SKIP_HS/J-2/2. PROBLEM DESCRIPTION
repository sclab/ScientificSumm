We do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi; because of this, ai"s  incentives are unaffected by this redistribution payment, and the mechanism remains strategy-proof. 
Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.
(This assumption is not harmful: in environments where anyone can join the auction, running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway, because everyone would want to join to collect part of the redistribution.)
After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ai"s redistribution payment.
We only consider the
