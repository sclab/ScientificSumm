Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on  designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents" preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).
This work is part of a growing literature on designing mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case.
It does not appear that there are direct connections between our work and these other works that focus on designing  mechanisms that perform well in the worst case.
