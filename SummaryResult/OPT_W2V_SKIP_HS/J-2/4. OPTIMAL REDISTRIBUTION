Moreover, there are actually infinitely many mechanisms that redistribute 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case-for example, any convex combination of the above two will redistribute 100% if both ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 and ˆvm+3 = 0.
Thus, this mechanism also redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case.
When n = 6 and m = 1 , for the first example ( Bailey-Cavallo mechanism ) , the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 2 3 , and for the second example , this percentage is 1 2 , which implies that for this pair of
