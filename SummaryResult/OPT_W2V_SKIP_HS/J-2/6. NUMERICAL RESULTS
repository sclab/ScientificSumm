For n = 20, this is 5.26e − 3, whereas the remaining percentage for the worst-case optimal mechanism is 3.62e−5 in the worst case.
We see that for any m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (actually, in this case, the worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the  BaileyCavallo mechanism).
The theory of order statistics tells us that the 34 joint probability density function of ˆv2 and ˆv3 is f(ˆv3, ˆv2) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)ˆvn−3 3 (1 − ˆv2) for ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3.
