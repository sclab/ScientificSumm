It is helpful to see the entire list of redistribution  payments: z1 = c0 + c1ˆv2 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + .
Example 1 (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism): Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n and ci = 0 for all other i.
If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent always receives a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism is individually rational.
Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any bid vector, zn ≥ 0.
We define the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms corresponding
