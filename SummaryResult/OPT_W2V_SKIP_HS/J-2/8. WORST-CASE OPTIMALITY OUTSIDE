These bid vectors together with the non-deficit constraint and worst-case constraint produce the above set of  inequalities: for example, when j = m + 1, we consider the bid vector ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ m + 1 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
Now, let us consider the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.
, ˆvn) for all bid vectors and all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Because the mechanism is anonymous, two agents should receive the same redistribution payment if their bids are the same.
Hence , the total redistribution payment should be
