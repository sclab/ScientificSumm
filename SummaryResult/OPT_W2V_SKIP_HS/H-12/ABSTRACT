In this paper we  explore the algorithms and data structures required as part of a search engine to allow efficient generation of query biased snippets.
These experiments reveal that finding documents on  secondary storage dominates the total cost of generating  snippets, and so caching documents in RAM is essential for a fast snippet generation process.
Finally we propose and analyse document  reordering and compaction, revealing a scheme that increases the number of document cache hits with only a marginal  affect on snippet quality.
Using simulation, we  examine snippet generation performance for different size RAM caches.
