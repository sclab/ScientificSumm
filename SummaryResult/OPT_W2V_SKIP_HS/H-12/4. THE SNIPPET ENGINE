For snippet generation, the required documents are  decompressed one at a time, and a linear search for provided query terms is employed.
Further, it must have access to the reverse mapping of term numbers,  allowing those words not spelt out in the document to be  recovered and returned to the Query Engine as strings.
4.2 Baseline Snippet Engine An obvious document representation scheme is to simply compress each document with a well known adaptive  compressor, and then decompress the document as required [1], using a string matching algorithm to effect the algorithm in Figure 2.
