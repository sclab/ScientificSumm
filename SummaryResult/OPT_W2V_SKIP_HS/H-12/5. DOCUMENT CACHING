From this figure it is clear that caching even a small  percentage of the documents has a large impact on reducing seek time for snippet generation.
In addition to the document cache, the RAM of the  Snippet Engine must also hold the CTS decoding table that maps integers to strings, which is capped by a parameter at compression time (1 Gb in our experiments here).
that, for a particular collection, some documents are much more likely to appear in results lists than others.
The reason for the large impact of the document cache is 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5
