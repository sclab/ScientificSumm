Given as input a black box for a success function t (when the costs are identical), and a value v, the number of queries that is needed, in the worst case, to find the optimal contract is exponential in n. Proof.
5.1 Binary-Outcome Binary-Action  Technologies Here we assume that we are given a technology and value v as the input, and our output should be the optimal  contract, i.e.
By choosing Î³x close enough to 1 2 , we can make sure that player x will enter the optimal contract only for very large values of v , after all
