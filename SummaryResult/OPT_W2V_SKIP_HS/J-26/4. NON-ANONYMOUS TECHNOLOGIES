In an OOA technology which is a  disjunction of the same anonymous paths (with the same  number of agents, Î³ and c, but over disjoint inputs), for any value v the optimal contract is constructed from some  number of fully-contracted paths.
Thus , the orbit of f is of size at most nl + 1 , where nl is the number of agents in h. Part of the proof of the theorem ( for the complete proof see [ 2 ] ) , is based on such AOO technology being a special case of a more general family of technologies
